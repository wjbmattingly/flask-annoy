  <p id="1">
   Answer: I was born on April 27, 1927, at the place called Krulewiec(ph) in cen — in central Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="2">

  <p id="4">
   Q: Is Lezajsk a town or a district?
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   A: Town.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: And Krulewiec(ph), was that a town or a village?
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: Krulewiec(ph) was a small village.
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: It was a small village. And you’re saying in central Poland’?
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: So, was this west of Warsaw?
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   A: Well, southeast.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: It would have been southeast.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: Southeast of Warsaw.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: Okay. So was it in the eastern part of Poland, even though it was in the middle?
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A: No, as I say, in the central part of Poland. But then, in 1932, my family moved to eastern Poland, which was [indecipherable]. The district was Tarnopol.
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Tarnopol, okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A: This is the eastern part, which was then overrun by Russians.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Okay. We’ll come to that, thank you. Let’s stay with Krulewiec(ph). Since you moved in 1932, you were only a young boy then, but do you have any memories of this — of Krulewiec(ph) at all?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: Yes, I have pretty good memories. It was a fairly well organized village, very new, as a matter of fact. And it was close to a village of importance, was Wola Zarczycka.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Wola Zarezycka?
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: And why was that village important?
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: Because all the homes were pretty new. It was a new village, and — and as I re — as I remember, houses were pretty nice for that period of time. Lot of them were brick, with large lots. Will — buildings were quite new.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: What was the economy of Krulewiec(ph)? What did people make their living from?
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: Oh, I really don’t know very go —
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: What did your family make their living —
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: My — my father was a builder.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Ah, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: So, he used to build homes, and also larger objects like school, or even he helped to build or renovate a church, a village church.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: So — and other people are probably just maybe working in the forest, because there was a forest nearby. So th-th — in timber.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Was it an agricultural place? Were there many farmers?
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Yes, mostly agricul — agricultural, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Okay. And do you remember the house that you lived in, or the place you lived in in Krulewiec(ph)?
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: Yes, Ihave some memory of my — of the house. It was a fra — frame house, a wood — wood frame. And —
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Was it also new? January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: Yes, it was ver — fairly new. And it had other buildings, like the — for — for the animals, for — farm animals were kept in there, and also the one where they kept grain.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: So you had a barn, and a stable. You had a barn for —
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: Yeah, there was a stable, and as a matter of fact, the stable was a brick building.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: That’s pretty unusual.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: Yeah, it’s pretty — a-and I remember there were special facilities for — for the animals, where everything was run down, and I mean, it was pretty clean —
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Oh, you mean when the — where you could wash down the dirt from the animals?
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: Yes, yeah, th-the —
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: Yes, it was concrete floor. And of course, there was also this — a lot of straw on it, but —
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: What color —
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: — underneath there was a concrete floor, and with gutters, so you could wash out — wash the area where the animals were living. And of course, you know, th-there was a different — the separate par — place for horses, also. Because we had cows, and horses.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Did you have any other animals besides cows and horses?
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Well, a— I had a nice dog — dog, a German Shepherd. It was called Rex.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Oh, Rex.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: That’s such a universal name for a German Shepherd.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Ah, well, yeah, it was —
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: The king.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: — very, very good, very intelligent dog.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Yeah. Did your father build this place too, since he was a builder?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: No, it was already there, because when — when — when they — when he left his village — when he was born, he moved into this — it was called a colony really, you know. Like the —
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: It was a colony.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Colony. Kolonia, in Polish. But it was a straight street, very straight street, and houses on both sides of — of the street. And there was a church, there was a blacksmith there, who was very busy all the time. I — I spent some time watching how they were putting shoes on the horses. So, it was interesting to watch.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Yeah, for a little kid. January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: And then there were — there was — well, there were — I — I — a carpenter. There was a big place where the owner was the carpenter, he built furniture and all — all sorts of things. So that — that it’s — that’s about all I can recollect.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Well, that’s a lot. That’s a lot. Did —
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: Yes, and I remember there was a pond at — at the end of this colony. I spend some times cat-catching the frogs in that pond.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: Did your family have land near the house? You kept — you kept farm animals, you kept cows and horses.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: And what were they used for? The cows, I can imagine, for milk.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: Well, the horses were used to toi — to work on the farm.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: So, in other words, you lived on a farm —
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: On — on a farm — no, the farm was attached, or the house was built on a farm, because every owner had a lot behind the house, let’s say, you know, a lot of area, where they would raise grain, and — and cabbage and potatoes.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it’s — it is in some ways unusual for people to — 1t doesn’t sound like you lived in the middle of an agricultural place, insofar as you had a street, you had both houses on the side of theJanuary 24, 2015 street, and — and it | — sounds almost like a small residential area, but not a place that’s a farm area. And — and —
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German extraction.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: Oh, really?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Yes, so it — it — it was even referred like a German colony.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in there, so the buildings I can recollect, were brick buildings, and pretty substantial, let’s say, you know, there’s — they not dilapidated or anything like that, it was — I think it was a fairly new colony.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: Okay. Let’s turn now a little bit to your family. Did you have brothers and sisters?
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: Yes, there were four of us, and two sisters.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: Four brothers and two sisters.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Uh-huh. So, can you tell me their names?
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: Th-The oldest was Jusef(ph), then Franciczek(ph) —
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: So you — you —
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: My oldest brother was born in 1910, and I was born in 1927. So the difference was 17 years, over 17 years —
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: I see. So you —
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: — the family, and I was the last one.

  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: Does that mean that everybody in Krulewiec(ph) came from someplace else, because it was a new colony?January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: M-Most of people probably came from different areas, from around the villages, because I think it was a fairly new settlement, let’s say, like outside of this larger village, Wola Zarezycka.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: But it — it had — it’s na— own name, Krulewiec(ph), but right now, when I look at the maps and everything, kr — kr — it’s just Wola Zarezycka.

  <p id="101">
   A: Yeah, which is quite the large village now.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Expanded a lot, yes, expanded, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Okay. Where had your father come from? What was his birth town — you know, hometown?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: He was born in CharIna(ph), near Lancut(ph). Lancut(ph) is a c-city. It was probably about 10,000 inhabitants. And it was known because there was a castle, owned by a — the Pototskis(ph) family, which 1-in Polish history, Pototskis(ph) are well — very well known —

  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Oh.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: But, I am talking about the early life, because in 1932, my father bought some land in the eastern part of Poland, because there were huge far — farms, owned by counts — hrabias, in Polish, and they were dividing the land for purchase, and a lot of people then purchased this — this land. So we moved from that original area, into the eastern part of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: Okay. I’m going —
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: And that’s where my — most of my youth — of course, that wasn’t long, because from ’32 to 1940, when we were deported to Russia, it’s what, only —
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Eight years.
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: — eight years.
  </p>

  <p id="132">
   Q: Right. Where — so, how mu —
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: Up to the age of 13.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Okay. We’ll come to that. Now, I just want to do a bit of comparison. Your father owned the land in Krulewiec(ph)? Did he own it?
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: He owned the land, and buildings, and yes.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: He was a builder by cro — by profession. But he also owned a little farm.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: All right, how much — how many hectares was the farm?
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: Four.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: Four hectares.
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: Four hectares, including an orchard.
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: Which was right by our house, in the back of the — the lots were very wide —
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: — you know, by —
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: Well, he — four hectares is — it’s maybe small for a farm, but it’s an awful big area for, you know, a lot of land. You know, for a piece of land.
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: Yes, I think it was just average.
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   A: F-Four, five hectares.
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   Q: Could you feed a family from the four or five hectares?
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   A: Oh yes, yes. So —
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: So how many hectares did he buy in eastern Poland’?
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: Seven. He — he bought seven hectares, because that — it was called folwark, which is like a large f-farm owned by count.
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: Okay.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: And they were dividing the land after the war. It was government program —
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: Land reform.
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: — to — to break up this large —
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: Estates.
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: — ownerships.
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: So people were — were able to buy — some people who had some contribution in obtaining the independence of Poland were given land. But my father did not get, he bought it.
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   Q: He bought it.
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   A: He bought it, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   Q: But tell — tell me —
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   A: Because he was a bricklayer, and a builder.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: Okay, tell me this. Seven hectares, compared to four is not that much more. I mean, it is double.
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: But he moved his family across Poland —
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   A: Right.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: — for that. What was the motivation? Because it was seven hectares, rather than four?
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: First of all, the — the — the land was much better in the eastern part, because it — you — you — part of the Ukraine, which was — it was called like the feeding area for the Europe, for Europe.
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   Q: Was the breadbasket of Europe.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   A: Breadbasket for Europe, and I — I don’t know why he didn’t buy more, but actually, that was — that was it. But, as I say, his farming was a part-time actually.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   A: Cause his main income was from —
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Construction.
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   A: — being a builder.
  </p>
  <p id="178">
   Q: Yeah. So did he — did he build that — was there already a house on that land when you moved there, or did he build it? What did that place look like?
  </p>
  <p id="179">
   A: Well, that was another example where the land was being divided because it was owned by hrabia, which is Count Flossik(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: Flossik(ph), mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   A: Yes, he — he own a huge amount of land, and people were buying a lot —
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: Yes, yeah. January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: — like I remember seven new possessions started —
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: — on that land where — where he sold out.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Okay, so seven parcels of land.
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: Seven parcels from this original —
  </p>
  <p id="188">

  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: — big land.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: So some bought more, and other, you know, but there were, again, fairly new, like subdivision. It was there — there was a village, a old, ancient village, and then this new area was built on the land that was subdivided.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: Okay. And paint me a picture with words, of what this place looked like when you were growing up. Did it also have one straw — one street with brick houses on each side?
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: No, it was more like scattered. There was — there were small streets.
  </p>
  <p id="194">
   Q: Could you see your neighbors from your own house?
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: Yes, we could see neighbors. As a matter of fact, we — we were close to four families.
  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: Okay. And were the hou —January 24, 2015

  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: And then little [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: Did your father build the house you lived in there?
  </p>

So everybody was friendly and everything else, helpful. But when the Russians came in, they already put armbands, those local — local Ukrainians, and they started cooperating, collaborating with the Russians. But it wasn’t wrong, because the Russians then arrested those people —

  <p id="791">
   A: Well, early in the morning, on the 10" of February, I think Saturday, they came in. It was still dark outside, maybe five o’clock, something like — we all asleep. So they started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think — I don’t know who was the first, Father, Mother, got up, went to the door, opened the door, they came in. There were about five Russian soldiers with guns — no rifles, with rifles and bayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? Imet’ oruzhiye. That’s in Russian.
  </p>
  <p id="792">
   Q: Imet’ oruzhiye?
  </p>
  <p id="793">
   A: Oruzhiye. Do you have weapons? My father says no, I don’t have any weapon. Although, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know. He didn’t even say nothing, because he couldn’t get to it, or even if he could, he couldn’t do anything, because there’s lo — many of them, these Russian soldiers, well-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are — you are going to be taken away from here. And says, you — you do not belong — you do not belong to here. He says, Father, what? This is my land. No, it’s not yours. We are taking over. It’s no more — no longer it’s yours, you — you have nothing, just pack up whatever you can, food and some clothing.

You had to obey their orders. I mean, Mother was resisting. Whatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw off. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha — with them. She — she — she didn’t — she couldn’t comprehend this, you know, what’s going on. Why — why are you taking us away? What was — where are we going? We don’t know, but you have to move. We’ll — we’ll take you away from here. So she was throwing things off. And the soldiers would put some food, let’s say, food or clothing, or — back on the vehicle, she would throw it back. They threaten her, if you will continue like this, we'll shoot you. This is what — what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law started talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do, because otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That’s what he said. Now, so she calmed down, and we put some stuff on the — on these carriages, and then they drove us away from our home.
  </p>
  <p id="796">
   Q: How much — how much time had they given you to do this?
  </p>
  <p id="797">

So they put all these people together in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out from the school, went back to our house, which wasn’t far, maybe half a mile. So when I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and bacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our dining room. So, I took the violin.

The state is taking over your — your possessions and everything, and they forced us out, by taking us to this school.January 24, 2015 They kept us there for several hours. Course, it was early in the morning, but I think by noon, they moved us to Podkamien, which is the town, because they had better facilities there, larger.

For no — what was ever reason? They wanted — the father and mother wanted to —

  </p>
  <p id="948">
   A: Ah, yes, first of all, the Polish railroad trucks are narrower than the Russians. So when you came to the border between Poland — Poland and Russia, they had to change the wheels, or — or —

   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="952">
   A: — it took some time before — and they had technique — they — they had ways of doing it, and it was all pretty efficient. So they just change the whole wheel assembly. The same box, they lifted up, changed the wheels, and off we went toJanuary 24, 2015 Russia. So we knew that we are going to Russia, and where — wherever they stopped it for — for changing this wheels, that — that was the border.

  </p>
  <p id="961">
   Q: To get there.
  </p>
  <p id="962">
   A: First of all, when — when they took us to Brody, a lot of other people would be co-coming. So they were gathering this transport, they were arranging a hu — long transport, maybe of 40 carriages, or something like that, you know? A long transport. But there were only few from our place, and few from others, and I know these people because I met them later, in Canada.
  </p>
  <p id="963">
   Q: On the same transport?
  </p>
  <p id="964">

   A: So you are here until you end your life. That’s all. That — th-that was — they will always tell you that you are here to work, until you die. You could hear it from every guard, cause there were armed guards over there. It was like a — a military compound.
  </p>
  <p id="1170">
   Q: And so was it surrounded by a fence?
  </p>
  <p id="1171">
   A: No, there was no fence. The — the fence was natural habitat, you know, I’m — where could you go?
  </p>
  <p id="1172">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1173">
   A: Forest, and nothing. There was a river, a large river. Nobody could pass probably, unless he knew how to swim. But what — where — where could you go? On the other side of the river?
  </p>
  <p id="1174">
   Q: So —
  </p>
  <p id="1175">
   A: I—I did swim that river, and I — although, I was — yeah, I was only 13 years old, to begin with, and then 14.
  </p>
  <p id="1176">
   Q: Yeah. So — so, did they tell you what the work was? What was the work that everybody had to do?
  </p>
  <p id="1177">
   A: The work, mostly men and able women were assigned to cut timber. They were cutting timber, woom, you know, and then cutting these shorter pieces, about a yard long, three feet long. And somebody would put a cubical or something, you know,January 24, 2015 like three by three. And then they would tie it with a rope, and there — the guy responsible, supervisor — a ma — a Russian guy, would come and stamp these pieces. He had like a hammer, and he put a stamp on everyone. It was funny. Well, now it’s [indecipherable] but some people were — would cut the ends very tiny, you know, cut it off during the night, or something like that. And they said, well, this is what we did today. So he would stamp it again, but it was the same cubicle.
  </p>
  <p id="1178">
   Q: So, in other words, they cut out the —
  </p>
  <p id="1179">
   A: They were cheating, people were cheating the authorities, let’s say.
  </p>
  <p id="1180">
   Q: So that meant they — they’d cut the end that he had stamped.
  </p>
  <p id="1181">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1182">
   Q: And they cut the stamp off, and they left it as if it hadn't been, and then dwi — they used the same cubic feet of — of logs for the next day.
  </p>
  <p id="1183">
   A: Yeah. For the next day. But it wasn’t that — I mean that — it’s not that typical, really.
  </p>
  <p id="1184">
   Q: Yeah, not that often.
  </p>
  <p id="1185">
   A: Not that often, but it happened. I know that happened, because my brothers used to do it, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1186">
   Q: What kind of instruments did they use for cutting logs, for cutting the trees?
  </p>
  <p id="1187">
   A: Oh, hand saws.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1188">
   Q: Hand saws.
  </p>
  <p id="1189">
   A: Hand saws. A big saw about five feet long, with big teeth, and a handle at each end, and they would —
  </p>
  <p id="1190">
   Q: So all of this was, let’s say, from human energy, no machines at all.
  </p>
  <p id="1191">
   A: There were machines at a saw mill.
  </p>
  <p id="1192">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1193">
   A: Because what happened, they cut the wood, timber, and they put them in the river. And they would float those logs on the river —
  </p>
  <p id="1194">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1195">
   A: — to a place where they had saw mills.
  </p>
  <p id="1196">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1197">
   A: And there were machinery with hooks, metal hooks, that would constantly rotate like this, you know, big chains, maybe 12, 14 feet long. And they — this chain would go into the river. And there were men who were guiding the logs towards this machine.
  </p>
  <p id="1198">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1199">
   A: And the hooks came, brought the logs on the shore, and there were people who took the logs again, in human strength, human force, and cut them into shorterJanuary 24, 2015 pieces, and put them into these cubicles, and from then on, they would move them on trains, to paper —
  </p>
  <p id="1200">
   Q: Paper mills.
  </p>
  <p id="1201">
   A: Factories, or paper plants, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1202">
   Q: So what — what was the wood that was being cut, was it pine?
  </p>
  <p id="1203">
   A: Pine. Ba-Basically pine, yes. Yes, one like what’s growing out here in this —
  </p>
  <p id="1204">
   Q: And did you — you were so young, were you put to work as well?
  </p>
  <p id="1205">
   A: Until I was 14 years old, I was forced to go — I mean forced, I liked to go to school. But it was a very short time, you see, when — when we arrive there, in February, I went to school.
  </p>
  <p id="1206">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1207">
   A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years old, which, only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work. And this is what I did, cause I didn’t want to go to school there, so I started working when I was 14 years old.
  </p>
  <p id="1208">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="1209">
   A: I was —
  </p>
  <p id="1210">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1211">
   A: — allow — I was — how you — auth-authorized. I was authorized —January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1212">
   Q: Authorized.
  </p>
  <p id="1213">
   A: — to take up employment. But up to 14, no, you had to go to school and —
  </p>
  <p id="1214">
   Q: And so these — you said there was a school for the Russian kids? So —
  </p>
  <p id="1215">
   A: Yes, yes, in the regular school.
  </p>
  <p id="1216">
   Q: Okay, so in — in addition to the Ukrainians who had been deported, was there like a regular — were there regular Russians who weren’t prisoners of any kind, who
  </p>
  <p id="1217">
   A: That’s right, that’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="1218">
   Q: — who lived there.
  </p>
  <p id="1219">
   A: All settlements. People lived there for many, many years.
  </p>
  <p id="1220">
   Q: Okay, generations, or something.
  </p>
  <p id="1221">
   A: Yeah, maybe generations, but who knows?
  </p>
  <p id="1222">
   Q: Did — did some of them live in different kinds of quarters than the one you describe?
  </p>
  <p id="1223">
   A: No, the same — the same kind of quarters, except that people wou — to expand, you know, they built a little shed by the — that log cabin, or they built like an entrance, so that normally you would enter from — from outside, like —
  </p>
  <p id="1224">
   Q: Right. 101 January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1225">
   A: — even here, you know, I don’t have anything else. But you could build a little — little —
  </p>
  <p id="1226">
   Q: Pre-entrance.
  </p>
  <p id="1227">
   A: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1228">
   Q: Yeah, so —
  </p>
  <p id="1229">
   A: — entrance. So they were improving whatever they could do, or they just live the way it provided.
  </p>
  <p id="1230">
   Q: What about the camp administrators? Since they were the officials —
  </p>
  <p id="1231">
   A: Oh, they had beautiful — beautiful buildings.
  </p>
  <p id="1232">
   Q: Oh, did they?
  </p>
  <p id="1233">
   A: Yeah, they had beautiful buildings, large. I remember, because my father, who was a builder, he worked — they put him to work right away. And they di — they ha — the building that was there, was falling apart. So he almost rebuild it, and it was [indecipherable] like a mansion. Painted white, and everything you — sometimes you can see those, in the movies, big — big homes. So that’s where the commandant, or the — the — the main administrator lived.
  </p>
  <p id="1234">
   Q: And did they have families?
  </p>
  <p id="1235">
   A: They had families, yes, but they were armed, and they were just like a military personnel. January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1236">
   Q: Okay, so you were the prisoners, and they were the guards.
  </p>
  <p id="1237">
   A: We were prisoners, but we are not prisoners in th — in the sense that we couldn’t go out, or anything like that. But within that area, yeah, we could move freely.
  </p>
  <p id="1238">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1239">
   A: Freely. But there was nowhere to go. Nowhere to go, unless somebody wanted to risk, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="1240">
   Q: Well, going out in the winter, into the forest to cut trees, did people — were they given the kind of clothing that you would need, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="1241">
   A: No, no, no, whatever we brought with us —
  </p>
  <p id="1242">
   Q: That was it.
  </p>
  <p id="1243">
   A: — that’s what — that’s what they used. They wouldn’t — maybe later on, because then they — they — they started paying for — for your time that you worked in the forest. People were paid, so you could probably buy little better —
  </p>
  <p id="1244">
   Q: Was there a store there?
  </p>
  <p id="1245">
   A: There was one official store. There no privacy — there were no private enterprise, nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="1246">
   Q: Right. 103January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1247">
   A: But there was a store, and usually you could buy shoes, special — specially adapted for — for that cold. They were might — made out of fabric. Fabric with some cotton inside, or whatever was it, wool? Cotton wool?
  </p>
  <p id="1248">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1249">
   A: Yeah, cotton wool. I have pictures of those things here, you could see how they looked.
  </p>
  <p id="1250">
   Q: And what else would be in these — in these stores?
  </p>
  <p id="1251">
   A: Oh, they had lot of champagne.
  </p>
  <p id="1252">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="1253">
   A: Yeah, there’s — you enter into the store, so the — all the shelves were full of champagne bottles. And you could buy it, if you had money. But I don’t think — and they were selling bread, but bread was rationed. You were allowed, for instance, half a pound of bread, and you had coupons like. You had —
  </p>
  <p id="1254">
   Q: So they —
  </p>
  <p id="1255">
   A: — tender — tendered the coupon, and then get the bread for it, and pay for it. But, just give you an example. When I reached the age of 14 years old, I started working. And I was supplying a fuel to those steam boilers. You had to constantly feed steam boilers to produce steam, to operate the machines.
  </p>
  <p id="1256">
   Q: Okay.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1257">
   A: And I worked as one that was supplying the fuel to these large boilers.
  </p>
  <p id="1258">
   Q: And these — these were the machines that were —
  </p>
  <p id="1259">
   A: Taking the wood out, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1260">
   Q: Of the water.
  </p>
  <p id="1261">
   A: — no — and then they were also cutting, but at the saw mills, they have mechanical saws, big saws like this. So they were operated by steam. Every — every machine that was there, was operated by sa — by steam. No electricity, by steam.
  </p>
  <p id="1262">
   Q: Interesting.
  </p>
  <p id="1263">
   A: So there were big boilers, constant, and supply tubes. They had systems, you know, built pretty well. Organized, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1264">
   Q: Was it — was it — were you warm, as you were doing this? Was this a kind of a job that people would have wanted to have, because of the conditions, or is it a difficult job?
  </p>
  <p id="1265">
   A: No. No, no, no, you — you — you had no choice, you were — you were assigned.
  </p>
  <p id="1266">
   Q: I know.
  </p>
  <p id="1267">
   A: You — you are going to do this, and you this and this. You — you couldn’t —
  </p>
  <p id="1268">
   Q: I understand you couldn’t choose.
  </p>
  <p id="1269">
   A: You couldn’t choose.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1270">
   Q: My point — yeah, my question is that, was it a good job to have, in the conditions, or was it one that was too difficult and nobody wanted to do it?
  </p>
  <p id="1271">
   A: There was no other work available, only timber. Everything was timber. Cutting wood, cutting to smaller pieces, cleaning it, removing the branches. That’s was —
  </p>
  <p id="1272">
   Q: Was your work outside?
  </p>
  <p id="1273">
   A: Outside all the time.
  </p>
  <p id="1274">
   Q: Ah, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1275">
   A: Outside.
  </p>
  <p id="1276">
   Q: It was outside.
  </p>
  <p id="1277">
   A: They were cutting the trees, big, tall trees, cleaning them, then cutting shorter, putting them on like pallets, and —
  </p>
  <p id="1278">
   Q: And supplying the fuel to the steam boiler was also something that was done outside?
  </p>
  <p id="1279">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah —
  </p>
  <p id="1280">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1281">
   A: — outside, yes, outside there. We were — there were four of us that were responsible for supplying the fuel to the boilers, and we had a little carriage on four wheels, that were on tracks —
  </p>
  <p id="1282">
   Q: Okay.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1283">
   A: — regular tracks. Well, we had to push this to where the other people were cutting the — the wood to shorter pieces. We collect those ends, put them on the thing, and take it to the boiler area.
  </p>
  <p id="1284">
   Q: So was — so, it was the ends of the wood that was the fuel?
  </p>
  <p id="1285">
   A: Yeah, for these boilers.
  </p>
  <p id="1286">
   Q: For these boilers.
  </p>
  <p id="1287">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1288">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1289">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1290">
   Q: So th — it was the scrap wood that you were —
  </p>
  <p id="1291">
   A: Scrap wood.
  </p>
  <p id="1292">
   Q: Wood.
  </p>
  <p id="1293">
   A: Or whatever was there, because they were cutting certain lands, equal lands, but there were leftovers. So this leftover, we picked up, and haul it — haul it to — to the boiler area.
  </p>
  <p id="1294">
   Q: Okay. And so, in your own barracks, did you also have some of the scrap wood to heat your own barracks, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1295">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1296">
   Q: Yes.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1297">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1298">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1299">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1300">
   Q: Was it allowed, or was it —
  </p>
  <p id="1301">
   A: Was it a— sure, it was allowed, a plentiful.
  </p>
  <p id="1302">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1303">
   A: It— yeah, you could —
  </p>
  <p id="1304">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1305">
   A: Whatever you needed for the little stove —
  </p>
  <p id="1306">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1307">
   A: — you could have it, right, could have it.
  </p>
  <p id="1308">
   Q: Was there anything that, let’s say, of these materials, of what you found in the forest, that you couldn’t take? That wasn’t allowed to be used for your own purposes?
  </p>
  <p id="1309">
   A: No, no, there was nothing, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1310">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1311">
   A: Everything — well, I mean, I — I — I can’t imagine what — what really — what —
  </p>
  <p id="1312">
   Q: Well, sometime I’ve — I’ve heard of people who got in trouble because they were accused of taking hay that wasn’t supposed to be taken, or — and sometimes — 108January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1313">
   A: Well, yeah, maybe if there were those state farms —
  </p>
  <p id="1314">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1315">
   A: — of course, that’s — that’s right, you couldn’t do that. But there was another si — instance where we stole, ma — me and my sister, Stanislawa, younger sister, we — we were stealing cabbage, because there was a state farm nearby, and they had their large, I don’t know maybe a acre, or two acres of — they were growing regular cabbage, so we would steal the cabbage from that si — field. So — so — but —
  </p>
  <p id="1316">
   Q: And you didn’t get caught?
  </p>
  <p id="1317">
   A: We — we didn’t get caught, but we did it during a very bad weather. The storm was terrible, there was raining, and things like that. Nobody would be out at that time, but we were. We — we had some sacks, and put some heads of the cabbage into the sacks, brought it home at night. It was — Mother right away started cutting this — the head — the — the cabbage, into the sauerkraut, maybe, put in these small containers, and —
  </p>
  <p id="1318">
   Q: And you had at least some sauerkraut.
  </p>
  <p id="1319">
   A: And then we had sauerkraut, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1320">
   Q: Were you hungry in this place?
  </p>
  <p id="1321">
   A: Oh, many times, yes, many times were hungry, because food was short and the bread was strictly rationed. 109 January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1322">
   Q: What was it that you ate? What — what did — were you given to —
  </p>
  <p id="1323">
   A: Potato, and you — basically soup, made with fish. So they would, let’s say, cut the heads off of a fish, and the fish would go to some restaurants or something like that, and the heads, they would make soup with — with the heads. So, it was like a clam chowder.
  </p>
  <p id="1324">
   Q: A very particular kind of clam chowder.
  </p>
  <p id="1325">
   A: Yeah — no, but they were heads. Head fishes floating. And it was very popular, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1326">
   Q: Well, it sounds it — also it probably was somewhat healthy, you know, the — that as much as there was very little, fish is generally healthy.
  </p>
  <p id="1327">
   A: Well, yeah, no, but usually they always — there was some — some vegetable that they could use —
  </p>
  <p id="1328">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1329">
   A: — make soup. But, as I say basically, they were oh — community dining rooms.
  </p>
  <p id="1330">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1331">
   A: And there was a large dining room of tables, and everybody was allowed certain amount —
  </p>
  <p id="1332">
   Q: Of food.
  </p>
  <p id="1333">
   A: — food. 110 January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1334">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1335">
   A: So you go to this dining room —
  </p>
  <p id="1336">
   Q: And you get either —
  </p>
  <p id="1337">
   A: — for breakfast —
  </p>
  <p id="1338">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1339">
   A: — for lunch, and for dinner. And when I was working, I was paid four rubles, and five kopek — kopaig(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1340">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1341">
   A: Like five cents.
  </p>
  <p id="1342">
   Q: Was that a weekly wage?
  </p>
  <p id="1343">
   A: No, daily.
  </p>
  <p id="1344">
   Q: That was the daily wage.
  </p>
  <p id="1345">
   A: Four rubles, and five kopek — kopek. Each food was one ruble.
  </p>
  <p id="1346">
   Q: Each time you went to eat.
  </p>
  <p id="1347">
   A: Each time you want to eat at the dining, it was one ruble. So — and the — and the bread that ath — were assign, was one ruble and five kopek. So that was my daily wage. I — if I wanted to buy all the f — bread that I was allowed, then there was nothing left. But sometimes I didn’t buy, I only bought two portions of bread. So I 111 January 24, 2015 spent two rubles, and I had two rubles spared. So then I could do — do something else with this money.
  </p>
  <p id="1348">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1349">
   A: Now there’s —
  </p>
  <p id="1350">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1351">
   A: And that — that — that was day from day, day after day after day.
  </p>
  <p id="1352">
   Q: What happened with the older people? Did people continue to get sick?
  </p>
  <p id="1353">
   A: No, they continued to die. There were a lot of people there were dying. Lot of people dying, during the short time that we were there, I would say about 200 people died. And later on I got a better job because I decided to become a shepherd. So re — those local Russians who lived there for — for many years, they were born there and everything, they were free, right? So they had goats. Each family had one or two goats. So they needed a shepherd to — to tend to these goats. So myself and my mother, we decided, you know, to — to get that job, or take the job if nobody wanted it, or couldn’t, or whatever. So we — what I used to have a — a little wooden piece like this on a string, and I had two little pieces of wood, you know, like — like the orchestra guy has, you know what that —

And when there was about 350 - 400 of them gathered together, then I took them to the pasture. And I took care of them during the day, and they were just feeding on — on the grass.

   Q: Right. So you would just mind them.
  </p>

   Q: It’s terrible work, yeah. I mean, you can — you can get sick very quickly from this.
  </p>
  <p id="1391">
   A: Well sure, of course, that’s why a lot of people lost health. Lot of people suffered later, the — you know, later in the life.
  </p>
  <p id="1392">
   Q: From all of these conditions.
  </p>
  <p id="1393">
   A: Having — God thank — thank God that it didn’t last too long, because in 1942, we were freed. We were allowed to — to leave Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="1394">
   Q: Well, I'll come to that, but before I do, I wanted to ask something about the relations between people — not the pe — not the prisoners and the administration —
  </p>

  <p id="1396">
   Q: — but between one another. Did people get — did you make friends there? Were people communitic — communicative? Did they share their experiences?
  </p>
  <p id="1397">
   A: Yes, they shared, but there was no community life. Impossible, you know, everybody was just work and sleep in the log. Everybody — there were no social life, let’s say.

  </p>
  <p id="1407">
   A: No, they were just — I don’t know, indifferent really. I mean, they — they suffered, but it was so common, every family would lose somebody. Every family that I know of, lost somebody. Or the father died, or mother died, or some of their siblings. Every family lost. So there was people — well, I [indecipherable] problem, and just very different, and they didn’t despair, they didn’t [indecipherable]. They were — of course they suffered emotionally. But nobody cared. Nobody cared. 117 January 24, 2015 Officially, the Russians that were, let’s say, in charge of that area, they didn’t care. You know, they were — openly said, you are here to — to — to die.

  <p id="1413">
   A: Podokneish(ph). You can look it up in a dictionary.
  </p>
  <p id="1414">
   Q: So let’s come —
  </p>
  <p id="1415">
   A: Ah terrible, ah yeah, terrible. And maybe I should also mention that where we lived, there were some Russians that were there before us, and I — they were from 1934 when — when Stalin deliberately starved a lot of people, or send them to Siberia. But on the other side of the river, there were just a re — remains of an old buildings. Nobody lived there, but it was quite a large area maybe, I don’t know, like few blocks of our, maybe five, 10 blocks, completely empty, only ruins. And mostly what — what was standing were chimneys, because they were made of brick, and the fireplaces. Because in that old time, there were just fireplaces, and not like gas cookers, or anything like that. Just a box with a — with room for — for coal orJanuary 24, 2015 wood, and a metal plate on top, where you could boil something. So only those things remained. And I used to go there, and looking for various things, and never found anything. But the ruins were there, large area.
  </p>
  <p id="1416">
   Q: And do you know — did you ever find out what they were ruins of?
  </p>
  <p id="1417">
   A: They — yeah, they were the people from way behi — way before. I mean, way several years. Let’s say °35, and this was *40, so not — not that mu — long, you know, not that long.
  </p>
  <p id="1418">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1419">
   A: So, this — what do you call it? These — this whole area was completely dead, empty, because they say that some kind of disease fell over there. And just —
  </p>
  <p id="1420">
   Q: Wiped everybody out?
  </p>
  <p id="1421">
   A: — wiped everybody, right. So they — whoever was left, was moved to the other side of the river, and that’s the — the new one, new area where we were —
  </p>
  <p id="1422">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1423">
   A: — placed.
  </p>
  <p id="1424">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1425">
   A: But that’s only regarding this place where I was, Shenchuga.

  <p id="1426">
   Q: Shenchuga.
  </p>
  <p id="1427">
   A: Shenchuga. 119 January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1428">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1429">
   A: And the larger place was Poduga. There was a hospital there, and —
  </p>
  <p id="1430">
   Q: And all of it abandoned. And all of it was abandoned.
  </p>
  <p id="1431">
   A: It wasn’t this part — yeah, this area was abandoned completely. Only ruins were there.
  </p>
  <p id="1432">
   Q: So tell us what happened in 1942. You said — you were mentioning that you were allowed to be — to leave in 1942. What happened?
  </p>
  <p id="1433">
   A: When — when the Germany attacked Russia —
  </p>
  <p id="1434">
   Q: That’s in June 1941.
  </p>
  <p id="1435">
   A: June 22", 1941, we suddenly became allies with Russia, because Poland had the government in England.
  </p>
  <p id="1436">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1437">
   A: There was a government in exile. And we were allied with France, England, and some — Ireland, something like that. So we suddenly, since the Germans attacked Russia, we became ally —
  </p>
  <p id="1438">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1439">
   A: — with the ru — with Russians. So the Russian says, now you are free, you’re free. You can go a will — anywhere you go — anywhere you want.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1440">
   Q: Well, 1-if you say that you found out in ’42, it took half a year for you to find out. I mean, from June ’41, di— the news didn’t travel too fast.
  </p>
  <p id="1441">
   A: No, it’s fa — it traveled very fast.
  </p>
  <p id="1442">
   Q: Oh, it did?
  </p>
  <p id="1443">
   A: Except nobody took any action. We knew that Germany is at war with Russia, we knew that. And the Russian told us right away. It happened in June, but in — in si — August — in August, the Polish government in exile already had an agreement with the Russian government.
  </p>
  <p id="1444">
   Q: How did this affect you in Shenchuga, in those months?
  </p>
  <p id="1445">
   A: Well, they said, you are free, you can leave, you can go away if you want.
  </p>
  <p id="1446">
   Q: Right away they said that?
  </p>
  <p id="1447">
   A: Right — well, two months later, maybe.
  </p>
  <p id="1448">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1449">
   A: Two months.
  </p>
  <p id="1450">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1451">
   A: I can — yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1452">
   Q: So, no longer were —
  </p>
  <p id="1453">
   A: Because it was in — in — in August that we were actually told that we can — oh, and they give us papers.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1454">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1455">
   A: And — certificates that we can travel anywhere we want, because before, we couldn’t leave the area. But then we — everybody got the certificate, like a travel document or something like that, and people would leave. Some left right away, but we stayed there until June — no, June? No, no, January. Until January ’42. On the new year, the first of January, ’42, my family finally decided to leave Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="1456">
   Q: And why did it take that extra number of months to make this decision?
  </p>
  <p id="1457">
   A: Because they didn’t know what to do, they didn’t know where to go. You couldn’t go back to Poland, because Germans overrun Poland, you know, they were at war with Russia. So — and where were — people were asking, what are we going to do? Said well, maybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And there — then, most of them did go south. But that was later.
  </p>
  <p id="1458">
   Q: And did you still continue working under the same conditions after you were told, or d— were you given more rations, or were you — did your — did your everyday rhythm of life change, when you were told in August —
  </p>
  <p id="1459">
   A: Well, it was only from a psychological point of view that we are free. But av — everything just went the same way.
  </p>
  <p id="1460">
   Q: Stayed the same.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1461">
   A: Whoever — yes, whoever worked in the forest, you know, they worked in the forest, but they were treated differently. They were free citizens. We were free. So we had something to say, and we had some rights, let’s say, at that time. Because we already had the Polish government in England, who was looking after our interests. So they were talking to the Russian government, and the Russian — Russian allowed more freedom, and better — better conditions and better pay, and everything else. They started treating us differently.
  </p>
  <p id="1462">
   Q: So their behavior was different.
  </p>
  <p id="1463">
   A: Absolutely, right. They changed. And like I say, me — a lot of people left earlier. Like my brother Frank, the second from the top, he left in August.
  </p>
  <p id="1464">
   Q: Right away.
  </p>
  <p id="1465">
   A: He left right away. Went to south, Uzbekistan, and we decided, I don’t know why, but my mother and my father were not ready, or didn’t know what to do. So we stayed until the first of January, °42.
  </p>
  <p id="1466">
   Q: Okay. Your brother Jusef(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1467">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1468">
   Q: Was he deported with you?
  </p>
  <p id="1469">
   A: No. It was entirely different story, as I say. He was running that newspaper in Rowna, and when the r — Russian — Soviet — Soviet Union came into Poland, they 123 January 24, 2015 arrested him right away, and we never heard from him, until 19 — long, long — 40 — wait a minute? Forty-three? Forty-four? Maybe we didn’t hear from him at all, we didn’t know what happened to him. But now I know that he was arrested and sent to the — the — Kolyma. Have you heard of Ko-Kolyma’?
  </p>
  <p id="1470">
   Q: Oh yeah, Kolyma.
  </p>
  <p id="1471">
   A: He was at Ko-Kolyma, working in the coal mines.
  </p>
  <p id="1472">
   Q: I see. I see. And Roman?
  </p>
  <p id="1473">
   A: Roman was with us.
  </p>
  <p id="1474">

  </p>
  <p id="1478">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1479">
   A: So we left together.
  </p>
  <p id="1480">
   Q: You all left together, except for Franciczek(ph) [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1481">
   A: Only Frank left sooner.
  </p>
  <p id="1482">
   Q: And he left becau — did he want to join the Polish army? Was this hi — his reason? January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1483">
   A: Yes, exactly right. Exactly right, we — we didn’t — we ne — found out that there is a Polish army being organized in the south of Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="1484">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1485">
   A: And that’s where we — most of the people decided to leave Russia, go south. And after we reached Uzbekistan, the army sort of extended their protection of Russia, and they took care of us, and [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1486">
   Q: So how did you leave? Before we get to that point, how did you leave that Shenchuga? Was it — it wa — was it by sleigh again, or was it on foot, was it with a wagon? How did you leave?
  </p>
  <p id="1487">
   A: No, from — from the Shenchuga to the railway station, we were by sleigh.
  </p>
  <p id="1488">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1489">
   A: Sleigh. We hired it [indecipherable] or whatever. The Russians provided the transportation.
  </p>
  <p id="1490">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1491">
   A: And then they also allowed us to use regular passenger trains, at that time, passenger trains.
  </p>
  <p id="1492">
   Q: Not cattle cars?
  </p>
  <p id="1493">
   A: No, that’s right, and — and we didn’t have to pay for the journey.
  </p>
  <p id="1494">
   Q: Okay.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1495">
   A: So — but —
  </p>
  <p id="1496">
   Q: And you went by train to Uzbekistan?
  </p>
  <p id="1497">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1498">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1499">
   A: Yes, to Uzbekistan.
  </p>
  <p id="1500">
   Q: And then what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="1501">
   A: And from Uzbekistan, we were moved to Persia. Iran.
  </p>
  <p id="1502">
   Q: In what way, also by train?
  </p>
  <p id="1503">
   A: Oh yes, they — it was by train. From then on, everything was by train.
  </p>
  <p id="1504">
   Q: Okay.

   A: Or — or no — part of it was just a freight train again.
  </p>
  <p id="1506">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1507">
   A: But under free conditions, you know, the better conditions and it didn’t last that long, because it was fast, you know, they didn’t put us on the side or anything, didn’t have to wait. It was just from here to there, from — from Gouza(ph), or Jakobak(ph), there were to places on the south. We went to Caspian Sea, Krasnovodsk —
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="1511">
   A: It — there wasn’t much problem, because when we reached Uzbekistan in February — it took two months to get from north to — to the south. That I remember, two months, by various means, basically freight train. So when they — when we came to Uzbekistan, Polish authorities, which were already trying to help this civilian population, say that we are going to move you away from Russia, into Persia. So, it was a very short period of time, only two weeks when — when my mother and sister and I was assigned to leave Russia, in March.
  </p>
  <p id="1512">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1513">
   A: And since we came by the end of February, so only a few weeks. And we were already, as far as I’m concerned, ready to leave, and I fell sick with typhus. Typhoid fever. So they couldn’t — they didn’t allow me, because the transport was ready to — to leave Russia, to Persia, and a— we were assigned to this transport, but because of my sickness, I was retained there. Authority says no, you cannot travel, because you'll spread —

  <p id="1514">
   Q: Typhoid, mm-hm.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1515">
   A: — typhoid to other people. So they took me to a hospital, and my mother said, I am staying with you, I am staying with you. I am staying I’m — until you get well, and we’ll see what happens. But my brother Roman, he was already in administrative position, he was trying to help all these civilian people get relocated, or taken care of, he says — he said, Mother, you leave with my sister, you go, and go to Persia, and I will take care of Tony. Or me. So don’t worry about him, he will be all right.
  </p>
  <p id="1516">
   Q: And what about your father?
  </p>
  <p id="1517">
   A: Oh, my father died in Russia, we didn’t say anything about that.
  </p>
  <p id="1518">
   Q: No, let’s talk about that. But first tell me about this, let’s finish this, then — you — so you — did you — is that what happened, that your brother Roman stayed with you?
  </p>
  <p id="1519">
   A: Yes, yes. And he says that he told Mother to go, that we — we will follow later on, because at that time it was this time on a lot of people were leaving, Polish people were leaving Russia under General Anders. I don’t know whether it’s familiar to you. He was in charge of the Polish army, which was being organized in the south of Russia. He was in charge of everything, civilians, and the military.
  </p>
  <p id="1520">
   Q: Okay. 128January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1521">
   A: So from then on we — we were really taken care of, because British were already helping to take care of the Pole — civilians.
  </p>
  <p id="1522">
   Q: Okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1523">
   A: Yes. So Mother and Sister left for Persia in March, and I stayed behind —
  </p>
  <p id="1524">
   Q: With Roman.
  </p>
  <p id="1525">
   A: — and took me to a hospital, and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital. And when I got well, I was released from the hospital and joined a Polish young soldiers. It was no — a sel — special unit being organized for the young people, say from 14 to 17.
  </p>
  <p id="1526">
   Q: And you were then about how old?
  </p>
  <p id="1527">
   A: I was 14 years, 15.
  </p>
  <p id="1528">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1529">
   A: Going on 15. So I was accepted to this Polish young army.
  </p>
  <p id="1530">
   Q: And — and your brother —
  </p>
  <p id="1531">
   A: — ko — like a cadet.
  </p>
  <p id="1532">
   Q: I see. And Franciczek(ph) had already joined the army? Your — the first brother, who left, already joined the army.
  </p>
  <p id="1533">
   A: He — yes, he was already south, he was safe.
  </p>
  <p id="1534">
   Q: Okay. 129January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1535">
   A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left Russia early. And my mother and sister also left in March, while I stayed behind until August.
  </p>
  <p id="1536">
   Q: Oh, that’s quite a while then.
  </p>
  <p id="1537">
   A: Yes, quite a while, because then they stopped the transpor — transports. I don’t know whose decision it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march — exodus I call it, let’s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left Russia. But in August they resumed leaving —
  </p>
  <p id="1538">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1539">
   A: — because General Anders was then in charge of the army and everybody that was there, and he negotiated with the Russian people, with the Russian authorities. So, in August they resumed, and they moved about hundred thousand people at that time.
  </p>
  <p id="1540">
   Q: Huge number.
  </p>
  <p id="1541">
   A: Huge number, but it was all concentrated. August — and mainly August, yeah, a lot of people left.
  </p>
  <p id="1542">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="1543">
   A: And then when — I also left Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="1544">
   Q: What about Roman?
  </p>
  <p id="1545">
   A: Roman, yes —January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1546">
   Q: Also left at the same time?
  </p>
  <p id="1547">
   A: — yes, right, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1548">
   Q: So let’s go back now, and talk about what happened to your father. The last you mentioned is he rebuilt this beautiful house.
  </p>
  <p id="1549">
   A: Yes, for the administrator there, the main them —
  </p>
  <p id="1550">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1551">
   A: — boss of that area. And then he started getting sick. And on — on the first, like I mentioned, on the first of January, we le — we decided to leave. And he was already very sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17" day of the journey, he passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm, a place near Ural mountains. He — he died, and I — I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and he was saying goodbye, and you know, that — and he just gave up. And we left him on a platform, because when the train sto — I said, Mother — it was about one o’clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time — the first thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know. They took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are tracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were already about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My — Roman, because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the 131January 24, 2015 railroad platform, without — without funeral. We — we tried to get some kind of arrangement, but 1t was impossible, you know, there — it’s impossible, just leave here, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put some wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it’s — that was the Perm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru — you know, communication, rails. That — that was the main — main system of moving around, either freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare.
  </p>
  <p id="1552">
   Q: Was — you said he was saying goodbye to everybody in — as you were talking to him?
  </p>
  <p id="1553">
   A: No, he was — we were — I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he gave up, then I — I woke my mother.
  </p>
  <p id="1554">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1555">
   A: I didn’t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn’t know that.
  </p>
  <p id="1556">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1557">
   A: But it happened during the night, and I — I knew when it happens, and then I woke my mother, and — and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put him on the platform, and — and he was left there, with others. But the death was the normal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can understand that. We were treated — I can’t even say. Worse than animals, by theJanuary 24, 2015 Russians. They didn’t care. Because it — that was Stalin’s policy. You are here until you die, but in our case, we were — I mean, blessed that it — that we did get out of that hell. It was pure hell. People don’t realize like — you know, no — no clinic, no doctor, no help. No, it — they — they didn’t care. We die here or there, today, tomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was to get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin’s policy, you know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="1558">
   Q: Like you said, everybody left —
  </p>
  <p id="1559">
   A: I—I don’t know, I don’t know. I don’t know how to continue, because this 1s — this is the worst. Worst moment of the life.
  </p>
  <p id="1560">
   Q: Do you want us to stop for a little bit?
  </p>
  <p id="1561">
   A: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe a little, how about —
  </p>
  <p id="1562">
   Q: Okay, we can — we can —
  </p>
  <p id="1563">
   A: — getting some water, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1564">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1565">
   A: — soda.
  </p>
  <p id="1566">
   Q: Sure. [break]January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1567">
   A: — the Germans were — were leading some prisoners along the road, from one place to another because they were, let’s say, taken to do — do some work somewhere. Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home, and there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw potato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started —
  </p>
  <p id="1568">
   Q: To eat it.
  </p>
  <p id="1569">
   A: — eating a si— a raw potato. But the German pri — g-guard, when saw it, he shot him. And he was still eating when he was —
  </p>
  <p id="1570">
   Q: Falling.
  </p>
  <p id="1571">
   A: — falling, he was still eating that bre — that —
  </p>
  <p id="1572">
   Q: Raw potato.
  </p>
  <p id="1573">
   A: Who — who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another? Why — why — why did we have this concentration camp? Why they’re so — you know, mean to each other? Why?
  </p>
  <p id="1574">
   Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself?
  </p>
  <p id="1575">
   A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being, that they have soul, and responsibility. We — we are not vegetable. We are people with feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don’t know, some people don’t believe that, but I — I believe. I— I’m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how 134January 24, 2015 another human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I — I don’t know. I’ve seen a lot in my life.
  </p>
  <p id="1576">
   Q: Did you — did you ever question while — when you were there, did you ever question your belief? Did you ever think there — there can be no God, because a — what I’m seeing is so terrible?
  </p>
  <p id="1577">
   A: No, this — then the — no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you know, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how — maybe there isn’t. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human being, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav — savages to another people, went free. I — I cannot imagine that. So I think that there is — there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one way or the other. But maybe there isn’t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know, this is probably not for social discussion.
  </p>
  <p id="1578">
   Q: Well, actually, these are the key questions.
  </p>
  <p id="1579">
   A: Question.
  </p>
  <p id="1580">
   Q: Sometimes — the-these are the key ones.
  </p>
  <p id="1581">
   A: Question that I have chance to raise with you, for instance, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1582">
   Q: Well, I’m glad.
  </p>
  <p id="1583">
   A: But we discuss these things, we’re friends, I mean, you know.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1584">
   Q: Yeah. You know, these are the sort of — like, these things that happened, and the people went through, they go to the basic questions of living, and of life. And the questions that you’re raising, are the kind that we wish we could find answers for.
  </p>
  <p id="1585">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1586">
   Q: We wish we could know.
  </p>
  <p id="1587">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1588">
   Q: Because how else do you — how do you explain such cruelty? How do you explain such things?
  </p>
  <p id="1589">
   A: Sure, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1590">
   Q: You know?
  </p>
  <p id="1591">
   A: Yeah. Well, I—I talked about it a lot, because my — my daughter is married to a American — not native American, but an American of so many, many years, let’s say. So they — they often want to hear something of what I have to tell them, and sometimes, you know, I wonder if they ever get th-the real feeling what I have to —
  </p>
  <p id="1592">
   Q: Share.
  </p>
  <p id="1593">
   A: — share, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1594">
   Q: Yeah. It’s very hard for — for people in societies that haven’t experienced something similar — individual people will be able to understand it, but the societyJanuary 24, 2015 didn’t go through something like that, so it’s unfamiliar for them. They haven’t — they haven’t gone through the same kind of historical trauma.
  </p>
  <p id="1595">
   A: No, no, no, of course not.
  </p>
  <p id="1596">
   Q: Yeah. But some do, and very well, and very deeply. Let’s continue, and talk about your exodus. When you leave from Krasnovodsk —
  </p>
  <p id="1597">
   A: Krasnovodsk.
  </p>
  <p id="1598">
   Q: — vodsk, and over the Caspian Sea.
  </p>
  <p id="1599">
   A: Sea.
  </p>
  <p id="1600">
   Q: Tell me, what — what was that like? Was — were you on a boat? Were you on a — a little one, a big one? What di — what did it look like?
  </p>
  <p id="1601">
   A: No, it — the journey was done on a oil tanker. There were —
  </p>
  <p id="1602">
   Q: On an oil tanker, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1603">
   A: — oil tankers, because they were out of those ships in that area. So they just put us on — on top, on — on the deck. It was all metal, and if you can imagine August sun beating in that area, which is south, real close to the meridian.
  </p>
  <p id="1604">
   Q: Right, me —
  </p>
  <p id="1605">
   A: It was hot, and the metal deck was really, you know, very, very hot.
  </p>
  <p id="1606">
   Q: So, could you cook an egg on it?January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1607">
   A: I guess, yeah. Maybe — hey, people said that they would — and a lot — and lack of water, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these little canteens, so filled with water, maybe say a quart of water in there, and it — it — journey took three year — three days. So, that water didn’t last long, and there was no water to get on the ship.
  </p>
  <p id="1608">
   Q: Oh, wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1609">
   A: So it was real — that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards freedom, we are leaving Russia, so everything was —
  </p>
  <p id="1610">
   Q: You — you bore it —
  </p>
  <p id="1611">
   A: — bearable.
  </p>
  <p id="1612">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1613">
   A: We — we were glad to. And after we disembarked in Pahlevi — Pahlavi, in Persia, well, people were just kneeling on the sand, after we got off the tra — off the ships in the port, and marched towards the transit area, where there were tents, large tents where we could, you know, relax, and — and one thing, there was one tent where the — everybody had to go through that. We strip — stripped everything down, left. Showers. New, fresh clothes at the other end of the tent, out into the freedom. That was like heaven.
  </p>
  <p id="1614">
   Q: Was it? Was it? 138 January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1615">
   A: Yeah. You entered one, leave everything behind, and out the other side. That was — yeah. Beautiful moment. That’s when we left Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="1616">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1617">
   A: After —
  </p>
  <p id="1618">
   Q: So when you said people were kneeling, were they — were — were they —
  </p>
  <p id="1619">
   A: Praying.
  </p>
  <p id="1620">
   Q: Praying.
  </p>
  <p id="1621">
   A: Praying and thanking God for — because we knew that everything was in past.
  </p>
  <p id="1622">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1623">
   A: That — because the British were taking care of us then.
  </p>
  <p id="1624">
   Q: So what happened to you after you went the other side of the tent, and you got a new set of clothes?
  </p>
  <p id="1625">
   A: New set of clothes, and I joined the — the si — they call them young people. It was just like a cadet level, you know, that area. And they gave us uniforms. They were like semi-military uniforms, and they drafted us into this — these schools.
  </p>
  <p id="1626">
   Q: So you were 15 and a half?
  </p>
  <p id="1627">
   A: Yeah, that’s about right, yes. Well —
  </p>
  <p id="1628">
   Q: Sixteen?

  <p id="1632">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1633">
   A: Yeah.

  <p id="1634">
   Q: So, two and a half years after you’re deported, you’re in Iran.
  </p>
  <p id="1635">

   Q: You’re in Persia.

  </p>
  <p id="1638">
   Q: And so you started going to — did you see your si — did you make connection with your sister and your mother?
  </p>
  <p id="1639">
   A: Unfortunately no, because they were always ahead of me. When I came to — to Persia, I found out that they left for Africa two weeks —
  </p>
  <p id="1640">
   Q: Before.
  </p>
  <p id="1641">
   A: — before we arrived there.
  </p>
  <p id="1642">
   Q: What did Roman do? Did he join the milit —

   A: Roman saw them. Because like si — I said, he was in administrative position, so he was taking care of these movements and how the transports were coming in, so he would register them, and say you go here, you go here, you know. So he had 140 January 24, 2015 possibility to — to meet a lot of people, and he saw Mother and — and — and daughter — and — Mother and Sister.

  </p>
  <p id="1653">
   A: I call it a cadet, but maybe it’s not the right way, because cadet is a little higher. But it was young, Polish soldiers, they called them.
  </p>
  <p id="1654">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1655">
   A: Young Polish soldier, or boys’ training school.

  </p>
  <p id="1662">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1663">
   A: Both. Parallel, you know. Morning, learning geography, history, math, etcetera, in temporary classes. There were no, like schools, but there were some kind of areas where we would gather, and there were professor, or teachers. And we had notes, you know, notebooks, to take notes. And we were learning, learning all the time. And then, further up, as we moved away from Russia to Persia, and from Palestine, then we started getting regular education, in regular surrounding, in nice classes, brick buildings, and — and it’s — just went up. Up and up, up.

  </p>
  <p id="1671">
   A: Forty-seven, exactly, until the end of ’47, when we were evacuated from Middle East, to England.
  </p>
  <p id="1672">
   Q: And why were you evacuated from the Middle East to England?
  </p>
  <p id="1673">
   A: Because war ended, and there was nowhere — no — no more si — army, no more units. Everybody was a civilian.
  </p>
  <p id="1674">
   Q: So it wasn’t some event in the Middle East that made you leave, that re-re — caused the evacuation.
  </p>
  <p id="1675">
   A: No, no, but in the Middle East, we were under the British command.

   Q: I had asked you earlier, had you ever seen a German soldier, and you said not then, not in the beginning when — when we were in your village, you know, near Tarnopol. But, at some point, did you see —
  </p>
  <p id="1679">
   A: Yes, at some point in Egypt, when I saw — maybe it wasn’t — he was a prisoner of war, because me — a lot of Germans were taken prisoners, you know, in theJanuary 24, 2015 Allemagne campa — Alleman — Allemagne campaign, and Montgomery was fighting, you know, in Africa.
  </p>
  <p id="1680">

  <p id="1747">
   A: Oh yeah, it was — I actually greeted my mother when she was brought from — from the port to the camp. There were civilian camps. Camps for the civilian population who was either in Africa or in India, they were all coming to England. England decided to —

  <p id="1748">
   Q: Bring them [indecipherable]

   A: And then after they — one more thing, when I — when they took me to the hospital and I lost consciousness or — for two weeks I didn’t know what — what was going on. And after I regained consciousness, I started looking in my ba — military pack, you know, backpack, and I found a piece of paper. You know, some official — official piece of paper. And I looked at it, and it looked like a telegram. So I looked at it closer. It wasn’t for me, it was addressed it to my brother Joseph.
  </p>
  <p id="1758">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="1759">
   A: Yes, and somebody, the military mail got screwed up, and they deliver it to me, while was in the hospital in Russia. And after looking at this, I say what — what is this? So I started asking, I say yeah, this unit is about five miles from here. So —

   A: There is a picture of her.
  </p>
  <p id="1856">
   Q: A picture. Beautiful. Is there anything else you’d like to add to what we’ve spoken about today? Anything you would want your grandchildren, and other people’s grandchildren to understand about what you went through, what you experienced?
  </p>
  <p id="1857">
   A: Well, I— I must say that my two granddaughters, lovely two granddaughters, they are very intelligent, and — and they — ever since they were small children, when I was talking about my experiences, let’s say to — to my son-in-law’s family, he has a family in Minnesota, my son-in-law. So they were always interested in hearing my stories, just like now. Maybe not to the full extent —
  </p>
  <p id="1858">
   Q: Yeah. January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1859">
   A: — like now. So, as the — the — the little girls, they were playing somewhere, you know, etcetera. Then suddenly, they were asking me questions. Says, how do you know? Oh, I — I listen to you. Yes, and they are one in Chicago, and one other is in Minneapolis. Both very bright young ladies.
  </p>
  <p id="1860">
   Q: And do they understand? Do you feel that they understand?
  </p>
  <p id="1861">
   A: Yeah, I — I feel that they understand, yes. They understand, and I say — I was surprised, you know, how they ne — heard almost — I mean, they were never in the same, say company, they were playing somewhere —
  </p>
  <p id="1862">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1863">
   A: —1n the same room, though. But she remembered, especially the — the younger one, they say, oh Dziadziu — dziadziu means grandpa, yes, I remember how you were talking, you know, about your experiences, and — and they were interested, and still are, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1864">
   Q: Here’s ano — here’s a question I don’t often ask, but what would you want the young people of their generation, who live in Russia, to understand about what you went through? Because they won’t hear about it yet from history books. They may at some point.January 24, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1865">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1866">
   Q: But what would you want them to understand about this experience, these years that you spent there?
  </p>
  <p id="1867">
   A: I don’t expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how fragile is the human character, or something, that you know, people can change from being very nice, to being really like an animal to one another. Which I think you have to be conscious of it and be careful, because you never know what these people are capable of doing to one another. This is, unfortunately, my experience. And I — I hope that this will never happen to anybody, the way it happened to me. But they should be aware of the human frailty, or human — I don’t know what it — what it is really — that is capable of changing the character of a — of a person.
  </p>
  <p id="1868">
   Q: That we have it in us, and even if we don’t know we do.
  </p>
  <p id="1869">
   A: I do not understand. I do not understand how can people be so mean to each other. They can be a friend and they so mean.
  </p>
  <p id="1870">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1871">
   A: It — it’s — to me, it’s against the human nature. People should be friendly to each other, helpful. Extend your hand, if you can. Don’t — don’t push away the extended hand, or be friendly. There — there is no friendliness among people. And that —January 24, 2015 that’s very disappointing. Very disappointing. I— even now I says, why do people fight each o-other, all over?
  </p>
  <p id="1872">
   Q: And these are the things —
