They were living in little houses, they were living in one or the other. So my father started working for the transport unloading box cars, and I was playing soccer then.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: You were playing soccer in the camp?
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: In Theresienstadt. It was not a camp, it was a kibbutz.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: In the ghetto?
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: And I had to work, too. I had to work to put cars -- I can't remember what kind of work I did. Little work, kitchen work I did do. Gardening I did a little bit. But mostly I play soccer. With the soccer, I played soccer. So I was a little bit better --
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: You were more athletic?
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: I was athletic a little bit, yeah, and I had a little bit --
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: You had played soccer as a child —
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="208">
   Q: -- before that? I see. Okay. So then -- then things went on until what was the next --
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: September '44. Before September they start getting transport together. We didn't know where they go. They send us out of Theresienstadt. And we came on in September '44 and I think was Yom Kippur even that day, Yom Kippur arrived, maybe, I don't know. Anyway, we were put on box cars and sent to Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: There was a large group of people?
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   A: The whole train. I don't know how many people there were on them, but it was a whole train were sent to Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: How was your health at this point?
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: I was young. I was healthy. I was strong. So was my father, too. But the thing when we got out there, you know, Auschwitz, he wore glasses. I didn't wear no glasses then, and had a beard from the train ride and he looked tired. And Mr. Mengele was standing there at the train, we had to go in lines, and Dr. Mengele, left and right. My father went to the right, I went to the left. And I said, "This is my father. I want to go with him." This man, he had a whip and he whipped me with my bag and I was running to the left. So from that date on, that was the end of my father. I never saw my father again. And I found out there was a fire, I think it was a fire, yeah, smokestacks. And I said, "What is it?" Somebody told me that's -- they burn the bricks, until I find out -- it was really messy and stinky, you know. So what it was, it was the crematorium.
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: When you were taking the train to there from Theresienstadt, were these cattle cars?
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: That was cattle cars, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: Yeah. How long did it take you to get there?
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: I think it was three or four days. I don't remember.
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Did you get any food during that time?
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: We had still food on us. But the worst part was I was voluntary -- they was looking for people, I never got the tut (ph). I was only stamped like an animal. And I was voluntary to Buchenwald. I said to myself I wanted to get out of hell, because what was going on there, I can't even say all that. I said go away from here. I want to get out, just out of here. So when a group of Viennese people, about 50, we got voluntary to Buchenwald. But we never came to Buchenwald, we came to Kaufering.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: Well, now, wait a minute. You left Theresienstadt and went to --
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Auschwitz, okay. We will get to the later part in a minute. And I was asking you about the ride from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, and you said it took three --
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Three, four days. I don't remember exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Yeah. And that particular trip, again, was the feeling of the people -- did they have any idea where they were going?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: We didn't know where we were going, no, I said this. We didn't know. We had no idea.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Did they let you get out at all?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: No. No way.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: What were the sensations in the car? Was there any light?
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: No. There was no light in there. Cattle bar -- cars.
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: Could you lie down at all?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: We were sitting down. There were about 50 people in there.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Was it all men?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: I don't remember. I think we were all men. No, no, we were mixed. From Auschwitz away we were all men.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: And then you got to Auschwitz and you said you were separated from your father and that was the last time you saw him. And then where did you -- where did you go in Auschwitz? Where did you --
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: I went to the (unintelligible). I got clean in and I got dirty out. My hair was shaved and they took all the clothes away, everything I had they took away and gave me the striped uniforms. And then we were sent to one of those mogs (ph). And we were sitting, I don't know, a week. And they asked for volunteers for Buchenwald. So I said let's go to Buchenwald. And then when we left there, 1t was September 2, and we left and went over in cattle cars again.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: Okay. How many -- how many people went with you?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: There were about 50. In half a thing, half a box car only, because the other half were the SS in there.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: These were young people like you?
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: Mostly young men, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Young men volunteered to go to Buchenwald?
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: I didn't know everybody volunteered, but —
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: Well, you did.
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: Quite a lot volunteered to get out of -- out of Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="244">
   Q: Uh huh. Because you knew what was happening in Auschwitz?
  </p>
  <p id="245">
   A: I saw what was going on. We didn't get no food.
  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: They did not give you any food that week?
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: When they carried the food through the block, people coming out, they kill them, they shoot them. But they were going under with the food container and robbed the food container. So the most of them was in the underground. Before they come to the block, they had no food. But when we left there, they gave us a piece of bread. One loaf of bread, actually, not a piece, a loaf of bread, a piece of sausage and a piece of cheese.
  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: Each person?
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: Each person, right. Till I get to the box car I had no more bread, I had no more sausage, I had no more cheese. I eat everything up. Then we were four days in that box car to go to Auschwitz without food, without water.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: To go to --
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: Auschwitz -- Kaufering. That's a commando post from Dauchau. It was not far from Dauchau, camp number three, I was.

  </p>
  <p id="254">
   Q: And how did they treat you?
  </p>
  <p id="255">
   A: Well, they didn't say anything to us. They just said if one goes -- tries to escape --
  </p>
  <p id="256">
   Q: Escape?A: We shoot them all. And the train when we left Auschwitz went to ViennA: I could see from the top under a bridge where we passed on the train, I see the house where I used to live. And I tried with the barbed wire, and then he said if one goes away, everybody is dead. So I said forget it. I didn't do it. I don't want to go.
  </p>
  <p id="257">
   Q: Okay. And then you got to Kaufering. You got off the train?
  </p>
  <p id="258">
   A: Kaufering, yeah.

I had one shirt on for six months and that was my towel and everything. I slept in it at night and I worked in the -- at night -- for the first two weeks we were carrying cement bags from the box car to the cement mixer. That was going steady. Steady, steady for two weeks I did this. And I said to myself, if I keep on doing this, I won't live long. So I disappeared always. I got caught a few times.
  </p>
  <p id="261">
   Q: Where did you disappear to?
  </p>
  <p id="262">

And next to the Camp Allach was a German artillery, and the Americans were shooting in and the Germans were shooting back. And every American shell that went to shore came in the camp.

And he went inside, Mr. Niches, the oldest, camp oldest, got in and found it right away and he came out and (spoke in German) there is nothing inside.So we were lucky, otherwise we would be hanged. Because the camp hanged a lot of people in the camp, in Kaufering.
  </p>
  <p id="323">
   Q: Did you see people being hung?
  </p>
  <p id="324">
   A: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I saw people between the fence. They got caught stealing potatoes, they put potatoes in their mouth. You stayed between the two wires for many, many hours. When they didn't want to live anymore, they just touch the wire and they fell over. When anything you steal, they put you between the wires.
  </p>
  <p id="325">
   Q: Did you ever feel just like giving up?

  <p id="326">
   A: No. I had a will, will to live. I always had the will to live. I think I was strong. I was very strong. I saw so many people dying, dying like flies, but I never gave up. And I always washed myself. I dried myself in my shirt that was six months old. At night I put it under the blanket so it dries. And I was shivering, but still it dries for the next day to go to work. But I washed myself. The people -- the first two weeks when they were in Kaufering, they had the cement coming out of their ears, out of their nose, and it was like, like concrete. They couldn't get that off no more because they never washed.

  </p>
  <p id="332">
   A: Very bad. Very, very bad. The toilet was called the latrine, and there was just one two- by-four, four-by, something like that, and everybody was sitting on it next to each other.
  </p>
  <p id="333">
   Q: Um-hmm, um-hmm. And your health, you said --

  </p>
  <p id="336">
   A: Well, the war is over and we live. That's all. I want to live. I want to live. So we went to -- we took a car from Luftwaffe and we drove to Salzburg.
  </p>
  <p id="337">
   Q: How did you get the car?
  </p>
  <p id="338">
   A: It was standing in the street with the keys inside. It is a long story, too. But, anyway, we came to Salzburg.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   Q: And the two of you just got in the car?
  </p>
  <p id="340">
   A: Got in the car and we drove. And I was sick, I was very, very sick. I didn't know what I had. And we came to Salzburg and they took away the car from us, but when they opened the door I fell and I went unconscious. So they put me in a Lazarette, in a hospital, in a German hospital. They didn't know I was in -- because I didn't speak a word of English.
  </p>
  <p id="341">
   Q: Okay. You were 19 years old at this point?
  </p>
  <p id="342">
   A: Something like that. I didn't speak a word of English and I didn't even know what German means. I swear that's the truth. I said I am German, I am German. I want to say I am a Jew, Iam a Jew. And I said I am German, because I hear that so often, you know. So finally explained to me a chaplain that, I don't even know the name, Kaplan, Kaplan was his name. He said don't ever say that again. So they put me in that hospital.
  </p>
  <p id="343">
   Q: This 1s in Salzburg?
  </p>
  <p id="344">
   A: In Salzburg. They put me in that hospital and that was -- the war ends on that day and there were a lot of shooting going on. And I was scared because there were only German people in there. So I explained it to them. Then they transferred me to -- they transferred me to Landis Kartenhaus (ph) in Salzburg.
  </p>
  <p id="345">
   Q: This is the American Army that kind of took you under its wing?
  </p>
  <p id="346">
   A: Right. They put me in that Lazarette, in that hospital with the German soldiers. I didn't want to go in there, I was afraid. So finally they send me to Landis Kartenhaus, (ph) and there I was about a month, month and a half.
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   Q: Was that also in Salzburg?
  </p>
  <p id="348">

  </p>
  <p id="352">
   A: Skeleton. Real skeleton. But like I say, Iam lucky I am alive. I am still alive.
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   Q: Where was your future brother-in-law at that point? Was he still with you?
  </p>
  <p id="354">
   A: No -- I was in the hospital and he met one of the kapos in Salzburg from our camp, too. It was a Viennese, too, and all of a sudden he came -- an American soldier came in the hospital, and I looked, it was the kapo from the camp. It was a Jewish boy wearing an American uniform. I said, "How you got on a uniform?" He worked for the CIC, and I did the same thing. When I got out, I worked a few months in Hielbrunn.
  </p>
  <p id="355">
   Q: So you were in recuperating from typhus?
  </p>
  <p id="356">

  </p>
  <p id="358">
   A: I got out and I went to the American Army for a few weeks. I was looking for SS people.
  </p>
  <p id="359">
   Q: They hired you, the American Army?
  </p>
  <p id="360">
