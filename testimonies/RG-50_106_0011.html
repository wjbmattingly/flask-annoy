Something not exactly soothing her and beat a young woman to pieces, and honestly that girl fainted. And I looked with such hatred to that couple, how can a Jewish woman do this to another Jewish woman that she felt it and came over and beat me the same way. That was the only beating that I recall. That was already in the camp.

   A: I think 1t was women, but I'm not 100 percent sure. It didn't make any difference anymore. It didn't make any difference anymore. It didn't quite feel like a human being. Somehow I don' t know. And then we got in a place like a room where they gave us food, but I couldn't even look at it. It was red. It must have been red meat, and it reminded me of blood. And I couldn’ t swallow even though I was very hungry, whatever + we were bringing, it was already taken away and they said they would give it back, but we never saw it.

  <p id="435">
   Q: Umhum.
  </p>
  <p id="436">
   A: Anyway, it had shoelace. And we tried to-- if we could get hold of a newspaper to stuff it because they were https://collections.ushmm.org 33 all way too big and the newspaper holds a little bit of heat.

   A: Not necessarily.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: Or late teens?
  </p>

   Q: Okay. So, you -- what was the boat ride like?
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: Fine. There was nothing to it. I mean it was a little adventure, a little different from the usual daily intake, you know, you' re young. You enjoy every new change.

  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: These were Jewish tombstones?
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: No question about it because of the writings, the Hebrew letters, and that's what we were breaking up. The interesting thing it was, it was very cold.

   Q: Were you somewhere in between because you said you had stayed a week or so in Auschwitz so that would just be June.
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: Yes, but I must have been somewhere. Let me have, if I it won't help me. After I went to Auschwitz, we were transferred to Stoll and to Stutthof.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: And these were labor camps?
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: Labor camps, yes. They were labor camps. Now, here it's a very interesting thing. I got the job. I had a very good friend who actually who was actually in the underground in Germany as https://collections.ushmm.org 38 well I mean in Austria as well as in Hungary. And we have decided since somehow or other our first cousins scattered or were assigned different kind of camps. We going to stay like sisters. So she took up my maiden name. Suzy Jakab or Yakab. I had a first cousin, Suzanna, that I was seeing from first grade on together. She was not there anymore. She was assigned to some other job. So anyway she became Suzy Jakab. And was represented a sister of mine and we really stayed together to the very end. Now the interesting thing it was, that for me to work outdoors, shoveling things, it's very difficult, I'm not physically strong. She was very strong physically so she took over the heavy job. And the job she got that was a sort of like a railroad inside the big barn looking thing that they were transporting items from one to the other. She taught me how to use that particular machinery. It was something like a railroad. And you had a little, like a little choo choo train to drive it. I drove it several times against the wall. That they didn't kill me for it I don't know, but anyway I did it. But what did she teach me to do, I never did in my life to sabotage the inside, what is inside. Two of us sometimes went in there breaking things and then receiving the box __+ like it would have arrived, you know, it arrived broken.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: How did you break them?
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   A: What do you mean how did you break them? If you smash a carton which has light bulbs in it, how does it break, okay, or if you puncture plastic bottles with some kind of chemicals, what happens to it, all right? We took really big chances. We could have been hung for it.
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: Why do you think you were so brave?
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: I don't know, because she encouraged me. And I think that somehow or other I felt that it's coming to them. I mean they did, I mean they kill us without even I mean, we are not human beings with them. They exterminating us. So what, so we do a bit of damage, too. I mean really it was my step sister so called that we cooperated, and somehow we got away with it. https://collections.ushmm.org  39

  <p id="524">
   Q: Was this in Stuffhof that you are talking about?
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   A: It was either Stuffhof or Stoll or maybe both places. And that was before we even ever got on the road to Riga.
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: Did anybody ever find out that you did this?
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   A: No, I don't know if anybody found out who did it, but that somebody did it. That's for sure.

  <p id="528">
   Q: But you were never found out?
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   A: Well, we could have been hung for it easily or shot for it easily without any whatever. But somehow it was a revenge.
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   Q: Did you tell anybody else you were doing this?
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: No, only between the two of us. It was our secret. I don't know. I mean it's unbelievable. For instance for many, many years, many, many people ask, you know, did you tell your children? I said why should I darken their young ears with horror stories such as this? And I never did. It was very difficult for me to even think about these things, nevertheless to talk to my own kids or to my grandchildren. Sometimes my son asked about interesting stories. I said I might have interesting stories, but it's not for the ears of children. Those are horror stories. Those are ghost stories. And I don't want to frighten them.
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: What were the living conditions like in Stutthof?
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: Not too bad. Not too bad. We had those bunk beds, which I hate to this day. I wouldn't have a bunk bed in my house or nothing. And all of my grandchildren do have bunk beds. And when I see them, I say, honey, how can you put lovely grandchildren stack over stack. I mean all right, it saves beds, because the bedrooms are not and especially if you have five kids, you do need the space, right? But just recently, my youngest, _ + youngest daughter, who's eight years old fell off the top of the bunk bed splitting her head. https://collections.ushmm.org  10

  <p id="537">
   A: Food was fine.

   A: Well
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: Did they give you more clothes?
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: Not necessarily. You get used to it. It's very I was really working indoors. It makes a big difference. My so called stepsister took the heavy part of the job and when you work with the shovel and filling dirt or whatever, you know, you work physically hard, you do get warm.

It's an awful feeling seeing those Hebrew letters scattered and using for gravel for filling in roads or whatever. It's an awful feeling for the person who is doing it and you have to. There is just no two ways about it because those supervisors are standing over you and you have a certain assignment and you have to break up this much during your work day, and that's all there is to it. There is just no argument about it.

Anyway I was walking by at one of the guardhouses or one of the officer's houses and I heard some beautiful music. And I sort of crouched down under the window and listened. And it dawned on me that is the moonlight https://collections.ushmm.org 47 sonata, Beethoven. And I can't hardly describe the feeling. There are still people who can enjoy music and live a normal life, and I'm still hearing a few snatches of music and enjoy it. Now, that sort of emotionally upset me unbelievable. And I was telling my so called stepsister, Suzy, that, you know, what I heard that afternoon. And then we were discussing all sorts of concerts we've seen and poetry being read, and I mean things which we really enjoyed in life and it just nonexistent anymore. And, you know, thinking back it just it just unbelievable. It is just unbelievable. I'd love to show you, but I don't think we really have the time, I do have some unbelievable copper work with the designs from the shawa (ph) but I don't know if you would have time for that.

  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: Apparently. I had lost one first cousin during that particular march, not her sister was next to her. But she fell out and they didn't let her help her up or anything. There was three sisters, and two of them made it and one didn't.

   Q: Do you know approximately how long the march took?
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   A: It must have been at least a week or more, at least. All I know is that somehow towards the end we wound up in the Saar region dancing, and that's where I was liberated by the Russian soldiers.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   Q: Okay. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about liberation unless there's anything else about the march that you remember?

  </p>
  <p id="697">
   A: Yes, the trenches, that the Germans themselves used. My stepsister, Suzy, Suzy Jakab or Jakabs, Suzy Jakab. She got shrapnel through her eye.
  </p>
  <p id="698">
   Q: Was this on the march?
  </p>
  <p id="699">
   A: No, that happened already when we arrived to the Saar region. We were dancing in one of those bunkers, all right? The place where we arrived was heavily bunked by the Germans. And they asked for five volunteer women to peel potatoes. And that was asked by German soldiers. And we decided what did we have to lose, at least we eat for a few days because whatever rations they gave, if you peel potatoes, we get the benefit ourselves. So we went potato peeling, five of us. That was myself and my stepsister and three other women. And after about a week of this treat, because really it was a treat because we ate, the soldiers said now you have to return to your camp. And we thought surely the moment we going to turn our back, they are going to shoot us, but they didn't. They walked thataway and we walked thataway. And after a few minutes we looked back, we didn't see the German soldiers, we saw the bunker flocked down in there. So there was a bombing. The Germans were bombing that Saar region. And my sister or stepsister got a shrapnel through her through her leg.
  </p>
  <p id="700">
   Q: Eye?
  </p>
  <p id="701">
   A: I was next to her like even closer than I am to you right now. I didn't have a scratch. But anyway I ripped up something. I don't know whatever she wore or I wore to make a tourniquet, all right? And then after about after about 24 hours the German Russian soldier said that the war is over and handed the first cigarette I'd ever seen in my life. It was a hand rolled, hand rolled and hand cut tobacco. So anyway I never smoked. And I handed it to my stepsister who https://collections.ushmm.org 51 was actually in the underground, and she was a smoker already from the age of 16 or whatever, not that it helped her because she wasn't paid. We didn't have anything. So after about a day or so ambulance came and took all five of us to a hospital. But three of the women were pretty good looking, hefty looking were raped in front of my eyes.
  </p>
  <p id="702">
   Q: The other three women?
  </p>
  <p id="703">
   A: The other three, not me. I was like a walking skeleton and, of course, my stepsister was injured with the tourniquet and the loss of blood so she was got away.
  </p>
  <p id="704">
   Q: Who raped the other three women, the Russians?
  </p>
  <p id="705">

  </p>
  <p id="708">
   Q: Were you afraid it was going to happen to you?
  </p>
  <p id="709">
   A: Ina way, yes. But then again, I looked at myself, and I said who would want this walking skeleton even to touch. I mean I was just really skin and bones even though I was still young.
  </p>
  <p id="710">
   Q: Had you been getting your period during the war?
  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: No, I didn't for a whole year. I didn't for a whole year. I was convinced that there is something in the food which suppresses all that all that feminine action. I mean it's part of life.
  </p>
  <p id="712">
   Q: Umhum.
  </p>
  <p id="713">
   A: But the doctor convinced me that's not the case.
  </p>
  <p id="714">
   Q: So
  </p>
  <p id="715">
   A: Actually I became pregnant in August.
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: We'll talk about that. What was your feeling when the Russian soldier came and told you the war was over? What do you remember what you thought? https://collections.ushmm.org 52
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: I was hoping it's true. And then I heard also horrible thing, which I heard. There were very few people sort of half dead, half dead wandering around that camp. It's called Mashata (ph). It just occurred to me. Mashata (ph) _ +.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: So you didn't quite believe it when you first when the Russian soldiers said the war is over?
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: Not really, however, the Germans did something horrible. There were few sort of half dead wandering around. It looked like that the whole camp was either + or diseased or, you know, just ready to be buried. The few alive people who were still alive transported on a boat and the boat was blown up so they all went down. They all went down. That's awful that the Germans did that. Now, that's something which they they didn't gain by killing another 50 people or another 25 people, but they did it.
  </p>
  <p id="720">
   Q: After liberation, you were with your sister?
  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: So actually what you want me to tell you, what do you want me to tell you?

  <p id="725">
   A: She was in the hospital, and it just so happened that the farmer's daughter died in the same room where my stepsister was, Suzy. Okay? And I went to that farmer. I said I will be glad to work for them if they let me visit my sister at least once a day or at least three times a week so I see how she's getting along. So I was so I was with Polish farmer. They didn't even know I'm Jewish. And I never advertised it because I didn't know. I didn't trust them.

   A: Sometime in the hospital most likely.
  </p>
  <p id="732">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="733">
   A: All right? The number didn't make any difference because the political prisoners had numbers also. And they were not that well educated. So anyway I went to see my sister, how she's coming along, and she was sometimes on very high fever. And we were very, very concerned, but she had a very strong constitution and she pulled through very good. And anyway I went and I was able to take a little meal again, a little cheese and a little sugar or whatever they gave me. God forbid that I should take 1t without asking. But I asked if I may take something for my sister. And I was scrubbing the toilet for them and I was tending the whatever _ or feeding these or whatever I was assigned to do. It didn't make any difference to me as long as I was able to provide a little help for my helper. And slowly but surely she got a little better, but I got very bad, and I was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks for better nourishment, and it was middle of or end of July that finally

  <p id="737">
   A: Russians, yes. It definitely was. The Saar region was definitely occupied by the Russians, yes. And then I was admitted to the hospital for a little better nourishment to build up my strength. And then finally we got our walking papers, and then it took a few kilometers, a very few kilometers either by train or by bus or by whatever to get closer and closer because we https://collections.ushmm.org 54 wanted to approach, again, my city, that if there is anything underway somebody will be registered. And the first sign of registration I found in Budapest. That took a good two months.

  <p id="738">
   Q: How did you ride on the train? Did you need tickets or would they just let you ride?
  </p>
  <p id="739">
   A: No, we had papers. We had papers, you know, so many kilometers. I mean there was always Jewish communities who were helping people to get home and search for their relatives.

  </p>
  <p id="749">
   A: Well, I was very happy at least that I was married and we were in love and it was a wonderful feeling, that he's looking for me and I'm looking for him. But I found no trace of my parents nor of my brother, and that was a very sad thing. The interesting thing that when we met in my city, the first thing I said let's go home. I have a feeling there is nothing to look for and we can find out later if there is anybody alive.
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   Q: So you went from Budapest back to your town?

   A: We stayed until King Carl was exiled. I mean he had to leave the country, and then his son, Mikial (ph) became king. And when he had to leave also, I said I'm not going to raise my son under Stalin after Hitler. And that's when we decided that we leave and how did we leave? We paid a peasant to sneak us across the border to Hungary or a hay bagger. And the three of us went to Hungary and then from Hungary to Austria and then from Austria to Munchen. And from Munchen, we requested the refugee porter to the United States, and it took us a year. Arriving in the United States in '49, in '49.

   A: Yes. Arrived to Ellis island. Peter had the measles so we were quarantined. Then we got to New York finally, and I said this is not the city I want to live in United States. And that's how we got to Memphis, Tennessee. I wanted a leisure southern town, friendly so I heard, and it was lovely. I really liked Memphis, Tennessee. That's where my kids were educated. There was a very lovely Jewish community. There was a Jewish school. It started with kindergarten, and then it became a yeshiva, a high school for the girls. I mean it really turned out lovely.

I wanted to teach actually in Israel, but at the time that I have finished the nikliv (ph), I would have been a certified teacher, I was close to 60. There is no way in the world that you can get a permanent job or __ at that age. There is no way. So I just gave up. Who needs a piece of paper if I cannot earn anything with it?

  </p>
  <p id="816">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="817">
   A: Every year there is no grandchild that was born without me. And I have 13. God bless them.
  </p>
  <p id="818">
   Q: Wonderful. Can we https://collections.ushmm.org 59
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   A: [have three great grandchildren. I think I told you. Can we? Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   Q: Can we now talk a little bit about your feelings and reflections about your experience? Has the war, your experience during the war, has it made you more Jewish? What is your feelings about being Jewish considering what you went through?
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   A: I'm very proud to be Jewish. But then again on the other hand, I'm very proud to be Jewish. And I declare it especially here in the United States when they the people make completely uncalled for remarks, you know, jew you down or, you know, expressions such as that. So usually make the remark, the Jewish people usually are very fair and sincere, and they don't want to cheat people out of anything. As a matter of fact, you can rely on a Jewish person because holically (ph) or according to the law it's a sin to cheat. And anybody who's observant is going to respect that. There's another thing, which is very much observed that is in the ten commandments to respect and honor your elders. That's a very important thing in the Jewish law. That's one of the dos instead of do nots. And I think that the almighty was very kind to us. That was when we reach a certain age that we need protection and we need his protection. I think it's wonderful.
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   Q: You had said that you really didn't talk to your children or grandchildren very much
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: about your experiences. Did you ever share your experiences with others?
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: No, hardly. It's difficult. It hurt to talk about it. It hurts to talk about it. Now, what would I say to a ten year old? And then he's going to look at the other young mothers, maybe they are younger than Iam. I was 30 years old when George was born. And I was 37 when Teddi was born, when my daughter was born. I was 37. She was born in 1960. That is seven years difference between my children. It wasn't my choosing. It just happened so what can I tell a https://collections.ushmm.org  &lt;0 child about my experiences? And then he's going to look at his best friend that he comes over to play football with or hockey or just do homework together. And then he's going to say, what, your mom I mean this is something, you know, you read not even in history I don't think. They don't even have these things in history books or do they?
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: Does the war still affect you? Does your experiences and what you suffered still affect you?
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   A: For a long time I had been asking why me? Somehow I don't ask it anymore. I don't know why me. I mean really and truly so many so much better people perished. I feel, for instance, that I always envied my brother who's younger than me that he's such he's so much better person as a human being than I am. Why not him and why me? Somehow or other I feel guilty about being alive and him not being alive or, for instance, the event that the war was over, and Hitler does not exist anymore so I heard that they committed suicide in their bunker with Eva Braun Brown, right? I asked dear God why did we deserve this? Why did you do this to us? What have we done? I mean I'm not speaking only about our group? It happened in Poland. It was really something. So I don't know. I mean I am asking a lot of questions, but I am asking less and less as the time goes by. I live to see a whole generation of new grandchildren that my two of my granddaughters are married. One of them already have three children. So I have great grandchildren. So maybe there is a purpose in all of these I mean I have three I have a big family again and I came home alone. Alone with my husband, the two of us. It's not alone anymore. But I didn't even know when I was liberated by the Russians that I do have a husband here that took several months to arrive to the particular to that particular moment.
  </p>
  <p id="828">
   Q: Do you receive war reparations?
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   A: No, I never asked.
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   Q: Why not? https://collections.ushmm.org 61
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   A: Because I don't want their money. Money doesn't it doesn't mean that much to me. There is nothing they could they could pay me a million, but my mother and father will not rise from their grave. My parents will always be there, and my brother is nonexistent. I've never asked for reparation. I don't want their money. It's very funny. I'm going to have fantastic expenses, and I know that I don't even know if I'm going to survive this ordeal or not, but somehow I feel that I did not leave in vain. And the reparation would make much different. Maybe it would make a great deal of difference for the children. Maybe I should because of them. But for me money has no, no value in that particular thing. I have seen people selling houses, homes, fortunes, yachts for a crust of bread, really. I mean when it comes down to value, what is value? Life is valuable. How you live your life is valuable, but not money. The money is not doesn't somehow or other I am completely nonmaterialistic. Maybe, maybe it's foolish. And I should be a little bit have a little bit more foresight, and the children are going to be burdened with my expenses and whatever. But for myself, I don't want their money.
  </p>
  <p id="832">
   Q: Is there anything you wanted to share about being Jewish with your children or grandchildren or great grandchildren?
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   A: Yes, to be proud of it. Just to be proud of the fact that they are they have an inheritance, thousands of years old, and be proud of it. It makes me very proud to see my oldest son sit down with the two youngsters, the two ten year olds, Rosalee's son and his son are about the same age. And he's learning with them half an hour every evening, so he's transferring his knowledge, his doctora with the young children and that's beautiful. To me, it gives a wonderful satisfaction. That's value. To me, that's value. It's not the new outfits, and the new bicycles and pizza shops and God knows what, that's beside the point. But the inheritance, our history to be transferred to the children, to teach them how to put the feeling on. To go through bar mitzvah. To be https://collections.ushmm.org  = prepared he prepares them for the bar mitzvah. He doesn't hire another tutor. It's a wonderful thing. To me that means a great deal and so did my younger son, not to mention my daughter. They became so religious. He's teaching in a yeshiva, and she's a__ now. And she's very, very respected in the Jewish community in Brooklyn. And, listen, being in Brooklyn you have to be very religious in order to fit in. And she is fitting in. As a matter of fact, she's a foster mother to aretired _ besides her own five children. I mean I'm very proud of my kids.
  </p>
  <p id="834">
   Q: Wonderful. Anything you'd like to add before we finish?
  </p>
  <p id="835">
   A: Well, I don't know. Ask me. Is there anything I need to add?
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   Q: Just any other thoughts that you have?
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   A: Um?
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   Q: Any other thoughts about what you went through in the war?
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   A: Well, the only thing is that there must be a purpose, only God knows what that I went through, and I'm here. It must be a purpose to it. It couldn't be just a coincidence because I think that in our in the whole world, nothing just happens just by coincidence. Why this happened to us? Why exactly that particular community, 1t was hit so very hard, only God knows. But I'm sure it's not only question of money. We did have some rich people who were able to buy fake papers or went to Switzerland or whatever. Still somehow even they getting a certain tradition with us with them. Don't you think? And they assured us or the survivor of certain amount of people. It's could be it was their own family. It could be somebody outside the family, but I think that it nevertheless saved a certain amount of people. So it was not in vain.
