  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Yes. And I left any way. Hitler came January and I left January 5th. I said I'm not going to stay here, I'm leaving. And I left and went to France to my relatives.
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: It's very unusual that in -- so Hitler came to power in 1933. It's very unusual that a young woman, because, I take it, in 1933 you were almost 20 years old, would have --

  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: 18, 19, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Well, I had my French relatives. Nobody had French relatives. My grandmother was French, was in Alsace-Lorraine.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: But what I want to say is what is so unusual in what you are telling me is that somebody who was your age at that time would have said, I'm leaving. Most people didn't — they didn't like him, but they didn't think he was that dangerous.
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: I said I'm not going to stay. I'm leaving.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: And why? Why did you do that at that moment?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Because I didn't -- I didn't like what happen with Hitler. Our maid protected us, but - and I had my French relatives, so --
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: Later. In 1933, that wasn't happening yet.
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: No, no. But I did say I'm not going to stay. I go to my relatives in France.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: What did your parents say when you said that?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: They didn't like it, but they said go, they said have a life.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: Was your brother there?
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: And I got French citizenship because my grandmother was in Alsace-Lorraine and I got my French citizenship, so I went back and forth.

  </p>
  <p id="320">
   A: They didn't stay in Lindau. They couldn't stay there.
  </p>
  <p id="321">
   Q: What did they do?
  </p>
  <p id="322">
   A: They went somewhere else, to a cousin of my mother. And when my dad -- my dad was in the concentration camp.
  </p>
  <p id="323">
   Q: Which concentration camp was he in?
  </p>
  <p id="324">

  </p>
  <p id="327">
   Q: How did that happen? Did he tell you how he ended up there?
  </p>
  <p id="328">
   A: Somehow, somehow. And when he came out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mom was because she could not stay in Lindau anymore.
  </p>
  <p id="329">
   Q: So he had been arrested from Lindau?
  </p>
  <p id="330">
   A: He was, yes, but then when he got out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mother was, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="331">
   Q: How did he find her?
  </p>
  <p id="332">
   A: Well, he saw a few cousins and he knew where one was and he thought maybe she was there. And she was there. And then I don't know how long it took until they came to the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="333">
   Q: Was he -- did he ever talk about what happened to him in the Dachau?
  </p>
  <p id="334">
   A: No, we never talked about it. I didn't.
  </p>
  <p id="335">
   Q: Ihave the impression, correct me if I'm wrong, that as you were growing up, you didn't see much of your parents; you mostly had interaction with your nanny”?
  </p>
  <p id="336">
   A: That's right. And that's why when I came to the United States, I said I was so little with my parents, I go one year. My brother was a doctor in Queensborough, near Albany. So I say I go there. For one year, I stayed with my parents.
  </p>
  <p id="337">
   Q: Was that the first time you were really close with them in the same area?
  </p>
  <p id="338">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   Q: What was that like because you were already a grownup lady?
  </p>
  <p id="340">
   A: Iwas glad to be with my parents. I was with my parents -- I was 18 when I left. And, you know, I just have to go because I was in Queensborough and I said I have to go one year, I have to go to my parents.
  </p>
  <p id="341">
   Q: But this must have been when your father had left Dachau. Did he seem a different person because of that? Had he been -- did he seem like he was older or sicker?
  </p>
  <p id="342">
   A: Ihadn't seen him for so many years, I wouldn't know.
  </p>
  <p id="343">
   Q: You wouldn't know.
  </p>
  <p id="344">
   A: No. My parents had a very, very, very good life. The minute they came to the United States, they never had to work and my mother had her maid and they lived with my brother.
  </p>
  <p id="345">
   Q: In Albany, or near; in Troy?
  </p>
  <p id="346">
   A: Well, it's between Troy and Albany. He had his office there.
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   Q: Did he still have something with tobacco businesses, your father?
  </p>
  <p id="348">
   A: No, no. He was a doctor.
  </p>
  <p id="349">
   Q: Your brother, I know, but your parents, did your father--
  </p>
  <p id="350">
   A: He didn't have to work.
  </p>
  <p id="351">
   Q: He didn't have to work?
  </p>
  <p id="352">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="354">
   A: No. My parents did not have to work. Only thing was he had a dog, he brushed him and they had a good life. They never had to work. And my brother did it so he made a checking account and another account and put money into it, so they never had to ask.
  </p>
  <p id="355">
   Q: That's very thoughtful. That's very thoughtful.
  </p>
  <p id="356">
   A: Because they came out of -- they came to Seattle when my daughter was born and they came and they never had to ask for money. They never had to ask for anything. So they were very fortunate because there were very few people who were independent with enough money.
  </p>
  <p id="357">
   Q: That's true.
  </p>
  <p id="358">
   A: And my brother always put money in the checking account and when the account got less, he put more in.
  </p>
  <p id="359">
   Q: That's a good son.
  </p>
  <p id="360">
   A: There was never any question.
  </p>
  <p id="361">
   Q: It's more than money. It is also a sign of love and respect.
  </p>
  <p id="362">
   A: That's right. And I was, how shall I say it? My sister-in-law, her mother came from Shanghai and she asked, I went to dental school and I was dental assistant. She asked me if I would take care of her mother because she doesn't speak English, she doesn't -- and so forth. I say, what do I have to do? I don't do housework. She said I don't have to do housework. So we went to our Palm -- our house was in Palm Springs, but it was too early to go to Palm Springs. It was too hot. So we went to Asheville, North Carolina at the Grove Park Inn and stayed there for three months at the Grove Park Inn.
  </p>
  <p id="363">
   Q: So this lady that you were taking care of, was this your future mother-in-law?
  </p>
  <p id="364">
   A: No.
