So he take it one side, and two other people the other side. And really was a physically very, very strong man.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Yeah, we -- we got the ritual dinners, Friday and Saturday dinners. My father, he liked very much his children. He was very strict if you did something wrong, but he took care. God forbid if somebody, an adult or a neighb -- neighbor would touch you, he was in trouble, because he said, I have my children, I will punish them more than you do, but don’t raise your hand in my children.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: So you felt protected.
  </p>
  <p id="51">

He hit me. So hit him back. That time was a different time, no -- no -- nobody carry a knifes and guns, you know, they said, oh, with -- with your fists, you couldn’t kill with your fists other child, anybody. So my father stop at -- he -- he -- he went -- the horses left, and the -- the -- the wagon left and I was 14 year old and I took over these things. I quit school and I started to -- to partially f-feed my -- my family. Plus --

  <p id="55">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: They’re not that familiar with both the situation in Czechoslovakia about the change of Czechoslovakia to Hungary and so on. So we’d like to talk a little bit about before 1941, what life was like, what the situation was like in Uszhorod.

   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="58">

  </p>
  <p id="412">
   Q: So he was the second Dr. Orlich for you.
  </p>
  <p id="413">
   A: That’s right. And I didn’t forgot when I c -- escaped and I c -- was going home, I made five [indecipherable] five extra miles to meet this, and tell him [indecipherable] and kiss his hand. And he said, Andrei, here is a bread, he said, got how much you want. I said, I ashame, I can’t eat all this bread. You give me better a b -- you give me a bi-bigger piece than I ha -- I will take it. And he got me -- he gived me the -- the bread to eat, and I got more bread with -- from another resources and I went to the concentration camp, and I left with him and I told him thank you.
  </p>
  <p id="414">

  </p>
  <p id="415">

  </p>
  <p id="419">

  <p id="420">
   Q: Oh.

  <p id="421">
   A: He was a real coal miner.
  </p>
  <p id="422">
   Q: So in a way can you Say -- 1-1s it what you’re saying 1s that he kept you alive by giving you that piece of bread all the time?
  </p>
  <p id="423">
   A: Definitely.
  </p>
  <p id="424">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="425">
   A: Definitely. And when I was coming back, a German prisoner of war, 17 year old guy like me, he see it -- he was in the same camp and I was, but they divided the camp in two. In one, I was -- I was going for the first one, certain people was sick and they didn’t go with us for the march when [indecipherable]. I want to know what happened to them. They survived, nobody touch them. And -- and -- and -- and the Germans lo -- run away and they were alive. And th-the other [indecipherable] the other half, they were German prisoners of war. And to the fence came a German 17 year old boy like me and he -- he gave his hand, he s -- ask me for a piece of bread. I break it and I give it to him. And people was telling me, some people, that you’re crazy, he just killed [indecipherable] your people and -- and [indecipherable] not he. He didn’t kill. I don’t know what he did, you don’t know what he did. You can’t s -- you can’t say what he did or how long, you don’t see it. I survived with help of Germans, Polish people and others, so it was my due to make him survive. I -- I didn’t know that he is a murder or something. Was a kid, who was drafted to the army. He couldn’t say Hitler, no I’m not going, he would shoot him. You can’t judge -- you know, you got people like that, you got people -- you know, you cannot unify people, th -- ba -- or go by -- by nationality or by religious. That’s not the right way to do.
  </p>
  <p id="426">
   Q: I want to ask you something that’s a little harder to ask. You -- you’re mentioning people who helped --
  </p>
  <p id="427">

  <p id="428">
   Q: -- and who helped you survive and how you helped somebody else survive. Did you also experience people who betrayed you? Did you, either in Uszhorod before 1944, or afterwards when you were in the camps, did you also see that?
  </p>
  <p id="429">

And this 0 -- that -- that time this Jew escaped. I bring down -- that’s the way I could bring down, you know.

  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: That was another question that I wanted to ask about your pre-war years. Were you -- when you grew up, did you grow up in the Jewish community, or did you integrate with Hungarians? Did you go to -- did you have friends who were not Jews?

  <p id="925">
   A: And then they would let me in ’73, in a six months, something like this. They didn’t let me go too easy too, but they let me go. But I -- I was very pushy. I said I have to go. They ask me why, I said because I don’t like anti-Semitism. Said, we don’t have here anti-Semitism. I says, you tell me? And he said, if you think here is such -- th-the -- the chief of the -- of it, he said, if you think here is anti-Semitism, I can make you a Ukrainian.

You went through -- you went through so much and in a short period of time, but as I said, your world turned upside down. What would you want Uri or Natasha, or your grandchildren to understand about what you went through? What would you want them to remember?
  </p>
  <p id="931">
   A: This I know, this life is not easy and they got a father who was thinking about them, to make their life a little bet -- better than he got one. And why -- why -- why I -- I -- I wanted that they know, because if I won’t let them know, nobody gonna give [indecipherable] nobody would -- her -- heard this, and nobody would -- would know this. And this was my decision. [indecipherable] I’m almost 75 year old, 1t can happens some -- something with me, and I take with me in the grave. What don’t make too much sense. We should learn by history.

  </p>
  <p id="940">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="941">
   A: He was a very nice man, really. Very kind. In -- in the Soviet Union wasn’t that easy to talk, cause you never know who -- who -- who gonna report you or something. But I was open with him, and he was naive in some cases. Was a colonel but he was naive. When he retired, he -- he came to me, he said Andrei, I would like to see you go and help collect -- bring in -- buy some potatoes for wintertime for the organizations. I said, I -- I -- I go, but can you give me the order this -- and name of my -- my boss? He said yes. And what makes you -- this different? Said, you are paying here. I -- I said, depending how much you have save [indecipherable] for -- for business [indecipherable]. If you give -- give it his order, then I will have a day 10 dollars, if you give it to mine [indecipherable] you have five dollars. He said you are so smart, I even didn’t think about it. I said, because you don’t need it. You would need it, you would think about it. He swallowed that too, but he w-was a very nice guy, really he was a very wonderful guy.

   A: -- affect. Sure. Sure did.
  </p>
  <p id="950">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="951">
   A: Because people who have it very easy don’t appreciate it. And hard -- hard working people turn out better than people who lives -- the money the -- the parents earn it, or the grandparents. This -- this doesn’t make you a better person, only worse.
  </p>
  <p id="952">

   A: Definitely, definitely.
  </p>
  <p id="960">
   Q: You know.
  </p>
  <p id="961">
   A: I wa -- I was so strong when I was 13 year old, I could take a bag of -- of 150 pounds and -- and go up with in the steps. I got always very strong legs. The legs make the difference. When you see boxing or something, a boxer, when his leg is gone, he is gone.
  </p>
  <p id="962">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="963">

  </p>
  <p id="966">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="967">
   A: You know, this what it helps. I -- my father was always my role model, because what -- what he -- he could do, you know, made me proud o-of him that he -- he cou -- he - he was that strong. He -- he passed away he was 40 year old, so like -- just like Mother. She was born in 1901, and he -- he died in 1941, exactly. My mother I-lived from -- a wa -- 41 year and he 40.
