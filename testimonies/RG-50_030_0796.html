  </p>
  <p id="894">
   Q: Well, it says you’re sent with six other prisoners to Ora, to act as an interpreter. And then it says, in October 15", you’re sent to prison in Bolzano. Why would you be sent to prison in Bolzano?

  <p id="895">
   A: Why?
  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: And then it says, on November 15", some time like that, you’re tried for treason.

   A: Oh, no. A night later, I get a — somebody tells me the captain wants — the — the lieutenant want — wants to see you. So I go down — downhill to where the lieuten- tenant, and I stand on attention in front of him. He had a Iron Cross as a collar. He starts talking, talks for about 10 or 15 minutes, getting excited. And all of a sudden, do you understand? I said no. He said [indecipherable] get out.

  <p id="985">
   A: But he gives me this talk about you gotta climb a mou — a mountain, and you decide that it’s too high, and that you’re not gonna climb it, be-because of — of its hi — height.

   Q: Height, mm-hm.March 3, 2015

  <p id="987">
   A: Says, now do you unders — understand? That’s not a way to win a war. Have you got anything to say? I said, if I had a mountain to climb, and I measured it, the height, and decided it was too high, I would make sh — make shoes who were in good order, and I would run for a pl-place to — to —

  </p>
  <p id="996">
   Q: Bolzano. Well, here is a question that I’ve got. You said earlier that you weren’t very political, you weren’t paying much attention of what was going on in, you know, in Italy, politically. You’re interested mostly in girls. Your father is the one who forced you to be drafted, and then you could leave that. How did you come to know, or come to believe that the allies would win the war, and the Germans would lose it? That’s thinking about strategy, about military, about where the war is going. Not everybody would have had that opinion. They would have just slogged on.
  </p>
  <p id="997">
   A: Well I—I had that opinion from day one. It was a given. As far as I wa — was concerned.
  </p>
  <p id="998">
   Q: Why’?
  </p>
  <p id="999">
   A: And when we were talking about this fo — this time —
  </p>
  <p id="1000">
   Q: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="1001">
   A: — the allies were at the gates of Florence. The guy was idiotic to say that they were going to win the war, when the best that they could do was a better part of the country. They already said we — we don’t n — we don’t — we don’t believe. It doesn’t ma-matter. It’s obvious that they didn’t believe —
  </p>
  <p id="1002">
   Q: They didn’t believe that —
  </p>
  <p id="1003">
   A: — they lost the w — the wa — the war.March 3, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1004">
   Q: And what about the other Italians? You said this one Italian is the one who betrayed you, who overheard you speaking that, saying that, that you would never shoot on American planes. Did most Italians who were now in this situation, as you were, were they also very kind of, nah, the Germans are going to lose? Or were they working for it?
  </p>
  <p id="1005">
   A: I can’t spe-speak to that, because I never really investigated.
  </p>
  <p id="1006">
   Q: Oh, this is a — a little bit — excuse me, let me pull this up like that, and like that, and then we do this. Hang on, just like that, okay. That’s the microphone. Does it —
  </p>
  <p id="1007">
   A: I never investigate.
  </p>

  <p id="1009">
   A: And the mo — the man that — that — [knocking] Come in! [break]
  </p>
  <p id="1010">
   Q: So, we were talking about — about exactly what that German officer said, and how he was — he was telling you about going up that mountain, and you responded, and saying, well, if I had a good pair of shoes, I’d run away instead, rather than climb up that mountain. And they gave you four and a half years in a concentration camp. Is that correct?
  </p>
  <p id="1011">
   A: Yes, but I didn’t hear it well enough to say yes or no.
  </p>
  <p id="1012">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1013">
   A: You speak a little too — too soft. https://collections.ushmm.org March 3, 2015

  <p id="1022">
   Q: It says here, you’re transferred in early December, 1944, you’re transferred to the Bolzano concentration camp.
  </p>
  <p id="1023">
   A: Yeah. But what after that?
  </p>
  <p id="1024">

  <p id="1025">
   A: Anyway, they took me to the prison, and after the prison, they took me to concentration camp.
