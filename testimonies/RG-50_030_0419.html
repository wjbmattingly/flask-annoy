  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: Uh-huh. Did you and your brother go out to the barn and take care of the horses as well, or were you not allowed there?

  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: Was that his name?
  </p>

   A: Can’t think of his name any more. He was -- he also -- he was not just an ordinary hired man, he also helped in the business, he -- he would deliver the horses, on foot, he didn’t get truck like- like you do today.

  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Oh, you did?
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: We did keep a kosher home, but I wouldn’t call it religious. We went to -- Friday nights we went to shul, Saturdays we went to shul. And still we were not [indecipherable] have a memory, there were many more religious people in -- in Koblenz than -- than we were.

  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: No, no, it was a -- it was a game for him, it was a way to get -- if he didn’t get his way, it was a way to get back at me. But there w -- there -- there was definitely anti-Semitism, but before ’37- I think it was thi -- °37 - ’36, it didn’t affect me very much. After that, it --

  <p id="176">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="179">

  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: -- yes. There was a -- a market in -- in -- in Koblenz that my father and grandfather used to go to and I remember in the | -- the later years my -- his -- his brothers and cousins that were cattle dealers would still come to the market and they would -- they would sometimes bring the cows to our barn until the market opened up.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: But -- but that -- the reason for that was because they couldn’t -- it was difficult for them to bring the cattle to the -- to the market.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="187">

  </p>
  <p id="188">

  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: Oh -- oh, oh yes, I -- I remember them, my -- my -- especially my mother writing to South America. There was talk about going to Chile, going to Ecuador. We tried to come to the United States, we had relatives here that had immigrated to the United States early -- early on, and both on my mother’s side and my father’s side. But they made it so difficult for us, so hard. The United St -- especially the United States did. There was a quota, you couldn’t -- and -- and you -- you -- you had to have guarantees that after we -- if -- if you would -- if you would get to the United States we wouldn’t be a burden to the government.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: Right.

  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: Still you couldn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: -- we couldn’t come. We d -- really didn’t want to go to South America. And as it finally turned out, we didn’t. But --
  </p>
  <p id="194">
   Q: Was your mother fluent in English as well as German?
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, yes. She -- she took seven years of French and, I don’t know, four or five years of -- of English. And she worked as a -- as a bilingual secretary for this -- for this paper factory. They made e-envelopes as far as I know, envelopes.
  </p>
  <p id="196">

   A: And they exported all over the world.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: Well --
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: What do you think it was?
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: That we thought that early to get out?
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Cause not everyb -- yes, because not everybody thought that they needed to get out.
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: I -- there were -- maybe it had something to do because we had family in this country already and we couldn't do any business any more. I -- we were not well to do. We were, would say middle -- middle class people. We had to do something to make a living.
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: I know that some of my Jewish friends, their parents didn’t think Hitler would last long, didn’t -- they never got out. In fact, my other fr -- maybe 20 kids my age, my brother and I, we were the only ones -- well, Samuel [indecipherable] got out. Samuel Lintner got out, and Arthur [indecipherable] got out. I think those were --
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: That’s all.
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: -- out of 20 some odd kids, just the four of us got out, the rest of them all perished.

  <p id="208">
   Q: And do you recall talking with other kids about your trying to get out, that the --
  </p>
  <p id="209">

   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: -- you should all get out too?
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: Well, we were kids.
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: It was an adventure for us all.
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: You weren't afraid.
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Weren’t really afraid, we were very uneasy, but we didn’t realize, until my father came back from the concentration camp, from Dachau.
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Yeah, let’s talk a little bit about -- do you remember when your father was arrested?
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: And this is before Kristallnacht? Do you remember?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: It was right around that time --
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: -- that he -- they came and arrested him, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: And did you see that? Did you see people coming?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Who came?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: They came and arrested him. I remember my mother sending me down to where he was supposed to be, and I remember going there. I wanted to find out why, how, where he was. Thought -- it’s so long ago, I don’t -- the particulars I don’t remember, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: Do you remember going by yourself?
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: By myself, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: Was this to a jail, do you think?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: To a place, yes, to -- wa -- I-I didn’t know, it was a big building.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Right. And did you go inside?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: I went inside and I talked to somebody, yes. But the -- they send me -- they send me back home, and --
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: So you didn’t see your fa -- you didn’t see your father.
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: I didn’t get to see my father. Now, I don’t remember that -- that he came home again and then they re-arrested him. I know at about that time he was sent to Dachau.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: And do you remember when you found out that he was -- was there some communication, or was it a rumor that he was sent? Do you have an idea?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: My mother knew.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: How we found out, I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Right. So that -- it must have been awful in the house when he was --
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: Was -- that was very bad, yes, it was terrible for us. Course we didn’t know what went on there, and we didn’t know until after he came home. We -- we knew somebody that my mother -- that was supposed to be with the gest -- Gestapo, with -- with -- with -- or something like that. They had a cigar store where my dad, he smoked cigars, so he bought the cigars, always. His son supposedly had connections, and I remember my mother bringing him a lot of money, how much I don’t know, to help us get my father released from Dachau. I remember a lot of the Jewish men at that time, maybe all of them, were arrested. And after a -- after, I think it was six weeks, he did come home, but that was after Kristallnacht, I remember. Now, Kristallnacht, we were one of the few, maybe -- I have no record of this, but they didn’t come to our house, but -- or to our Jewish friends homes, they were all -- I remember going to a close friend of my parents, to their house, and I remember what it looked like in there. It was, yeah, just -- they destroyed everything, even the -- they went through closets and cut the -- cut the clothes down, they -- they -- they pulled -- i-in the kitchen they pulled the cabinets down and -- and -- and it was a wreck, I remember that. I come back to this because I don’t want to -- I want -- want you know about that, I don’t want to forget it. But when my father came back, we didn’t know when or -- I -- all I remember is I looked down and he looked like a walking skeleton, like a walking dead man. He was quite a robust man and he had -- he ha -- was in terrible shape when he -- when he came back. Of course he was not -- he wasn’t supposed to tell an -- anybody, you know, what -- what happened, but the stories we heard from him, I -- I don’t remember if he told us that right away, or if he told us that later, the things that went on in Dachau, that they were -- but that time 1t was wintertime, they were -- the only clothes they had one was their underwear and a -- a pajama-like -- like outfit. They were up in the morning at -- very early in the morning and stood at attention for two hours. Some were not able to do that and they collapsed. Some had -- remember him telling us they -- they took fire hoses and stuck it in their mouth and drowned them. I remember my cousin Siggy was in Dachau and he was in the same barracks. Seems like it was num -- number -- barrack number nine, and the -- the political prisoners that were there were the -- they were the -- what’s the right word for that, they were the -- they were in command of the barracks. His name was Bellow, nickname, probably a nickname they gave him. Starved him, beat him. But anyway, he - he -- he got in -- he -- he got out and came home.
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: Can I -- can I go back for a second --
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="244">
   Q: -- to Kristallnacht.
  </p>
  <p id="245">
   A: Sure, there are a lot of things that I forget.
  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: Didn’t something happen with your grandfather’s -- didn’t somebody come into your house, some thugs, that they were going to do something and your grandfather somehow stopped them because he had helped --
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: Well --
  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: Do you recall that?
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: -- you know that -- I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: Very [indecipherable] possible.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: Cause it just seems odd that they wouldn’t -- they would not come into your house.
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: They did -- they had [indecipherable] and I remember they had a -- they put a -- a -- a yellow plaque on our -- we had a big -- big two iron [indecipherable] big gate in front that went to the back -- into our backyard, and two SR men stood there to make sure that -- that nobody would come to see us. They -- they probably stayed there for several days, but they never came to the house, they never touched our furniture. As far as I know we -- we were the only ones. We might not have been, you know, but because all of my -- the home -- my friend’s homes were -- were destroyed.
  </p>
  <p id="254">
   Q: Do you remember that night at all? Do you remember being afraid, do you remember staying in your house 1n your -- 1-1n some special place in the house?
  </p>
  <p id="255">
   A: I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="256">
   Q: You don’t. Do you remember hearing noises?
  </p>
  <p id="257">

  <p id="258">
   Q: You don’t remember screaming --
  </p>
  <p id="259">
   A: -- I don’t remember, no.
  </p>
  <p id="260">
   Q: -- or beatings or anything?
  </p>
  <p id="261">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="263">
   A: No, because we were the only Jews on that street --
  </p>
  <p id="264">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="265">
   A: -- see? And the rest they were all -- there were no ghettos.
  </p>
  <p id="266">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   A: They lived all over town, had shoe stores, furniture stores. Some of my friend -- my -- my fr- friend’s fathers were in, you know, ha -- couple of will lawyers. There were -- Goodshak, he dealt in hides. All different trades.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: Do you remember -- yes?
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: Now I -- what I do remember is that my -- that my best friend, they were deported back to Poland, and I think that was in -- I’m not sure -- in ’36 to °37, early, it was early already.
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   Q: This was your best friend?
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: Th -- my best friend, Manfred. Yeah, they -- he -- they had to go back to Kolomaya. This was a -- we were really close, and it -- those were bad, bad times, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="272">
   Q: Do you remember the day he left?
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   A: I -- yeah -- yes. But then I reme -- I also remember that he -- Mr. Rabla was able to come back once, he had -- was for something, I don’t remember, all the -- and he -- he stopped in, he told us where -- where he was, but we were -- never got to -- you know, we never heard from them again.
  </p>
  <p id="274">
   Q: You didn’t?
  </p>
  <p id="275">
   A: Never heard from them again, no. Of course by that time we were pretty well isolated from the -- the rest of the -- of the -- of the population, all social events were only within the Jewish community. But first, you know, they -- I -- I remember this because they talk about it today, the Kulturbund, we had that -- the -- we had concerts, and I remember going to a concert in Koblenz in the synagogue and the Gestapo people were -- I remember them being there. They -- I remember enjoying a concert. Of course, you know, when you’re a kid, you look at things altogether different, you know, than -- it was never -- I-I never took it all that serious.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   Q: Uh-huh.

  <p id="280">
   Q: Right. So it -- but 1t must have been very strange living on your street with n -- with no Jewish- other Jewish people. Did people talk with you, did they --
  </p>
  <p id="281">
   A: Oh yes, oh the kids all -- we were --
  </p>
  <p id="282">
   Q: It was okay?
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   A: Oh yeah, we all -- we -- we played until -- until the day we left.

   Q: Really?

Kids would run along the taxi and they waved goodbye to us. Of course, that was in ’39.
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   A: That was °39.
  </p>
  <p id="290">

  </p>
  <p id="291">
   A: Oh yes, he -- he was -- he -- he had lost a lot of weight, his eyes sunk back in his head. He -- he wasn’t the same any more. Was the -- I -- I -- I -- I -- I know it was the -- they were mistreated, beaten, starved.
  </p>
  <p id="292">

  <p id="294">
   Q: Did you --

  </p>
  <p id="344">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="345">

  </p>
  <p id="355">
   A: Pll come to that. The -- now, the people I stayed with, were -- came from -- of course, came from Germany, too. His name was Erik Schlafi. I don’t know if I -- if I told this to anybody before, yeah. He was the -- the son-in-law of the people my father used to do business with. He had an import export business in -- in -- in Antwerp. He was there since 1933 already. He came from Essen, and he was the German heavywa -- heavyweight champion o -- o-of -- boxing champion of Germany, among other things. He had -- he had to leave in ’33, just as soon as Hitler came to power because he -- at that time he was a member of the Communist party, but he was a Communist that like -- like I’m a Chinaman, you know? But that -- that was the thing to do at that time, he went to the university and -- and the k -- and the -- and his parents were very well-to-do, and he -- and there was a lot of poverty in Germany at that -- at that time, and -- and he wanted social programs to help the poor. And so that -- that -- the university students that -- the way they tell me, it was the thing to do at that time, to belong to the Communist party. And there was some -- Goering was giving a speech in -- as -- the -- the way I remember it, in Munich. And they got into a tussle an-and -- and -- and -- and Erik let him -- hit him good and hard, and they had a -- they had a -- a law -- he had a lawsuit, Goering brought a lawsuit against him. So just as soon as they came to power, they left Germany right away, he had to leave. And they were very good to me until the Germans came to [indecipherable] th-they came to Antwerp May eighth as far as I remember.
  </p>
  <p id="356">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="357">

  </p>
  <p id="358">
   Q: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about that, but you’re there for almost a year with him --
  </p>
  <p id="359">

  </p>
  <p id="361">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="362">

  <p id="438">
   Q: You don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="439">

  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: Do you -- do you think that your parents helped to pay for your stay in Belgium --

  <p id="447">
   A: I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="449">
   A: But I don’t think so, because I know they were not allowed to take any -- anything out of Germany any more, except for some furniture, some -- which we never got anyway, which for some reason we never got.
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   Q: Could they take some money out?
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: Uh, I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   Q: You don’t know. Did they -- did they give --

  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: Nothing?
  </p>
  <p id="457">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   Q: Do you remember if you ate lunch together? Did you eat? Do you remember anything? Do you have any visualization of where you met them? None at all.
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: Not really. Not really.
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   Q: But you and Guy met them?
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: For sure -- yeah, oh yes, we meet them, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: Yes. Do you think the other families were with you? You were alone? You don’t know? Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: Don’t remember any more.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Don’t remember it. Li-Like I said, you know, there’s so many things that -- that I forget and then sometimes I’m reminded of it, you know, and then the -- then it comes back to me.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: Right. Memory is like a maze, you know, it starts -- it pops up and it -- then hides.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: Sometimes my brother remembers things that -- that I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: That’s how it is.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: Let’s take a break --
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: -- because the tape is going to stop soon.
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   A: Okay. End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   Q: Ernie, when we last -- when we were on the last tape, we were talking about the fact that after Belgium was occupied -- attacked and occupied, the Levys left.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: They left before that, though, before they --
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: What did they say to you? I mean, there you are, they’re supposed to be taking care of you, so they leave with their two kids, to go to France?
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   A: War time, and it’s war here. I knew -- I knew he had to leave, he had to go.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: He wa -- but he wasn’t going to take you?
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: Why, do you think?
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: They had a small car. He had his wife and two children. I understood. I had no hard feelings. I remember he made arrangements f -- I don’t even remember if Guy was there or not, that I would stay with somebody. And he left a certain amount of money. Seems like it was 600 francs. And they were supposed to take -- that was sup -- that was supposed to take care of us for a month or so.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: So, you remember something a little bit differently than Guy, he recalls that you came to him with the Weinbergs --
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: -- and then the Weinbergs left, and then you were alone. Di y-you don’t remember it that way?
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: I know I stayed with this family for a ce -- for a certain amount of time, and there were -- seems like two other children, kids my age. I don’t remember if Guy was there or not.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: But that came to an end, after the money ran out they told me that -- go.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Just go.
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: Go. And then Guy and I, we -- I remember wa -- Weinbergs were gone. Where they went, what happened, I don’t remember, and by that time of course, the Germans were -- had occupied Antwerp, and we had no place to go. We found a place down towards where the Jewish section was. There was a house. If somebody told us about it, I don’t know. We stayed up in the attic, it was a -- the house was c-completely abandoned, there was no pi -- as far as the -- there was nobody else living there. We stayed up in the attic, I know that.
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: Why did you stay in the attic? Did you think it was safest?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: I don’t know any more why. I know that’s where we stayed.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: Did you have anything with you? Did you take a little suitcase?
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: Oh yeah, we -- we -- we had our clothes --
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: You did?
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: -- yeah, we -- we had our clothes, oh yeah, yeah. I’m sure. I don’t remember packing my stuff, but I’m very sure we -- we had it. And I’m sure I was looking out for my brother.
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: Were you frightened? You’re 14 years old.
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: Did you feel like a grown-up kid?
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: I felt like I had to survive somehow.
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   A: Didn’t ma -- didn’t make much difference how. And I didn’t feel sorry for myself.
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: You didn’t?
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: No. I didn’t see how anybody could. There was no point in it. I know there was some Jewish organizations left there because I know we went there often, and -- to eat. Like they had li-like a soup kitchen, like. I know every once in awhile we would -- there was a man, a Jewish man. I 0 - it seems like his name was Rabinowitz or something like that [indecipherable] that would bring us a loaf of bread off and on. He wouldn’t bring it, we would meet him someplace and he would give us a loaf of bread. Don’t remember much about that time, but I know we lived there for some time.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: And how -- how is Guy doing? Does he take on your attitude, or is he, because he’s five years younger, which makes him --
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Well about that time I was how old, 13, right?
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: I -- well --
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: 13 - 14--
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: 14.
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: 13 - 14--
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: You were 14.
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: Yeah, 14.
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: Cause it’s 1940, it’s after May of 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: Right, right, yeah, right, yeah, ’40. Yeah, I was 14, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: Right?
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: But he is nine.
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: And he is nine. We -- it must have been at that time too, the Germans were bivouacked in a park, and they have all kinds of food and we would go and talk German -- I -- I know we -- we stayed up nights thinking of stories to tell them. We told them that by -- that we were in Belgium with our parents, and that they were interned by the French. We must have heard that someplace, sure we didn’t fish it out of the sky. They believed us anyway, and we were -- we were left alone in Antwerp. Look, there was food. That’s what we went for, we wanted something to eat.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: Did you have I.D. cards?
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: Nothing?
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: So they didn’t ask for anything?
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: No, no. They were run of the mill soldiers, you know, they didn’t really care. We didn’t had -- they -- all they knew is we spoke German with them --
  </p>
  <p id="524">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   A: -- and told them we were Germans and -- and they gave us food. And that’s how we met Madame Marian in the park --
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: This is --
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   A: -- just out of circumstances.
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   Q: Right, and so this is the same park where the German soldiers are. So you go there --
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   A: Maybe [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   Q: -- daily, maybe?
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: I don’t know any more. We wer -- went there, I know that. And --
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: Wa -- if -- let me just ask you now, before we talk about Marian, when you went to the soup kitchen -- to the --
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="534">
   Q: -- where the Jewish organization was --
  </p>
  <p id="535">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="536">
   Q: -- did you ask them to get in touch with your parents in England? Did you know where your parents were in England?
  </p>
  <p id="537">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   Q: You knew where they were?
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: Yes. I know it today yet.
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: Where were they?
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: Eight Mornington Terrace. Ask me [indecipherable] this morning and I won’t know it, you know, or yesterday, or the day before. Yes, we knew, and at that time were we -- did we correspond with them? I don’t see how, because we didn’t have a permanent address.
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   Q: Right, but I’m wondering if you --
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: There must have been some ti -- time that we did not --
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   A: -- correspond with them.
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   Q: Which must have frightened them terribly.
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   A: Oh, I’m sure that this -- sure it did.
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="549">
   A: But I don’t know how -- don’t remember how long we were like that. Then one day we met this -- this Belgian lady, and she saw where we got -- that we were able to get along with the German soldiers there, and then -- and she took us in.
  </p>
  <p id="550">
   Q: And you trusted her?
  </p>
  <p id="551">
   A: Well, trust, no trust, didn’t have much to lose. Was going to be better on -- than where we were. We went home with her and we stayed there for some time. She -- of course, she took advantage of us because we were able to get -- people were hungry.
  </p>
  <p id="552">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="553">
   A: People would go on bicycles into the country to get food, scrounge food. We found a place there, it was a German barracks not too far from the -- where we lived, and we got food there. We got the -- I remember we got the potato peels, we got all the potato peels. They were -- they make great pancakes, the -- just the peels.
  </p>
  <p id="554">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="555">
   A: Oh, great pancakes, yes. You know there’s a -- beside the peel, there is -- there’s -- there’s some potato left on it, or -- yeah, we lived well. And I got a job in the military bakery, as a German.
  </p>
  <p id="556">
   Q: As a German.
  </p>
  <p id="557">
   A: As a --
  </p>
  <p id="558">
   Q: Nobody asked you whether you were -- did they ask you are you Jewish? They didn’t. They didn’t assume.
  </p>
  <p id="559">
   A: They know a Jew wouldn’t dare do that.
  </p>
  <p id="560">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="561">
   A: Therefore, well.
  </p>
  <p id="562">
   Q: Tell me a little bit about Marian before you get this job. What is she like, that you remember.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   A: She -- I don’t think they were married. Maybe they we -- I -- I don’t really know, to Pierre. He worked for the -- he worked for the trolley cars. Wasn’t a conductor, he took care of the -- of the rail and so on. And they lived in a -- in a -- in -- which is very common in -- in -- in Antwerp, in a below ground apartment they had. And -- forgot the name of the street now. And they fixed up a room upstairs for us --
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   A: -- somehow, yeah, yeah. What? There -- there was a bed, and I remember a window that I looked out of, I remember looking out, and I would see the airplanes coming back from raids over Germany that -- looked at the wings, there were ho-holes in them this big, they look right through the wings and you wonder how they could fly. They were always -- I -- I had a -- a thing there that I would remember some days th-that I [indecipherable] forget this day. I’ve had days before that that I -- I’m -- I’m thinking, you know, that -- that there will be a time that I will think back on this, that we would, you know, survive it, you know. I remember looking out that window wa -- one night and maybe one day, watching those planes coming back. But anyway, we -- we Stayed there.
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   Q: Was she kind?
  </p>
  <p id="567">
   A: Yeah. She was good to us, yeah. Course she had a lot of advantages, too. When I worked at the military bakery I would bring home flour every day in my thermos, fill 1t up with flour.

  <p id="568">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="569">
   A: Yes. And the guys that I worked with, they thought I was German. Some of them -- there were a couple of sailors there, hated me. And I know we got into a tussle at one time and these sailors, they wa -- they -- they were tough, you know, I remember one of them throwing me [indecipherable] seems like it was 15 feet behind them.
  </p>
  <p id="570">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="571">
   A: Yes. And still I got along with them, you know, I just couldn’t let on --
  </p>
  <p id="572">
   Q: Why were they fighting with you, you were a kid?
  </p>
  <p id="573">
   A: I was a German, though, th-they thought I was German.
  </p>
  <p id="574">
   Q: Oh, oh, I see, that was a Belgian soldier, uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="575">
   A: Not Belgian soldiers.
  </p>
  <p id="576">
   Q: Not Belgian sol --
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   A: They were people working there for the --

  <p id="580">
   Q: [indecipherable] right.
  </p>
  <p id="581">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="582">

  </p>
  <p id="583">
   A: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="584">
   Q: -- I don’t know, feeling, here you are Jewish and against what these people are doing --

  <p id="585">
   A: Of course, yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="586">
   Q: -- and yet you’re working for them.
  </p>
  <p id="587">
   A: Yeah, yeah, but I couldn’t let on, except for one time. And I worked there for quite awhile. And that [indecipherable], the guy that ran the -- the German officer that ran the place came from Hamburg, I forgot his name. But that time I was 15 and supposed to get a passport and he helped me write a letter and -- we were so -- we had a lot more luck than brains, that they didn’t find out. Yeah, at the Christmas 1940, I -- I’m sure I told this story to somebody.
  </p>
  <p id="588">
   Q: Tell it.
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   A: Now, by that time the -- th-that we stayed with the Madame Marian, we were in touch with my parents. And my parents by that time were in the United States already. They figured they could help us, at least as well from the United States as -- better then from England. If it would have been anybody else but my mother, we would never have made it. She -- of course this I found out later, you know, she ran and ran and wrote and wrote and -- and -- and -- and she was in touch with Senator Wagner, she came to Washington several times to get -- to get us visas for the United States. Where was I? Where Marian --
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   Q: [indecipherable] Christmas party.
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   A: Yeah, we went -- yeah. At the -- the Germans invited us to a Christmas party, the soldiers did, in 1900 and -- was that 1940 -- ’41 -- no, ’40 --
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   Q: ’40.
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   A: -- ’40 -- ‘40
  </p>
  <p id="594">
   Q: I think °40.
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   A: Yeah, for -- had to be 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   A: Yeah. Couldn’t refuse, you know, so we went. Big long table, one side was Christmas tree. People came in, mostly soldiers, some civilians. The guy sitting right across from me -- now, we- I told you I’m -- we were in touch with my parents, we tried to get papers to come to the United States. Had to get a German passport. We went to the German au-authorities that -- at -- in -- in -- in -- in Antwerp to get this German passport, legitimate, as Jews. The guy that was -- handled our -- some of our [indecipherable] sat right across from me. I thought my heart was going to stop right then and there. Never -- did -- didn’t he recognize us? Did he know? There were no -- they weren’t all bad. Ninety-five percent were bad, you know, 95 percent I can swear to it, they were bad, you know. But there were five percent were good. Because things happened in -- in -- in -- in Berlin that I didn’t tell you about, that --
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   Q: Well, we’ll get there.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   Q: So he does not say anything?
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   A: Never said anything.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   Q: And he knows that you’re Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   A: Right. There we sat, and the commandant of the -- of the garrison there, made a speech, I’ll remember the words that you know, we -- we don’t celebrate the birth of a dirty Jew bastard, he probably said. We celebrate the Christmas tree. And I always say to myself, that son-of-a-gun, he would have known what’s sitting right next to him there. That I remember well. I remember that this guy never said anything, too.
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   Q: Were other things said that were very uncomfortable, or wa-was this mainly a -- that you remember?
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   A: That’s the only thing that I remember about that.
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   Q: That you remember. And is Guy with you?
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   A: Guy was, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   Q: Was he working with you in the -- in the bakery?
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   A: No, no, no, no --
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   Q: He wasn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   A: -- he was too young.
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   Q: He was too young. But they knew him. Did he come -- cause he wasn’t going to school any more.
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   A: No, no, he came with me to get food.
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   A: Course we’ve always had our bicycles nearby, thinking you know that if they catch us, we’re going to run. And we had the routes all mapped out, that we would take. We knew the port of Antwerp very well, that we -- we thought we could lose them and we would get away. There was a article one day in the German newspaper in Antwerp [speaks German here]. And they never caught the -- believed our story. In other words now, there was some people that knew the real stuff, and the military and the newspaper never did catch on. So we were just lucky.
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   Q: Do you think Marian and Pierre were in danger because they were keeping you, if they found out you were Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   A: No, no, not [indecipherable]. So like I said, you know, we -- things get mixed up in my head, there’s a lot of things that I -- that happened while we stayed with them. Among others, they -- I was supposed to be deported, and that must have been after, wasn’t it? Anyway, one -- one day while I was working in the military barrack and we were cleaning socks. There was a machine there that cleaned the socks, with Alphonse [indecipherable] him and me, we were cleaning socks. And the Gestapo, you know, you -- you could spot them a mile away, you know. A car came in, a convertible car came in -- in -- into the -- this military bakery was in a -- in a fortress that was built by Napoleon. Very old fashioned, very old -- th-this car pulls in and there’s a -- a - they caught on with me. And if they catch me, I want somebody -- I want Guy to find out, I want Guy to know. So I took Alphonse [indecipherable] that was working with me there in confidence, I told him, listen here. I’m afraid. I’m really -- and I told him -- told him the truth, told him, hey listen, I’m Jewish. He -- he wouldn’t believe it, you know, and then -- but I told him, I said, if they catch -- please let -- let my brother know. It was a false alarm. But after tha -- after that day, I didn’t dare go back. I didn’t know if he was -- if I could trust him or not.
  </p>
  <p id="620">
   Q: But he didn’t know where you lived?
  </p>
  <p id="621">
   A: Must have. He was going to let my brother know.
  </p>
  <p id="622">
   Q: That’s true.
  </p>
  <p id="623">
   A: But anyway, he -- I never went back to work there after that, I never went back. And I -- apparently they didn’t --
  </p>
  <p id="624">
   Q: They didn’t do anything.
  </p>
  <p id="625">
   A: They -- they didn’t do anything.
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   Q: Was Marian upset that you stopped working, because [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="627">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah, because that was a big deal for her, that -- you know, we’d bring flour every day. She was upset about it, and I know it was before -- must have been before that already. They called off -- I don’t know who did they c -- the authorities told me to report to the railroad station, pack my stuff and -- the railroad station. And I -- I said to -- you know, that was one of the toughest days, I said -- you know, I had to leave my brother. I didn’t think I was -- for some reason I didn’t think I was going to come back from that. Well, I got to the railroad station and -- and Madame Marian went with me, and that -- the Belgian that had -- organized that, probably under the authority of the Germans, I guess, I don’t -- I wo -- and she talked to one of the policeman there, one of the cops there, and he went back home.
  </p>
  <p id="628">
   Q: Do you know what was said?
  </p>
  <p id="629">
   A: [have no idea.
  </p>
  <p id="630">
   Q: You don --
  </p>
  <p id="631">
   A: Ihave no idea.
  </p>
  <p id="632">
   Q: How come Guy -- I’m a little confused about something.
  </p>
  <p id="633">
   A: Ask me.
  </p>
  <p id="634">
   Q: If you’re not in -- if you’re not -- 1f you’re not known as Jewish --
  </p>
  <p id="635">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="636">
   Q: -- so how is there a notice that you were supposed to go down to the railway station --
  </p>
  <p id="637">
   A: Well the --
  </p>
  <p id="638">
   Q: -- do you know?
  </p>
  <p id="639">
   A: Well, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="640">
   Q: Because you had apply --
  </p>
  <p id="641">
   A: The authorities knew that the --
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   Q: Because you had applied.
  </p>
  <p id="643">
   A: Yeah, the -- well, the authorities are -- the Belgian authorities also knew I -- knew I was there.
  </p>
  <p id="644">
   Q: Uh-huh, right.
  </p>
  <p id="645">
   A: They knew I was there.
  </p>
  <p id="646">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="647">
   A: When I went to -- to Levys already, they knew that.
  </p>
  <p id="648">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="649">
   A: The only ones that we had buffaloed were the soldiers, the military a-authority there.
  </p>
  <p id="650">
   Q: Right. Okay, that makes sense.
  </p>
  <p id="651">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="652">
   Q: Did you --
  </p>
  <p id="653">

  </p>
  <p id="662">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   A: They put it on too. Well anyway, I -- I -- but then, shortly after that, I -- I know that -- that summer we were both barefoot, we [indecipherable] but that wasn’t all that uncommon in -- in Antwerp --
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   Q: No?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="667">
   A: That -- that petered out after that. St -- don’t remember any more just how it came about. Anyway, my brother stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Best.
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: How did that happen?
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: Sure we met them through Mr. Rosenbaum. He was the cantor of the -- of the Hallenser shul there.
  </p>
  <p id="670">

  <p id="675">
   A: Somehow we went be -- we went to him, got to him, and -- but that time there were no services any more, there were no -- and he put me up in the shul. There was a room there that I st- that I stayed in.
  </p>
  <p id="676">

  </p>
  <p id="677">
   A: No.

   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: Now, Mr. Best was Jewish, Mrs. Best was not, and I guess nobody knew that he was Jewish. And they had a little girl Guy’s age.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: And he just f-fit right in and they were extremely good to him. Nice people.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   Q: Did you want to stay there, or that was not possible?
  </p>
  <p id="687">
   A: Well, it wasn’t possible. I didn’t really care where I stayed, as long as I had a place to stay.
  </p>
  <p id="688">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   A: And he got me a job in a -- ina p -- as a plumber, and I got to -- to -- the work papers yet. I don’t know if you got them or not. I think I -- I still got ‘em, anyway. I didn’t know anything about plumbing. All I remember 1s the f -- the first job I got that th -- that they gave me there was I had to split a piece of steel in half with a hammer and a chisel and I remember that thumb was this thick. I hit my thumb more often than I hit the -- hit the chisel.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   Q: So did anybody train you, or they just --
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   A: That was part of the training, yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: That was part of the training --
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: -- that was -- yes. And that was the time we went down to -- there was a Mrs. Arum down on Kebitsplatte, one of the main thoroughpare -- fares where they -- right next to the railroad -- near the railroad station where the -- where the diamond [indecipherable] was -- where the diamond -- the exchange was. We would go there periodically to the rest -- she still had a restaurant there, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and Jewish -- th-the Belgian Jews would come there, and she would -- we would eat there off and on. And on Shabbas, I know I went to Mr. Rosenbaum. What the connection between the shul and him was at that time, I don’t really know. I know there was a Mrs. Kleinman that helped us get papers. I remember going to the American consulate, the -- an America [indecipherable] for our visa. Guy and I both went there.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: You saw Guy very often? Were you living wa -- was the synagogue where you were staying -
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: Not very far apart, yes, yeah, yeah.

  <p id="696">
   Q: Not very far.
  </p>
  <p id="697">
   A: Yeah, I saw him. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="698">
   Q: Both of you were optimistic, aren’t you, in some way, as kids?
  </p>
  <p id="699">
   A: I don’t know what we were. I don’t know what we were.
  </p>
  <p id="700">
   Q: Well, you weren’t pessimistic, you didn’t get depressed and stop moving.

We -- I -- I went there every once in awhile. I’ve got -- I’ve got his picture in -- in a note, in back of it, someplace. But when the time came that we were supposed to go to -- to Berlin for our span -- we needed a Spanish transit visa, we had to go -- we had to be in a neutral country to get our American visa.
  </p>
  <p id="704">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="705">
   A: And I think it was this Mrs. Kleinman that -- and it was impossible to do, to go -- you know, get to Germany and -- and -- and -- and get this Spanish transit visa. She got us a paper from the commandant of Belgium, Antwerp, who supposedly had a Jewish girlfriend that -- that she knew. Anyway, we got -- I -- I think his -- his name was Ascher, he got it, you know, that the -- this paper that it gi -- give us permission to go to Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="706">
   Q: But this was after you get a message from your mother.

   Q: And -- and messages are going back and forth to the synagogue or to the Best home, where your brother 1s? Do you know? Do you remember?
  </p>
  <p id="709">
   A: Don’t remem -- I’m -- I’m sure it came to me, but --
  </p>
  <p id="710">
   Q: And this is all by mail, or as --
  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: -- by mail.
  </p>
  <p id="712">
   Q: By just regular mail?
  </p>
  <p id="713">
   A: By mail, yes. And we got these [indecipherable] sure we were asked to come to the consulate, the American consulate. We were not at war at the time. And I remember spending hours sitting on a bench there until it was our turn and then we had got a physical there. Unless you were in good shape, you know, forget it, you know, they wouldn’t -- they wouldn’t take you. And the time came that we were supposed to go to -- to Germany to get the -- the Spanish transit visa.
  </p>
  <p id="714">
   Q: Were you dressed well to go to this physical? Did you have shoes [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="715">
   A: Oh ye -- oh yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: -- we -- we were okay in Belgium.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="720">
   Q: So you passed the physical?
  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: Yeah, passed the physical and -- and everything. We had -- we still had to be in a neutral country. Why -- why -- Belgium was occupied by -- by the Germans, it had to be the next -- the nearest -- the nearest neutral country was s -- was Spain, and in order to -- to get that, we had to be th -- had to go to Berlin, that was the closest Spanish consul. So we packed our stuff and we had the necessary papers, and we were on our way to Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="722">
   Q: Was that very nerve-racking, because now you’re going back to the --
  </p>
  <p id="723">
   A: Oh, oh yes, yes, didn’t like it a bit. We felt very uncomf -- and on the -- and on the train and starting out in Antwerp, there were a lot of Belgians that went to work in Germany. Some German soldiers that -- that went on leave to Germany. And we were sitting in that compartment, you know, with -- and we didn’t want anybody to know who we were.
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="725">
   A: And we got to the -- must have been the border between Belgium and Germany. I don’t -- everybody had to get off the train, papers got examined, and I think it was the SS, I’m not a hundred percent sure. Hah, [speaks German here]. Two Jewish boys. Come on, we’re going to shoot you guys. And they took us in to a -- to a room, interrogated us, went through our luggage. Guy made some kind of a remark, they slapped him around. Until I came up with that paper from this Commandant Ascher, they let us go.
  </p>
  <p id="726">
   Q: Hm.
  </p>
  <p id="727">
   A: And we got -- I don’t know, we got back on the train, and next stop was Berlin, you know, that’s quite a -- quite a -- quite a bit --

  <p id="728">
   Q: Was Guy very hurt?
  </p>
  <p id="729">
   A: No.

  </p>
  <p id="733">
   A: No, never touched me.
  </p>
  <p id="734">
   Q: That must have been pretty scary for you two, though.
  </p>
  <p id="735">
   A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, sure.

  <p id="736">
   Q: Those guys.

  </p>
  <p id="739">
   A: Yeah, well, what are you going to do, you know, we couldn’t run away, they were right there. They had rifles. But anyway, so we -- we got to Berlin and --

   Q: And who met you? Did someone meet you?
  </p>
  <p id="741">

He said what, you know, he -- he was afraid to talk to -- how come you’re not wearing a -- how dare you walk around without the -- a Jewish star? So I -- I -- I th -- explained to him that we just got off a train and we didn’t know anything about it. Well, he told us again, you know, which way to go and somehow got there. There were not many people there, but I -- I don’t -- don’t know if they expected us, they didn’t expect us. I think they did, I ma -- I think expect us. Somehow there was communication. The --

  <p id="769">
   A: There were -- it seems like a few child -- there were more -- there were several boys older than I was. At that time I was 15, they were 18 - 19 - 20.

But he had all kinds of difficulties [indecipherable]. He had to get German papers. I remember one day being in the -- 1n the -- we had to get some papers from the SS, and I was told to move some furniture, and I spent maybe a couple, two or three days there, maybe more, moving furniture for them.

  <p id="776">
   Q: You didn’t?
  </p>
  <p id="777">
   A: No, but that didn’t bother us either. It must have been enough to -- to k -- to keep us alive. We would -- crazy thing, I -- I did such foolish things. We went sight-seeing and took our jackets, you know, so they wouldn’t see that we were Jewish [indecipherable] our arms.

   A: And couldn’t wait until we would get to Spain. Don’t remember how long it took, the -- these trains didn’t go very fast at that time. Took quite awhile until we got to -- through France, until we got to the -- to the Spanish border.

   Q: Nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="954">
   A: No, no. Our papers, that’s it. No money, no. We got to -- to the Spanish border and we had to get off the train and get our -- our baggage. I know there were German soldiers there that went through our baggage, through our papers. And we had to leave this -- the train and get on -- it seemed like we -- it seems like there was a -- a special car for us there, just the car, not -- not -- not th -- a complete train, and now that I start talking about it, I remember these anxious feelings to get out of German occupied country, into -- anxious to get to Spain. And it -- after they tif -- they load us onto this car, they -- they backed us in -- in -- on-onto another -- on -- on another railroad track so that we could get hooked onto the Spanish train. It seemed to take forever til they finally hooked us on, and it was just a little ways into -- into Spain. And we were so relieved, you know, I mean, that -- wh-when we got to San Sebastian that [indecipherable]

  <p id="965">
   Q: You didn’t have one?
  </p>
  <p id="966">
   A: No. I think we were told to take it off, and -- and Guy, my brother, packed it into his suitcase, and he wasn’t supposed to. I guess the Germans didn’t want anybody to know about this.

   A: By -- by train, and the -- the bun -- the bandits came on the train with us, I remember, and -- and they -- the Spanish police were on the -- on the train. They wore these funny, black hats. I remember a -- a young -- a young guy getting out of the train that got into our car, and I didn’t know Spanish. Somehow we made each -- h-he made us understand that he w -- that he’s hiding from the -- from the police, and the -- as they came through we made like he was one of us so he wouldn’t be bothered, yeah, so I remember that, yeah.

   A: We stayed -- maybe a half a dozen stayed in the place where we stayed. A half a dozen stayed in -- 1-1n -- in different hotels in -- in Barcelona. And it was all arranged by the Joint.
  </p>

  <p id="1045">
   Q: Yeah, right. So they may have stopped there, but they -- you think they were all going to the same ship that you were going to, or trying to?
  </p>
  <p id="1046">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1047">
   Q: Or you don’t know? No?

   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   Q: Did you feel the need for that, or you didn’t care?
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   A: Well, I know we -- we -- we got together with two more kids, one or two more kids in Barcelona, because I remember going on sightseeing trips with them. I remember there was a -- up on the hill there was a cross, it’s still there, you know. I remember we -- I don’t know if I should tell this in -- but why not?
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   Q: Why not.
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   A: In -- in -- in -- in Spain, in Barcelona, we had no money. What made me think is we went on this excursion with these kids, you know, we -- we bought bananas to take along. We had money- because we had money. We knew some of the people that were with us, and -- a-and -- and we wanted to visit them in the -- these other hotels on the [indecipherable] de Cataluna, that’s where this hotel [indecipherable] the Hotel Laurette. And I sat in a chair like this, I want to try that here, too, maybe it happen here. And for some reason, you know, I -- I reached back here and I came up with a handful of change. I said, that’s not bad, you know? I went to all the chairs in the hotel, you know, and -- and it seemed like every once in awhile the -- people would -- it would fall out of their pockets, you know --
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1058">
   A: -- in the -- and then -- and I had enough money to buy bananas, because f -- Spain was a very poor country at that time, extremely poor. Food was very scarce, what we mostly ate was cabbage, that was our -- our main -- main -- how do you say that, staple?
  </p>
  <p id="1059">
   Q: Meal -- staple, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1060">
   A: Yeah. [indecipherable]

  <p id="1061">
   Q: So you took an excursion, you bou -- you bought the bananas and went on this excursion.
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   A: Right, you know, we st -- we were there for si-six weeks, in -- in -- in Barcelona.
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   Q: So what in heaven’s name did you do for six weeks?
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   A: Walked all over Barcelona, we walked. Waiting for -- well, we missed one boat. Something happened that -- I don’t remember what, that we didn’t get onto this boat and then the -- I know there were -- this Joint Distribution com -- Committee did all that to get -- get us onto another boat.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   A: Which finally left from -- from Lisbon. But I didn’t -- we didn’t know how long we will be in- in -- in -- in Barcelona. And, guess there was nothing to do for us, we -- we --
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   Q: So how did you get an appointment with the American consulate? Did you just keep trying?
  </p>
  <p id="1068">
   A: I know we got appointments, we had an appointment, we went there.
  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   Q: He wasn’t very nice to you, was he?
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   A: No, no, he wasn’t, no. And I'll never forget, he -- we were asked to come to see him and into his room. Yeah, I remember he had -- he put his feet up on the desk, you know, and -- and he didn’t believe us that we got out of Germany, I don’t know why not. And he was -- he -- he refused to -- ou -- give us our visa, but we had a -- we had a f -- was it a letter or a photocopy of a letter from the State Department that my mother got, that to any consulate, if he would get that, that they should issue us a visa, and well he -- eventually he did.
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   Q: What did he think you were doing?
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   A: I have no idea. Like he -- he was not very cooperative, he didn’t --
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   Q: Your brother --
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   A: -- he hated -- he hated to -- to give us a visa.
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   Q: Your brother thinks he was very anti-Semitic. Do you remember him that way?
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   A: It’s all possible.
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   A: It’s possible. I don’t -- don’t remember that.
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   Q: So did you have to go back more than once for him to agree or did you just stay with him until he finally agreed?
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   A: Well, we -- seems like we went there several times.
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   A: We finally did get it, you know, we -- we did get it, and -- and one day they told us, you know, we -- we have to go to Lisbon, and they put us on a train to Lisbon.
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   Q: So this is the Joint who is telling you?
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   Q: Because you missed the last boat from Barcelona --
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   A: Yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   Q: -- you have to go and get the --
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   Q: -- the boat from Lisbon.
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   A: Right. Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
   Q: So now are other people traveling with you again as part of this [indecipherable] group --
  </p>
  <p id="1094">
   A: To Lisbon?
  </p>
  <p id="1095">
   Q: -- or are you alone?
  </p>
  <p id="1096">
   A: I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="1097">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1098">
   A: What I do remember 1s, that there were several Gestapo agents on the train with us.
  </p>
  <p id="1099">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="1100">
   A: Like I told you, that you can spot these guys a mile away. All -- well, something else, being in- in -- in Spain at that time, we were not that secure anyway. There were a lot of German soldiers there that came -- that s -- on -- on -- on leave, the -- the Germans had -- they went to Spain because Franco was -- was allied with Hitler.
  </p>
  <p id="1101">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1102">
   A: And after we finally settled down in -- in Barcelona, we -- we were ill at ease seeing all -- quite a few German soldiers. We didn’t expect it.
  </p>
  <p id="1103">
   Q: And how were the Spanish to you? Were you -- were you able to pick up some Spanish so you could speak a little bit, or no?
  </p>
  <p id="1104">
   A: Oho, very little.
  </p>
  <p id="1105">
   Q: Very little.
  </p>
  <p id="1106">
   A: Quatta, questa, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1107">
   Q: Uh-huh. Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1108">
   A: And -- and -- and -- and -- and a few -- a few words. The Spanish, very little contact, a few people where we stayed in the pensionne. Don’t -- don’t really remember. We had -- we -- we- we stayed mostly by ourselves and with -- with this -- with the group that we were with.
  </p>
  <p id="1109">
   Q: Did the Joint warn you about walking around and staying away from Germans if you see them? German soldiers?
  </p>
  <p id="1110">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1111">
   Q: They didn’t warn you.
  </p>
  <p id="1112">
   A: No, no. In fact, I don’t remember anybody in particular, how we were notified th -- where to go, where not to go, when our appointments were with the -- with --with the authorities there, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1113">
   Q: But somebody must have, right?
  </p>
  <p id="1114">
   A: Oh, I’m sure --
  </p>
  <p id="1115">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1116">
   A: -- yes, yeah, somebody did, yeah. Somebody -- but I don’t --
  </p>
  <p id="1117">
   Q: So you didn’t make the appointment --
  </p>
  <p id="1118">
   A: No.

  <p id="1119">
   Q: -- with the counselor.
  </p>
  <p id="1120">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1121">
   Q: They made it for you.
  </p>
  <p id="1122">
   A: They made it for us, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1123">
   Q: It’s a little surprising to me that no adult went with you. If they were making these appointments, why wouldn’t they go? You’re -- you’re children.
  </p>
  <p id="1124">
   A: Maybe they --
  </p>
  <p id="1125">
   Q: Doesn’t that surprise you?
  </p>
  <p id="1126">
   A: Maybe they did, I don -- I don’t remember any more. All I remember 1s -- is talking to a -- to the people at the -- at the consulate there.
  </p>
  <p id="1127">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1128">
   A: Nobody seemed to talk for us, or at least I don’t remember anybody talking for us.
  </p>
  <p id="1129">
   Q: Were you nervous going to see the American consulate?
  </p>
  <p id="1130">
   A: Yes, oh yes, we were always. There was always tension.
  </p>
  <p id="1131">
   Q: Did you and Guy talk beforehand as to what you would say, and what you thought might happen?
  </p>
  <p id="1132">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah, we always --
  </p>
  <p id="1133">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1134">
   A: -- well, we -- we did most of that in Belgium, but at -- during the German occupation, we -- we practiced at night what -- what -- what they would ask, what they -- the questions they could ask, and what would be an answer that -- that they could believe.
  </p>
  <p id="1135">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1136">
   A: So there was -- of course there was tension, but see, the tensions went away after we were on the boat, and as a --
  </p>
  <p id="1137">
   Q: In li -- in lisb --
  </p>
  <p id="1138">
   A: -- and [ll -- Pll never forget looking back at the harbor and then -- and then Lisibon -- Lisbon, yeah, yeah.

If I’m not mistaken his name was Hyman, his last name was Hyman. He called our name and -- and we talked to him from the railing of the boat, and he was down at the -- standing down there.

   Q: So the Joint must have told her.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="1378">
   A: Yes, December seventh, yes, I remember that, remember well. We were afraid maybe they wouldn’t let us come to New York any more. We didn’t -- because the war broke out, we didn’t know how -- how the United States would -- would react to it. Because I -- I remember the Saint Louis coming back to Antwerp, I was there.
  </p>
  <p id="1379">
   Q: Really?

  <p id="1403">
   Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty?

  <p id="1407">
   Q: What a journey.
  </p>
  <p id="1408">
   A: And -- yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. But what I also remember is that it -- it felt like -- like -- like a dream. Couldn’t believe it when we -- after -- after we were -- got settled in and -- in -- in New York.
  </p>
  <p id="1409">
   Q: Tell me what that first moment was --
  </p>
  <p id="1410">

  </p>
  <p id="1418">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember where they lived. I thought that -- that seemed like a palace to me --
  </p>
  <p id="1419">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1420">
   A: -- because we were ready to live anyplace, you know. It didn’t matter where. I remember they had sublet it, sublet several -- a couple of rooms from other refugees --
  </p>
  <p id="1421">
   Q: Mm.

  <p id="1431">
   Q: Did you learn English quickly?
  </p>
  <p id="1432">
   A: Guy did, a lot faster than I did, you know. I was sent to -- to a Jewish camp, also through a Jewish organization that -- when we first came that first summer, in Green County, I remember that, Green County, New York. And I was made counselor over the little kids, and they taught -- when I came home from camp, my English was pretty good. They taught me, yes.

  </p>
  <p id="1435">
   Q: You did.
  </p>
  <p id="1436">
   A: I felt strange, yes. Everything was different for me, nothing seemed, you know, natural. It was like in a -- well, like in a dream, you know, like things weren’t real. But --
  </p>
  <p id="1437">
   Q: Let me ask you this. For -- for two years -- I guess it’s almost two years, you are, in a way, the man of this little family of you and Guy.

   A: Should be mak -- made it easier for me. Should have made it easier for me.

   A: That she was able to come to Washington, and -- and go and see a senator. We had no means, and I’m sure when she got off the train in Washington, and wherever she stayed, that -- that she walked wherever. So -- but we did what had to be done.

New York, and I don’t -- I remember him going to a s -- someplace in Ohio, opened up a new store, or closed one down, something like that.

   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1488">
   A: It didn’t have extra classrooms for -- for refugees that -- that were help -- that were helped because they couldn’t speak the language. You either -- you either passed the -- passed the course or you didn’t. So at -- at first it was -- it was hard, but it was a good place to live.

  <p id="1556">
   Q: So they couldn’t make a distinction between German Jews and Nazis? [indecipherable]

  </p>
  <p id="1591">

  <p id="1592">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1593">
   A: And basic training was -- so many things that I forget. Basic training at first was tough and then it was easy, but there were a lot of German prisoners there.

  </p>
  <p id="1601">
   A: Well, I wasn’t happy about it, but I was happy that they -- there were PW’s at least, but they were st-still thought they were going to win. And then the basic training was cut short because they needed us over there. Was supposed to be, I don’t know, 17 -- 13 weeks of basic training, was cut short several weeks.
  </p>
  <p id="1602">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1603">
   A: We were supposed to get a seven day delay en route before we got shipped overseas and that was cut short. And I was foolish enough that they told us, take a troop train, don’t take a civilian train, take a troop train because they got preference, you going to get there --

  <p id="1604">
   Q: Right.
  </p>

  <p id="1606">
   Q: So were you late for wherever you were suppo --
  </p>

   A: Yeah. We -- there were some maps that I translated for him once and -- and were in -- in -- well, I wasn’t -- my -- my -- my German didn’t come in that -- all that han-handy, because -- cause at that time there were German -- Germans infiltrated our lines, dressed -- took uniforms from prisoners -- English speaking German soldiers infiltrated our lines, and we went out on patrol. When you come back from patrol, you never know where you -- where you end up.
  </p>
  <p id="1650">

And I parked it -- I still got the address, I parked it in Acha with a five gallon can of gas in it. But that was on my way, I had to leave for an -- for Antwerp, but I went through Koblenz -- went through Koblenz, you know --

Well, of course this was after the war already again, so they did wear -- anyway, I had a ma -- a major’s cap on. Twen -- I was all of 19 -- 20 --
  </p>
  <p id="1784">
   Q: Right.

  <p id="1785">
   A: But got away with it. Didn’t shave for a few days, and -- but I did get -- I went to Koblenz.
  </p>
  <p id="1786">
   Q: And you saw your house?
  </p>
  <p id="1787">
   A: Yes. That wasn’t -- well, 1t was -- the only wall that was still standing was in -- in -- in -- in -- was at the hou -- our house. One, the front wall was good, everything else was flattened. That whole town was --
  </p>
  <p id="1788">
   Q: Was -- was completely flattened.
  </p>
  <p id="1789">
   A: Was pretty well flat, yes. I went to see Hillis Hyam Stoney, a friend of my grandfather’s. He was a horse butcher, and he had a -- a klipa, a bar. I remember where he lived, you know. I went to see him. There was nothing standing there, and he invited me into his kitchen, there was no roof to his kitchen, you know. He -- he had bought our house before my parents left Germany, he bought the house with the -- that my -- m-my grandmother was supposed to -- she kept her -- her- the first floor was hers until she would die a natural death, of course. And I heard from Mrs. Teale, that’s the lady that I studied the history of Jews in Koblenz now, what -- that she had to leave there, even though the man, hillas -- hillas -- this Mr. Hillas Hyam fought tooth and nail, she said, you know, that she should stay. They wouldn’t let her stay. They brought all the remaining Jews together in one -- one place. But anyway, I -- I saw him, and then I tried to -- I asked, you know, are there any Jews left, and he told me about a -- a Mr. Pollak that had married a non-Jew, that survive -- that they never caught. I went to see him. I ha -- just had a short conversation with him, don’t remember what -- all I can ima -- I would imagine I must have asked what happened to everybody?
  </p>
  <p id="1790">
   Q: Right. Di -- had you known this person before, or was he a stranger?
  </p>
  <p id="1791">
   A: I -- I -- no, I didn't know him, I heard the name.
  </p>
  <p id="1792">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1793">
   A: Heard the name, but I -- I -- I didn’t know him. I didn’t see anybody else in Koblenz. That was shortly after the -- after the war --
  </p>
  <p id="1794">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1795">
   A: -- ended.
  </p>
  <p id="1796">
   Q: So you were discharged in ’46?
  </p>
  <p id="1797">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1798">
   Q: And then you go back to your parent’s house?

  </p>
  <p id="1802">
   Q: And Guy is 15?
  </p>
  <p id="1803">

  </p>
  <p id="1804">
   Q: Guy is sort of the age you were when you first became --
  </p>
  <p id="1805">
   A: Right, yeah, right, yeah, yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="1806">
   Q: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1807">
   A: -- yeah, yeah. Yeah, I -- I [indecipherable] when I went to sc -- when I went to school, first I went to George Washington high school, which was an academic school, and did a -- I wanted to learn a trade, and everybody thought it was a good idea. I went to machine and metal trade high school. I had a job after school, worked for Atlas Recording Machines, very all -- well known [indecipherable]. Mr. Kutner, a -- a German and a Syrian owned that place. Mr. Kutner, not -- he was not Jewish, not Jewish. He was a teacher at -- in -- in Berlin at the -- some technical institute. Very smart guy, and I went back there after the war, after I came home from -- from -- from the service, I went to work with them again, and I -- I was -- I liked it, and I wa -- I was probably pretty -- I was good at it. And there were several guys there, this -- this old guy, he was in his 40’s, he asked me to go into business with him, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1808">
   Q: This old guy in his 40’s?
  </p>
  <p id="1809">
   A: This old guy in his for -- in his 40’s. I didn’t -- by that time my father was not well any more, he had heart problems. Wanted to get out of the city the worst way, you know, and he wanted to do the same thing my uncles in Connecticut did, he wanted to be a farmer, a cattle dealer. And that’s -- he eventually, you know, bought a farm in upstate New York. First we looked in Pennsylvania, couldn’t afford it. At that time a lot of German Jewish refugees bought farms in -- in Vineland.
  </p>
  <p id="1810">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1811">
   A: Chicken farms.
  </p>
  <p id="1812">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1813">
   A: So by war’s end the -- the val -- the land value was already more than w-we could afford. We had -- we had saved 5,000 dollars. That’s a lot of money.
  </p>
  <p id="1814">
   Q: That’s a lot of money.
  </p>
  <p id="1815">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1816">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1817">
   A: And then we started to look in Pennsylvania, then we moved to -- further, further and further up. We finally wound up in -- in Norwich. I got a G.I. loan.
  </p>
  <p id="1818">
   Q: Did your mother want to move also?
  </p>
  <p id="1819">
   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1820">
   Q: She did?
  </p>
  <p id="1821">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1822">
   Q: So everybody did.
  </p>
  <p id="1823">
   A: Oh yes, yes, yes. Yes, and I --
  </p>
  <p id="1824">
   Q: But you didn’t get into cattle trading, you did something else in farming?
  </p>
  <p id="1825">
   A: Yes, Id -- I -- I -- I -- I dealt in cows.
  </p>
  <p id="1826">
   Q: But, for milk?
  </p>
  <p id="1827">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1828">
   Q: No?
  </p>
  <p id="1829">
   A: Well, yes, yes, I did -- we did both, we did both.
  </p>
  <p id="1830">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1831">
   A: We -- we -- we bought the farm. I -- I was the farmer, because from -- from New York, knowing that we were gonna buy a farm, I got a job on a farm in Monticello from Max Yasgur, and he taught me well.
  </p>
  <p id="1832">
   Q: How did you get that job?
  </p>
  <p id="1833">
   A: Through the Jewish agricultural society. They got in touch with Yasgur, apparently they knew him, you know, and he -- he hired me. I worked for him for three-quarters of a year and we were interested in several farms and he asked me to stay with him, he wanted me to go in business with him. I -- I worked hard, I wa -- I was young, and -- and I wasn't afraid to work.
  </p>
  <p id="1834">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1835">
   A: And I took to the work good, but we wanted to have our own farm.
  </p>
  <p id="1836">
   Q: Have your own, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1837">
   A: Yeah. And we saw several places that we were interested in, we finally bought the place in -- in Norwich.
  </p>
  <p id="1838">
   Q: Norwich.
  </p>
  <p id="1839">
   A: It wasn’t just what we wanted. We’ll s -- I always said, well, we’ll stay here for three, four years, and then I’ll buy a real farm. That’s 54 years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="1840">
   Q: Well, what’s the difference between Norwich and a real farm?
  </p>
  <p id="1841">
   A: And a real farm?
  </p>
  <p id="1842">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1843">
   A: Well, Norwich is -- 1s a little hilly. There’s in a -- N-Norwich itself is in a valley.
  </p>
  <p id="1844">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1845">
   A: So we have valley land and we have some hill land. I wanted one that was all in the valley --
  </p>
  <p id="1846">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1847">
   A: -- because when I worked for Max Yasgur, that was -- in Monticello, that’s all in the hills and- and I knew that wasn’t the -- that wasn’t a way to farm it. But we -- the first year we -- we just milked cows the first year. And then my f -- my father, of course, knew -- I didn’t know the cattle business. I knew -- by that time I knew how to work the land, how to milk a cow, how to raise crops, but after the first year my father started dealing in cows. One of the reasons we bought the farm in -- in -- in -- in Norwich is because it had a small Jewish community.
  </p>
  <p id="1848">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1849">
   A: And there were several Jewish cattle dealers there that my father knew from --
  </p>
  <p id="1850">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1851">
   A: -- from -- from Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="1852">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1853">
   A: And so we started dealing in cows, my brother and I. I -- I ran the farm, my brother helped. He was still in high school, but you know, he -- it -- it’s from 4:30 in the morning until -- until you’re done.
  </p>
  <p id="1854">
   Q: Yeah, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1855">
   A: Which might be nine o’clock, 10 o’clock, whatever time it 1s, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1856">
   Q: It’s tough work, isn’t it?
  </p>
  <p id="1857">
   A: Yes. And then he, at 6:30 he would go up and take a shower and get ready for school -- for the school bus. And then after he graduated school, he -- he was on the farm. We would go on the road every day, buy cows, sell them f -- make -- an-and milk cows. We started -- there were 20 -- 23 head on the farm, 23 head. I think eight -- 18 milkers and -- and five head of young stock, yeah. Within -- and -- and he didn’t cut a -- this guy that had the farm, Donald Davis, he didn’t cut enough hay -- didn’t cut enough hay for what he had. Within three or four years, we had 40 - 50 head, and then -- and we had more hay than -- than we needed, we sold hay. And -- but too bad my dad didn’t last long. He died in fift -- he bought the farm in ’48, and he died in 52.
  </p>
  <p id="1858">
   Q: Really.
  </p>
  <p id="1859">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1860">
   Q: That’s too bad.
  </p>
  <p id="1861">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1862">
   Q: And your mother lived with you --
  </p>
  <p id="1863">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1864">
   Q: -- through the whole period?
  </p>
  <p id="1865">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1866">
   Q: And you -- you met your wife in what -- you got married in ’56 -- no, *59.
  </p>
  <p id="1867">
   A: 759, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1868">
   Q: Right. And she’s from Norwich?
  </p>
  <p id="1869">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1870">
   Q: No? Where’d you meet her?
  </p>
  <p id="1871">
   A: A city girl.
  </p>
  <p id="1872">
   Q: Davina?
  </p>
  <p id="1873">
   A: Davina is a city girl.
  </p>
  <p id="1874">
   Q: What, New York city girl?
  </p>
  <p id="1875">
   A: Oh yeah, yes, from the Bronx.
  </p>
  <p id="1876">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1877">
   A: Bronx. She had an uncle in -- that worked for the Norwich pharmaceutical company in -- in Norwich, and she was visiting -- and he was a friend of my brother’s, Abe Middlemark, yes, Abe. And I -- I met her, and came to see a couple of times in New York, and got engaged, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1878">
   Q: After a couple of times? So fast?
  </p>
  <p id="1879">
   A: After -- well, I don’t know, after -- no, more. Probably --
  </p>
  <p id="1880">
   Q: Three or four times, maybe?
  </p>
  <p id="1881">
   A: Six.
  </p>
  <p id="1882">
   Q: Six.
  </p>
  <p id="1883">
   A: Better -- better than six months, you know the -- but of course, I couldn’t come to New York that often.
  </p>
  <p id="1884">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1885">
   A: Yeah, within a year we -- I think a year later we got married, yes. And it’s quite a change for a city girl --
  </p>
  <p id="1886">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1887">
   A: -- and I wasn’t -- I was ill -- ill at ease.
  </p>
  <p id="1888">
   Q: About whether she would adjust to this?
  </p>
  <p id="1889">
   A: That she would -- right, oh yes. And was quite a change for her. But I couldn’t marry al -- I had to marry the Jewish girl. There was just no two ways about that.
  </p>
  <p id="1890">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1891">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1892">
   Q: So you lived on this farm for over 50 years, you still have the farm?
  </p>
  <p id="1893">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1894">
   Q: But it’s now a driving range? Part of the farm?
  </p>
  <p id="1895">
   A: Well, I -- I sold the cows, yeah, sold the cows. Well, my brother left 1n -- my brother left the farm in ’69 -- ’68 -- °69. He a -- he had back problems.
  </p>
  <p id="1896">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1897">
   A: And he went to live in New Jersey, and I stayed on and I milked cows, dealt in cows, both, and raised a family.
  </p>
  <p id="1898">
   Q: Right. How many children?
  </p>
  <p id="1899">
   A: Three boys and a girl.
  </p>
  <p id="1900">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1901">
   A: And they decided not to follow in my footsteps, even though they -- they helped while they were going to school. They know all about farming, and all about cows. In fact my -- one of them wanted to become a veterinarian, my -- my Joe, but [indecipherable] he’s not -- he’s not going to st-stick around school that long, he’Il never do it. He would have made a -- you know there are veterinaries and there are veterinarians. This guy can look through an animal.
  </p>
  <p id="1902">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="1903">
   A: Yeah, he can look through an animal. But it didn’t -- he -- he di -- he -- he get sa -- he’s doing something else, yeah. My oldest one, he liked farming. They -- they all like -- they all like farming, they just don’t want to make a living that way.
  </p>
  <p id="1904">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1905">
   A: Because it’s -- it’s -- it’s too hard, there’s no money in it. Hard to raise a family, but my --
  </p>
  <p id="1906">
   Q: Is it hard to raise a family, why? Because you s -- have to [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1907">
   A: Be-Be-Because you don’t have -- you -- you -- you ki -- don’t have the means to do what -- what the city kids do.
  </p>
  <p id="1908">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1909">
   A: I mean, you know, with TV today, they -- they know how -- how easy it 1s f-for some people to make a living.
  </p>
  <p id="1910">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1911">
   A: And they all like for -- they like to be gentleman farmers.
  </p>
  <p id="1912">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1913">
   A: They like to have farms, and -- and -- and -- and land and -- and animals, and have somebody else do the work.
  </p>
  <p id="1914">
   Q: Else to the work, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1915">
   A: And they might get that chance yet.
  </p>
  <p id="1916">
   Q: But you’re glad you did this?
  </p>
  <p id="1917">
   A: I have no regrets, no, no, no. I could have very well -- I might have done something else --
  </p>
  <p id="1918">
   Q: Right.

   A: -- but as it turned out, I raised a great family.
  </p>
  <p id="1920">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1921">
   A: And Norwich was a nice place to live. The farm has still got me.
  </p>
  <p id="1922">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1923">
   A: They ask me if I’m still on the farm, and I always tell them, the farm has got me.

  <p id="1924">
   Q: With a -- with a 200 year old house, huh?
  </p>
  <p id="1925">
   A: [indecipherable] 200 year old house, yes, and new roads. When I moved there it was a dirt road, then in 1951 or two, they blacktopped it, and then they made it a little bit bigger a couple of times and they just finished it now, I got a superhighway now out there.
  </p>
  <p id="1926">
   Q: Oh, wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1927">
   A: Which I don’t like. Didn’t need it. But the government’s got so much money they got to spend it someplace.
  </p>
  <p id="1928">
   Q: I know when we talked throughout the last few hours, you said you really don’t know how this experience in Europe changed you. Do you -- do you ever feel surprised when you think back on what you did, you and your brother, that you were able to maneuver through all of this, or that’s not how you think?
  </p>
  <p id="1929">
   A: Makes me think like -- like not -- I’m not very religious, you know, I -- I’m very Jewish. I would say that’s my -- that’s my politics. God takes care of his fools, maybe. We were lucky somebody -- something, you know, when you realize what happened to all the rest over there, and -- and that we were so vulnerable.
  </p>
  <p id="1930">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1931">
   A: And -- and -- and still we -- we got out, so I’m -- I got a lot to be thankful for.
  </p>
  <p id="1932">
   Q: Right. Your mother was a kind of guardian an -- this amazing guardian angel, somehow.
  </p>
  <p id="1933">
   A: She --

   Q: Extraordinary.
  </p>
  <p id="1935">
   A: -- she -- oh yes, she did -- if anybody else I’d -- I’m -- we would not -- I don’t know if we would have survived it, but I know we wouldn’t have gotten to the United States when we did.

  <p id="1936">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1937">

   Q: And you.
  </p>
  <p id="1943">
   A: People [indecipherable] people --
  </p>
  <p id="1944">
   Q: Remember, you and your -- you and your brother are part of this, too.
  </p>
  <p id="1945">
   A: Well, we -- we -- we -- we did save our skin. But it’s a great country anyway, the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="1946">
   Q: You think so, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1947">
   A: Oh yeah, great country. Nobody complains more than I do, but a great country, yes, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1948">
   Q: Let me ask you a more contemporary question. Somebody who’s been through the experiences you were during the war, when you think about what’s happened here in the last six weeks, what happened on September 11", do you feel different than other Americans who never experienced anything?
  </p>
  <p id="1949">
   A: I -- you know, I -- I -- I thought I did. I thought Id -- that I feel differently.
  </p>
  <p id="1950">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="1951">
   A: But I listened to a couple of congressman the other day, I-I watch C-Span a lot, he feels just like I do. I think we make -- we make so many mistakes that I -- I say to my -- all -- all this didn’t ever happen --
  </p>
  <p id="1952">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1953">
   A: -- if they would have just done it right. If they only would have listened to me.
  </p>
  <p id="1954">
   Q: Of course. Are you frightened now?
  </p>
  <p id="1955">
   A: No, I’m not frightened.
  </p>
  <p id="1956">
   Q: No, you’re not frightened.
  </p>
  <p id="1957">
   A: I’m -- I am -- I don’t know what -- what would be the word for that? Apprehensive, is that the word for it? Maybe. Yeah, I mean, it’s a crazy world, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1958">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1959">
   A: [indecipherable]. But I’m -- I’m -- I’m not afraid, no. I watch my step, maybe, you know. But I -- I know my kids aren’t. I don’t -- I don’t think Davina is afraid. I don’t know anybody that’s afraid.
  </p>
  <p id="1960">
   Q: But everybody’s apprehensive?
  </p>
  <p id="1961">
   A: Oh sure.
  </p>
  <p id="1962">
   Q: Yeah, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1963">
   A: You should be. And I -- I -- I -- I -- I think we should be on guard a lot more than -- than we have been. Maybe now -- maybe now we sh -- Of course [indecipherable] fault -- fault our government. It’s easy for me to fault the government now, but it -- but I can understand too, why- why we -- because we c -- got away with it all these years, too. Got away with it, and -- an-and- and people lived -- don’t like to e -- use that word free. Everything was lax, you know, easygoing. But we found out we can’t do it.
  </p>
  <p id="1964">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1965">
   A: It’s not what’s wrong with the United States, it’s not -- it’s wrong with what everybody else is.
  </p>
  <p id="1966">
   Q: Everybody else is doing.
  </p>
  <p id="1967">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1968">
   Q: Is there anything you’d like to say about your experiences during the Holocaust that you haven’t talked about? Have we missed something?
  </p>
  <p id="1969">
   A: Oh, I’m sure we’ve missed lots. We missed lots.
  </p>
  <p id="1970">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1971">
   A: I know we missed a lot of the -- the horrible things that -- that happened in -- in -- in Europe, that the -- the -- the Germans and the Poles committed. And that it’s almost unbelievable, the things they did -- that they -- that they did. I realize that you can’t hol -- hold it against the -- against the -- the -- today’s generation, but what -- what they did in -- in -- in -- in between the years of ’33 and ’45, for a ci -- a civilized country to do that 1s unforgivable. Yeah, people -- people shouldn’t forget it, the -- the -- the things that human beings are capable of doing to other human beings. That’s all we still are is human beings, you know, and -- and -- and I think -- I think we should always watch out for that, we should keep on having that -- that kind of government that I always complain about here. But -- oh yeah. Because that’s what makes the difference. Atrocities that today that happen in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- sometimes that you hear about in Africa, terrible, and eastern Europe. But this -- this was government sponsored. It’s the government that was behind it too, not just by groups of -- just groups of people. Not that they can’t be -- can’t be just as cruel, these groups can be, but when a whole country, a government does that, it’s not good, yes.
