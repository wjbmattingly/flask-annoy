  <p id="43">
   A: Early on, yes, yeah, yeah. Let’s say until — let’s say 30 — as I recall, °36 - °37, we — not freely. I mean, there was always the fear of — of Nazi. We’d play Juden and so forth and so on. But we went to school in [indecipherable] to public school, he went to public school and I went to public school and they — there were a few Jewish children. There was another Jewish child — girl in my class. Boys and girls went to separate schools, and the — it — it was so-so. I mean, the other children greeted the fuehrer and so forth and so on and we — we were sitting, I mean Jewish — Jew children — Jewish children, we were sitting in the seats, we didn’t get up. Whatever, whatever, the — but the — but otherwise we were mostly together with other Jewish children.

  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: And did you —
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: No, he lost Polish citizenship. I think he left across the border illegally, or came to Germany illegally, or left Poland, or whatever. I — I don’t know exactly, but we were stateless, we were not Polish citizens.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: When you — when we first were talking earlier with your son, he mentioned that Constance is literally on the Swiss border.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: It is.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: You can walk back and forth.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: Right, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Before the war, do you remember being able to do this? Do you remember people being able to cross the border —
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Oh yes. Yes, we did.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: And was there a thought that your parents might try fleeing over the border into Switzerland’? August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: Switzerland was closed. I mean, if they didn’t — 1f they wouldn’t — wouldn’t accept Jewish refugees, very, very few. But they immigrate — to immigrate into — to Switzerland was quite impossible, apparently. But we did cross the border, was a — was one — one Jewish community for — at a certain time, but they became — as things became worse in Germany, the — the Jewish community in — in Switzerland [indecipherable] remained — remained by themselves.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: And they re — they remained intact, but in Constance the —
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: People started —
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: — people started to flee?
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: Yeah. People started immigrating to — to United States, to Argentina, to wherever. Where there was any — any opening to go to — to — at that time to Israel, which was Palestine at the time, if they were lucky enough to get there.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Tell me about your f— your recollections of Kristallnacht, the November pogroms of 1938.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: November pogrom, 1938, a — a — that’s very early they were — they came into the nac — I don’t recall. It was quite, quite early and they — two Gestapo came in, and they took my father, they went through the apartment, didn’t do that — that much damage, but they were looking for a — was later on my father mentioned the things, they were looking for literature, for books, which not — which were forbidden to August 7, 2009 read. And the — and so forth and so on, but then — but then when I woke up they had — they had just left with my father.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: They took your father with them?
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: They arrested him?
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: Do you know where they took him?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Gestapo headquarters, we — we assumed, and from there to Dachau. The — all — all the Jewish men were taken to — were arrested the same — that same night or morning, early mornings.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: How long was he in Dachau, do you know?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: He came back — I re — I recall he came back Hanukkah time, which must have been about four or six weeks later.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: So, just to clarify, he was arrested on Kristallnacht, which was November —
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: Just November 10.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: — ninth, 10".
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: Right
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Came back around Hanukkah, so perhaps he was detained for a month, or — August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: Sounds right. And then they started releasing peop — men and — slowly, with the provision that they would leave Germany within, I don’t remember was six weeks, or six months. I’m assuming it was six months because my father left in June of 1939.
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: How did they —
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: So they had to leave. They had to leave Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: How did he leave?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: He left — there was an opening — England had an opening for the a — as I recall, I — I think I’m correct about it, for men being released from — from the camps, there were other camps, Buchenwald was one of the camps, Sachsenhausen, there were other camps that they took the [indecipherable] men, the Jewish men there. And they — so England opened up for those men that were released, without their families, and the — they — there was a camp, called Kitchener camp in — in England, near London [| presume it was, that housed — housed the men. And the — my father tried, of course, to — the separation was supposed to be brief, but to bring us there, but war broke out in le-less than six months later and that — that was the end of that for us. August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: Back up a little bit, and just explain to me. He left in June of 1939, and at that point, had he — had your family tried to get on the quota to go to a different country?
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Oh yes, my — actually we had a very eva — to the United States. There was a — which we fell under the Polish quota, where my — my father was born, and it was a very — very — and I believe my father [indecipherable] qui-quite early with the American consulate, which was in Stuttgart, I believe. And the — but — but it was very slow, slow moving. It was a quota, so —
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: So he had applied for —
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: And we had — we had papers for the — my father’s cousin in New York who sent papers, but American consulate was slow in — in — in giving out papers — visas for families. Many of them — some of them made it, some of them don’t. Many, many did not.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: So you remained with your mother in and Leo after June of 1939 in Constance.
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: And how was the situation in Constance for you? Were you still going to school?
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: No. 1938 we — Jewish children couldn’t go to school any more. So also there were pe — many Jewish families had left already, and there were few Jewish August 7, 2009 children left, actually, and they — we didn’t go to school. There was a — the teacher and the — the cantor, he — they left for a — the U.S., and the — so, there was some [indecipherable] teaching there in the Hebrew school, but we were very — not too — not a great deal, put it this way.
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: How did you feel day to day? What was feeling in your household, what was the feeling [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Well, we were very — a — it was rather a desperate situation. W-We couldn’t — we didn’t get any more mail from my — from my father, we were cut off. Did get some mail from — to Switzerland. Somebody smuggled it in, or from — from a neighbor that we wrote to, but we were pretty much cut off.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: His business gone, taken from him.
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: Business gone, right, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: So what were you living on?
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: I don’t — I —I don’t know. There must have been a — there must have been a — some kind of a thing, because we — we did — I mean, we just existed, I mean, put it this way. My mother and Leo and myself.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: What did your mother do — do during this time period, just work on trying to get you out?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: Just trying to get us out. August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: And then — well, it was a — at an earlier time there were kindertransports, which I — I don’t know when they were, you know, the hope that we could leave as a family was always present, which you know, obviously has not come about.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: And when did it change for you again? What was the next thing that happened?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: A — well, the situation was quite — was in — quite desperate, I would say.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: It was —
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: And when the war broke out —
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: It was quite desperate?
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: Yes. And the — after war broke out, and well, in 1940, all the Jews from that area ca — bordering France were deported to Camp de Gurs in France.
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: This was October, 1940?
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: In October, that’s the — October 19 — 1940 — October 2274, 1940 was the day that the —
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: How did you travel from there to — from Constance to Camp de Gurs?
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: To Camp de Gurs it was, you know, a — I remember being places, but I don’t remember how — how I got there. This — some like a vague — vague memory of it. It was a train, I don’t remember if they have benches or anything. Did have benches, August 7, 2009 but a — along the side of the — of the wagons. But it was not — 1t was not the — you know, it was a regular train, actually. That kind.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: Were you with other Jewish — German Jewish refugees?
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: Yes, from the same town, right.
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   Q: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   A: Were deported from the — I don’t remember how many people were fe — from — from our town. And they — from the whole area which is called Baden-Pfalz, which was like here — here you would call it a state, or a subdivision that they wanted to make — make that area Judenra — Judenfrei. So the — the first — that was the first deportation from Germany, actual —
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: Can you translate what you mean?
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: To make it free of Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: When you were gathering things, because you were forced to leave, your mother and you and Leo, what did you do at the house, what —
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: We — oh, we lived already three families in one, Jews had to start living into one area, on one street. Anyhow, I suppose that was the — the plan to — to make it easier, I suppose. And we lived in — with another — with other three families in one large apartment, which I walked in, by the way, in May, when we were in Constance, which was pretty — quite traumatic, actually. August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: This past May”?
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: This past May, right.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: How did you feel, standing in the apartment?
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: A — difficult to describe. It’s — it’s — it’s still with me. So we were — Gestapo — again Gestapo came and the — un — unexpected, unexpected, I mean. But the to -- about 15 - 20 minutes, I remember one of them leaving, pushed Leo, says hurry up, hurry up, schnell, schnell. And we were taken out of the apartment with very small — whatever small baggage or luggage, whatever, whatever people took with. And we were assembled at, I think it was the [indecipherable] it was the train station. I don’t recall exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: Did you know where you were going?
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: No idea.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Did they tell you [indecipherable] France.
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: No, people — people did not know where we were going. I remember Leo talking and he — talking to someone — he was quite bright. He knew which direction we were going, but we didn’t know we were going east or west. So people are going — were hoping we’re going west, at least. And —
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: You arrived in Camp de Gurs in France.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: In France. August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: In the internment camp.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Describe your experiences when you first arrived.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: We were taken from the train, as I recall. We were taken from the trains onto camion — trucks. And the — we were pretty — from — from the same community, actually, we were together. And the — that was long way. I believe the Germans probably had an — had a — had — they don’t need the consent, but they — Vichy, France accepted, or had to accept the Jewish refugees from there. I don’t remember how many there were from the whole area [indecipherable] from larger cities. And there were quite a few — quite a few children actually there. In Constance there were not too many children, there was just Leo, myself and Hootie(ph) and another child was there actually, or teenager, in this — left in the city of Constance.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: So you — it took days to get to Camp de Gurs?
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: We — I-I don’t remem — probably two or three days, something like that, because we stopped, I think. As I learned later on, there was — we didn’t — Vichy, France didn’t want to accept us, and they — the Germans, you know, tried to — I mean Vichy didn’t have much chance there. So in — we went to the — got to the internment camp of Gurs, and it rained and it was miserable, and we were taken by truck, and then they — first, old men out to — so — so [indecipherable] Simon August 7, 2009 [indecipherable] was a cousin to my father, he Hootie’s(ph) — Hootie’s(ph) father, and they — I remember my mom saying please, please take care of my child, this I remember. And ... and Leo got off with the men, and we went on, and I was pretty desperate at that point. And then they had ilot in Gurs, separate ilots which were barbed wire with some of them double ba — between el — ilots, I think was double barbed wire, between the ilots. And with the French — first it was fr — I believe it was French army actually, then they changed to Vichy, to the Milice, which was the pr — Vichy — Vichy police, they were guarding us at the time. And the —

   A: Ilot means the — each separate entity that was surrounded by — by barbed wire.
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: So multiple barracks.
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: [indecipherable] an ilot was — I don’t know how many barracks was in each one.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: What did you — what were your impressions of the camp? August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: The camp? There was — well, it was in October, the — the mud was — people — people get mired into — into mud, couldn’t they — it — it was incredible. It was in the Pyrenees, and it rained continuously, and there was no — no — yeah, and the latrines, and the — 1-it — 1— I mean, was pretty unbearable conditions.

  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: And were — were they heated?
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: There was one small stove, one small heating stove. So who was lucky enough to get close to it was — was better [indecipherable]. I remember being next to a—a mother and a young girl, who didn’t sp — they spo — I don’t know what they spoke, August 7, 2009 either Spanish or Portuguese, but we just, you know, looked at each other and smiled at each other and she may — she may have been — she was ol-older at that time, she must have been a teenager, 15 at that time. And I remember sleeping next to her, and on the — the other side was my mother. And then they separated the chil — the — I don’t know if was voluntary, who did it, that they took children under 14 into separate barrack and they — but it was pretty voluntary. A — because the food that was distributed was more or less — they did try to give the children preference with food. But I do recall the Quakers, I mean, I think Quakers were very — were quite active in the — in — in Gurs actually. I don’t remember Rivesaltes, but Gurs they were quite active.

  <p id="156">
   Q: Can you describe how the — what the Quakers did in —
  </p>

  <p id="158">
   Q: What kind of things did you eat?
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: Oh, it was a sl — small slice of bread, which was divided. And the food itself was a — I remember the first few days when we came, the people of — there were some people there from — from Constance, too, who couldn’t eat it. So they gave the August 7, 2009 children, gave us the food. But you know, after a few days they become hungry too, and they — they actually ate the food.

And there was — there was a whole [indecipherable] people there from everywhere, from — from — you had people — you had people from Germany.

   Q: How did the different populations get along with each other?
  </p>

I — I wouldn’t — I wouldn’t remember it otherwise, like, you know, from the letters that the have — I have that. And the — so that we — we got to Rivesaltes. I don’t remember getting there, I don’t remember how we got there, or the — I remember walking a lot, but I— I don’t remember the — the trip. I — I August 7, 2009 —I don’t recall going from place to pla — I re — I know being there, but I can’t remember going from place to place.

  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: So once you were in Rivesaltes, what was Rivesaltes like?
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: How can you describe Rivesaltes? Number one, it was huge. The barracks were rabbit cage like, you know, first we were on the second floor. An incident I recall is they took young men to — again, Vichy police came. I suppose they had an order from the Germans for forced labor somewhere. And again my mother panicked, Leo came into the barrack and the —

And they took the men to we didn’t know August 7, 2009 where. Appar — some of them came back. Some of them came back and said they were building installation for the Germans in Normandy, which is interesting.
  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: And you were living in a barracks. Describe the barracks. Describe what the —

  <p id="249">
   A: Y-Yeah, well you know, it was really long time, the hunger was — hunger was a — one of the big, big problems. People went through garbage cans, I mean, a — and the — the barracks were — cause in Gurs there were wooden barracks, I believe [indecipherable] in there. I don’t remember any windows there either, by the way. But they — they had like, you know, rabbit cage kind. I think girls were sleeping on the — on the ground on straw, bags of straw.

   Q: Who were the other people in the barracks?

  <p id="257">
   A: Huh? It was a mixture of people, but there were many of them from you n — from — from — Jews from Germany that I remember primarily, and the others, I mean, we didn’t have that much contact with them and it was huge, I mean ba — I don’t know how many people it held.
  </p>

Or they put — somebody died at night in Gurs, by the way, they used to put — somebody died, they put him into the — the barrack where the — the [indecipherable] water, the fau — you know, th-they had water and the — some August 7, 2009 shower stalls, so they put the bodies there, which — which one of the kids were in the kids barracks [indecipherable] were going, ran into it early and there were, you know, the bodies of people, their bodies.

  <p id="266">
   Q: Do you recall seeing a cemetery in Gurs?

  </p>
  <p id="279">
   A: We were taken, at one point in Rivesaltes we were taken to a — yeah, it wasn’t forced, I mean it was, you know, they — they took people, I suppose the — the — the farmers around needed help for — to pick —

  <p id="280">
   Q: Harvest?
  </p>
  <p id="281">
   A: Huh?
  </p>
  <p id="282">
   Q: To harvest?
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   A: To harvest the grapes, I believe, and then they — the topinambur, which is sort of potato-like kind of — ugly kind of thing. So we were taken. We were together, which was actually — which — which was actually a relief to be out of the camp. And we — we were watched by Vichy police —
  </p>
  <p id="284">
   Q: Were you —
  </p>
  <p id="285">
   A: — and we did work early morning til ni— evening, but — but my mother mentioned — there was another family there, a Jewish family with — also with two children. And we were living in — 1n a end — sort of a cave-like thing, we lived 1n, with — with a big pot over a [indecipherable] fire. And the — that t-two — two mothers cooked, or whatever were they cooked. It was good, but — August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="286">
   Q: So let me clarify, you were — you weren’t leaving in the morning from Rivesaltes and coming home in the evening —
  </p>
  <p id="287">
   A: No, no, we were out —
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   Q: — you were living at the farm.
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   A: We were out — we — right, we were living on — I don’t remember where we were living, but it was a—I don’t recall exactly, but I remember it was cave-like.
  </p>
  <p id="290">
   Q: How long did this — how long did this —
  </p>
  <p id="291">
   A: I don’t remember, but it was — it was a relief to be away from the camp.
  </p>
  <p id="292">
   Q: How was — how were the —
  </p>
  <p id="293">
   A: Because food was — 1-1t wasn’t plentiful, but — but 1-1t was there, and there together with — my mother and Leo was there together with the other family, the same thing. I don’t remember sleeping conditions there, how it went. But, you know, it’s called vendanges, which means to — the — the — the grape harvest — harvesting — grape harvesting and something else, was potatoes or whatever it was. Potatoes didn’t exist in southern France altogether, didn’t see a potato.
  </p>
  <p id="294">
   Q: How did — I mean — so, at this point, you’re living, you’re doing — you’re leaving to do some harvesting, you’re coming — you went back to Rivesaltes.
  </p>
  <p id="295">
   A: Back to — we were taken back to Rivesaltes.
  </p>
  <p id="296">
   Q: And while you were out at the farm, did you interact at all with just French — August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="297">
   A: Yeah, Leo spoke a little French, which he learned in s — in school [indecipherable]. But they didn’t speak fr — they didn’t speak — it wasn’t French, it was Catalan, which is the — the language between Spain and the — Spain and France. So they spoke — they didn’t — don’t remember them speaking French, but like I say, it was Catalan, it’s a language that’s a mixture of a — so, we didn’t interact with them, just we — we harvested, we worked.
  </p>
  <p id="298">
   Q: So you didn’t feel like there was — you didn’t have any chance to even know [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="299">
   A: Flee, or to go, or it was — yeah, now in — in retrospect think maybe we were probably not far from the Spanish border, but we had — didn’t have a chance to get away.
  </p>
  <p id="300">
   Q: And in retrospect —
  </p>
  <p id="301">
   A: Or maybe could have, maybe — I — I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="302">
   Q: Also in retrospect, could these people have helped hide — hide the Jews, hide some of the Jews?
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   A: They — this — you couldn’t underst — they couldn’t understand us — we couldn’t — first of all, we only spoke German, by the way. Didn’t speak French. Leo spoke a few high school — high school French, but that’s all [indecipherable] I — I think it was just a— a woman with a child or two children our age. August 7, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   Q: And so — and when you’re 14, I believe, in 1940 — you were in Rivesaltes until when? When were you in Rivesaltes until?
  </p>
  <p id="305">
