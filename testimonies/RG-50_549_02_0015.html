   Question: This is tape one of an interview with Hanne Leibmann in her home in Bayside, Queens, for the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum. And the interviewer is Joe Richmond. Let’s start -- let’s start going all the way back, just talking about your family a little bit. Just tell me briefly who was in your family, your -- Hanne Leibmann: In my family at what time? At what point of time?
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Q: Before the war, when you were growing up. HL: When I was growing up, okay, how far do we go back?
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: As far as you want to go back. HL: Well, I was born in 1924 and you have that on some of the tapes already. And at the time I was born, I obviously had a mother. I had a father, I had a brother three and a half years older. However, my father died in 1925, about three months after I was born, so I grew up in a one parent household, okay? My fath -- my mother maintained my father’s business, which was a photo studio, okay. At the time my father passed away, we still had an art gallery as well, which my mother gave up around 1926, because she could not maintain a business and an art gallery and two children and everything else. Besides, at that point in Germany, after the inflation, the art business was not the hottest item anyway. So I grew up like any other child, okay. My mother had several sisters. She had three that lived in the city where I was born. She had a -- equally a brother who lived in
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   Q: Did you mention your brothers and sisters? HL: My brother -- I had only one brother, three and a half years older, as I said and well, we grew up like all children do, I suppose. I remember the rise of Hitler, I remember the street fights in the 20’s. Our place was next to a left wing newspaper and there were a lot of street fights and shootings and flag burnings. And these are some of my earliest childhood memories. Included in that is the people who came begging for food to our apartment door. Carts going through the street, horse drawn carts going through the street, collecting clothes for the poor. It was a very, very bad time in Germany. Hitler came to power, I remember April one 1s the boycott. I remember that very well. Went to school, public school. There was some harassment, obviously there was harassment of a - of us kids in the street. I did not have Gentile girlfriends, probably, after 1935, because it became too dangerous for them, as well as for us. And my mother had Gentile friends t- to the very end. Til the day we were deported, we had Gentile friends who came to our house at night, in the dark, when it was, you know, what do you call it? Brown out here? Black-out? Black-out, really. And school, of course, for us Jewish kids, we had to leave public school in 1936 and go to an all Jewish school. Many of the larger cities already had established Jewish schools -- long established Jewish schools. Karlsruhe did not, so
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: Let me sto -- w-what was your brother’s name? HL: My brother’s name was Alex. His full name was Alexander. Okay, but he was referred to as Alex.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q: And your maiden name was Hiss -- Hiss -- HL: Hirsch, yeah. October 22nd we were deported. We were the second deportation out of Germany, the first one having been from Stettin to Lublin in February of 1940. Of course, previously, in °38, the Polish - Jewish people who had lived in Germany had been deported to Poland. And that was this miserable situation, they did not have a qua -- they didn’t have -- they had not acquired German citizenship and the Polish government said,
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: Did you know at that point on the train, did you know -- did you know -- HL: Where we were going?
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   Q: Where you were going, what was happening, [indecipherable] be? HL: Not at all. Most people did not know. My mother and I knew that we were going to the south of France. And we knew, because the morning of the deportation, my mother sent me to a Mrs. Fite, okay? These were very decent people. And my mother was friendly with them to the very last. And she told me to bring them certain items from our household which they very much liked. It was Bohemian glass, it was very -- a crystal, it was very beautiful stuff. And she said, “Go over there, bring it to them and come right back.” And so I did and when I came to Mrs. Fite, she told me, “My husband said you will be going to the south of France.” But of course we didn’t know, what does it mean the south of France? Where were we going to be, right? And I came home and told my mother and she said, “You crazy.” Okay”? Because she fully expect to be -- expected to be taken to a concentration camp in Germany or even to Poland, because we knew already from the people who had been deported from Stettin, that they were taken to Lublin. So our expectations were not the south of France and my mother said, “You’re [indecipherable]. We did go to France, but what was going to happen to us -- I mean it was very obvious once the train went, you know, was set in motion and we were going west, that we were not going to go -- let’s say Dachau, which is in Germany or any of the other camps, right? And indeed, we were taken to France. And on the train we were allowed to take with us 100 marks. Our money was changed into French francs. We got 2000 French francs for the 100 marks, which was a pittance. So the trip took three days
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: Most of what I know is from your -- 1s from your interviews. So tell -- so tell me in your -- in your experience. HL: My experience, well, like everybody who got there, six and a half thousand people got there, was utter confusion. Totally -- most of the people were totally traumatized. Understandably so, right? First of all the three -- three day trip. Then we were taken off the train in open trucks, in pouring rain. From the railroad station in Orlong San Marie, to Gurs is about 15 kilometers. Not terribly far, right? But enough to be thoroughly soaked. The camp itself was built on a land that had been completely deforested. There were no trees. There are trees today, but that’s 50 years or 60 years later. And the ground was mud. It was real mud, like -- clay-like sort. And of course, with the rain, this became an impossible situation. So here we came to the place already, we stepped right into the mud, right? The barracks were totally empty. They were wooden structures, only tarpaper, no windows. There were no windows. We had flaps that could be opened, but you had to prop them up. Now if you opened the window -- so-called window, right, it would rain in. You closed it, you were without air and light. Had a door on each end -- at each end and -- there comes my husband -- and --
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q: Pll stop the tape for a -- we’re back. So yeah, just the -- the daily life and the conditions [indecipherable] talking about.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: So -- so, did you -- HL: I don’t think there are many camps or you have ever heard that people would -- sometimes it was a struggle to get people to really pay up, you know, their -- whatever percentages it was, I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   Q: So it was sort -- it was a self government, essentially. HL: It was -- a c-certain amount of it was self-government, definitely. Each block -- now the camp had -- was divided by one main road on each side of the main road, where
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: And you said -- you said, “We instituted this system.” HL: We instituted that system.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   Q: Again that was -- that was a system that -- that you had [indecipherable] HL: Yeah, but this -- this system had to be approved by the administration. On holidays, when there was a holiday, you could -- could get out of your block and circulate and
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: So you describe an admin-administration that was fairly hands off, that just HL: It was not entirely hands off. When it came to cultural things they -- they were all with it, because that’s the way the French are, right? There was no problem. You have to ask my husband, because he worked more in the office than I did. I worked in the office in our block. But he was -- in his block he also worked in the office, he was more involved than I was. My job was more of giving out the mail, running, you know, giving out the mail that came. Run the errands, do some statistical work, things like that, you know. Anyway, life in camp was very, very hard. I would not say it was life like you hear about from Auschwitz or any of the other camps. No, that 1t wasn’t. It was tough, nevertheless. Once you are a prisoner, you’re a prisoner. So we didn’t have to stand in formation, okay? This did not exist. We were counted, however, in the morning. There was a woman who came through the barracks every morning to count us. God forbid if she overlooked a small child, because we had some small children with us and you know how it is, children go always under the blanket, right and she didn’t see them. She was miscount and then she was -- she was just horrible, you know. Screaming, stamping her feet and -- I mean it was just terrible. Totally unnecessary. There were some escapes. Some were on -- people were unfortunately caught and brought back. Others made it, that depended on if you had contacts outside, if you spoke the language, if you had money, you knew where you were going. Most of us -- only some young people tried from our
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   Q: Did you live with your mother at that time and other relatives [indecipherable] HL: In -- in Gurs?
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: In Gurs. HL: Yes, with my mother and my three aunts. The first few months I think we were in the same barracks and then my mother and I were shifted over to another barracks, but we were just a couple of -- what, maybe 50 meters, you know, something like that. So that was not a problem.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   Q: And communication an-and information? HL: Between us? Between the people in each block? Constant communication. What did people have to do other than talk? I mean, let’s face it. My cousin was in the same block, my -- that was the daughter of my mother’s brother. Her mother was in the same block. Cousins of my mother were in the same block, right? As long as they were female. The males were all in separate blocks. So there was constant communication between us and the other people. Also many times fights. Bread -- distributing the bread. Cutting it into portions, because you got the whole loaf, usually was the flashpoint for a fight. Some
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Okay, this is side B of tape one, interview with Hanne Leibmann. Okay, you were saying about the social service agencies? HL: Do you know my name is misspelled?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   Q: Oh, it’s misspelled? HL: It’s L-1-e.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Yeah. We’ll -- we’ll fix that on here. It’s spelled about three different ways on these forms so, we’ll make sure it’s the right one. HL: Possibly with a P too. The social service agencies were very helpful to us. And indeed one day a social worker came to my mother and asked me whether she would let me go out of the camp to a village called Le Chambon. And by now you must have heard about Le Chambon. There was a concerted effort to get the children and young people out of the camp and they started with the younger ones first, because they were in greater danger. Danger of malnutrition, danger of -- you know, I mean the whole thing. So this y- young lady from the OC came around and asked whether she would let me go to that
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   Q: How long had you been in the camp at that point? HL: At the point I left -- well, we got to the -- we were arrested on the 22nd of October and arrived in Gurs on the 25th, 1940. I left the camp on the seventh of September, 1941. So, 11 months, little more than -- whatever. More or less. We were four boys and three girls to leave and we came to Le Chambon and that was the most marvelous experience anyone could have had, ever. I don’t know if you have seen the documentary, “Weapons of the Spirit’? Well, you have to see it to understand what I’m talking about. We were placed in a home that was run by the Swiss Red Cross, children’s division. We were quite well taken care of, under the circumstances. France was very hungry, they had very little to eat and even so, we were in the country surrounded by farmers, these farmers were very poor. We had enough to eat, with the exception of one or two of the boys who were growing like weed and you know how teenagers can eat, like non-stop, 24 hours. However, we were free. We were in wonderful surroundings, people who appreciated us. It was a flip-flop from Germany. It was a total flip-flop from Germany. After having been persecuted, discriminated against, segregated out of society, right? We now where the people -- that we are wanted, right? And no difference was made between the French and
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: And before you went, how many Jews do you think -- HL: Live in Chambon today?
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   Q: No. Were there at that ttme? How many were being hidden? HL: The official number is 5000 people. Among the 5000 were Christian people who were persecuted, okay, for one reason or another. Being that they were German Gentiles who had fled into France because of political reasons. People who had become Protestant but were of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth -- we had a friend like that. She was in Le Chambon and she was in a Protestant home. We had all sorts of people. The number of 5000 is the accepted number today by the papers, the false papers that were issued in the village and the surrounding area. People came, stayed, got their papers, went on. Because once they had the false identification papers, especially with the French Jews, could maneuver, okay? So, if you figure 5000 people, or approximately 5000, to a popu -- equal population of about 5000, this is a tremendous
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: Before we talk about -- HL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   Q: Your -- your -- about going to Switzerland, tell me h-how you met your husband. You met in -- in the camp. HL: We met in the camp, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: How did that happen? What hap -- do you --
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   Q: How did you maintain a courtship, though, in that situation like that, in the camp? HL: How -- courtship. I don’t even think it was a courtship. It was a friendship, really. You know young people are sort of drawn together -- yes I fell in love with him, of course I did. I would be foolish to say not, that I didn’t, right? But it was a totally platonic thing. There was very little privacy, right? Most of the time people saw us with his mother. Some even thought we were brother and sister. You know, I mean it -- s- some others, maybe they found some privacy or were looking for it. We weren’t. And -- you know, I speak -- I speak in schools and colleges to the students about this time. And I mention my boyfriend became my husband. And not too long ago, in one class at Queensboro Community College, one girl in the question and answer session said, “I don’t know how you could look for a man under these circumstances.” I corrected her that I was not looking for a man, that 1s was totally platonic, which she couldn’t understand, right? It was almost funny, you know. So -- we kept a cor -- kept up a correspondence after I left. It’s as simple as that. I always knew where he was, when he
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: I guess the wi -- 1n a situation like that, you think that there are both advantages and disadvantages to -- to having a new relationship, whether it’s a friendship or a boyfriend - to [indecipherable | HL: Or a girlfriend, or whatever.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   Q: Or a girlfriend, you know, to hav -- that there -- you know, there are certain advantages in having a close companion and certain fears. HL: There is an advantage to having someone, yes, especially if you’re in the same situation, because you’re each other’s support. The same as when you’re a group of people. Like we were seven young people, right? We were each other’s support. There is no doubt about it. And it made things easier for us, right -- than being alone. If you’re totally alone, without having this support, right -- it is much more difficult. One of my friends, who came from the camp with me, eventually, after I had left, split from the group. I’m not quite sure why she split. We assume she had a boyfriend somewheres. And she split from the group. And I think she -- in that time that she had left the group, until the end of the war, she suffered more psychological damages than any of us did.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Did you maintain, or do you still maintain contact with other people in this group? HL: All of them. All -- all but -- well, one lives in Brazil, I don’t actually have contact with him, but with his twin brother in Paris. One -- we know he came here to this country and we have lost track of him. And all the others, yes, of course. Absolutely.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   Q: Can you say -- can you say some of their names, just [indecipherable] HL: Well, there is Elizabeth Koenig, nee Kauffman, she was with us. She did not come from Gurs, but she came to us in Le Chambon. She was, by the way, the chief librarian of the Holocaust Museum, til she became too ill and had to retire. There is Wiltrud Lavell, nee Eanee. She lives partly here in the States and partly in Spain. There 1s Jack Lewin, who lives right here, out in Long Island. There is Rudy Appel, who was not originally from Gurs, but came from Rivesaltes. The Atlas boys. Yeah, we all have contact with one another, absolutely. And we wouldn’t miss it for the world. It took us a long time to even get together, because somewheres along the line we lost each other, because everybody -- you know, after they emigrated here, we didn’t all come at the same time. Jack Lewin,
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Let’s come back to that a little bit later. L-Let’s keep going on talking about y-you made -- how you made it into Switzerland. HL: How I made it into Switzerland? I went on my own.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   Q: And -- and -- and -- and why? You -- you -- you [indecipherable | HL: I just felt -- well, there were two reasons. First of all, Max had gone there, he was there already. I had made up my mind after I saw my mother being deported that I was not going to stay in France, no matter how safe in Chambon. I just felt -- and I had family in -- in -- in Switzerland. So my -- I was focused on Switzerland. One of my friends who lives out in Palo Alto, who came with Max from the Jewish boyscout farm outside of Lyon, we had arguments. He said, “You go to Switzerland, you go in a mousetrap. Something happens, you are lost there. Come with me, we go to Spain.” I said, “I’m not going to Spain, I go to Switzerland.” So we had arguments back and forth. He went exactly to Spain, with the help of the French underground, Madame Philip. His way was Spain, North Africa, England, joined the French army in England and came marching back into France. He then lived again for sometime in France and then came here to the United States. So, yes we did have arguments whether we do go to Spain. And from there on, or to Switzerland. So I chose Switzerland. And my trip to Switzerland, well, I went
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Okay, this is tape two, side A, interview with Hanne Leibmann, once again. So we’re talking about your escape into Switzerland. HL: My escape into Switzerland -- as I walked along the road, I saw this custom’s office, as I mentioned before and I walked past and the officer called me back and asked for my papers, which I gave him. And he looked at them and then out of the blue came, “Are you Jewish?” Question I was not prepared for at all. And just as quickly, I answered, in good Nazi propaganda -- and don’t ask me where it came from, I simply said, “I have nothing to do with this dirty race.” And he sort of had a ha-half smile on his face and said, “Okay, you can go.” Whether he believed me or not, I don’t know, but he let me go. And I walked on and made my way to the priest of the village, the Catholic priests, which was one of my contact points. And he told me to what house I had to go to meet the man who would help me cross the border. This man was hired by my relatives in Switzerland to cross me over. He was paid for the job. There were a family there with two boys and later on a single young man whom they had found in the church [indecipherable] the story was and he wanted to cross over into Switzerland. So this night he crossed over six people. He took us -- actually, he was very close to the border. What he did was carry across -- carry us across the water. There was a little stream. He carried us across so we wouldn’t get wet. Told us exactly what direction to walk -- now please, this isn’t -- during the night, in the dark. In what direction to walk to get the street car that would
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   Q: Do you remember his name? HL: No, not at all. If I ever really knew it. Or if I knew a name, it might not have been his real name, I mean you had to have lots of safeguards. In Anisee when I got off the train, I had to show my papers, right? And police looked at it and said, “Go on.” You know, there was no problem. There were a lot of people and [indecipherable] you know. We reached a street car -- we had a few Swiss coins, which the man had given us -- the passeur had given us and he told us where to get off, and there would be a person standing there waiting for us, taking us to a little hotel for the night. And that’s what happened. We got off at that point. I don’t remember what the station was from the streetcar. There was a young lady standing there and she took us to this hotel, which didn’t ask for any registration or anything. They must have been, obviously, paid off. And in the morning she came and picked us up, took us to her house -- to her apartment, gave us a breakfast. And I had asked her, as soon as I got off the streetcar, I said, “Please call my family immediately.” “Oh, it’s 11:30 at night.” I said, “Please, call immediately.”
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Let me just go back a little bit. HL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   Q: You said that you had found out that your -- your mother had died. When did you find out and how did you find out after [indecipherable] HL: Look, when my mother was deported and we had this hour or so together, she -- my mother was a realist. She told me she would never come back, that this was the last trip, that they were certainly going to be taken east and somehow people had a sense for what was going to happen to them. And so, you know, news filtered into Switzerland in ‘43, slowly and surely and there was no doubt in my mind that this is what happened. Besides, my mother had diabetes and I never even thought she would make it as far as -- as Auschwitz, which she did, unfortunately. In this case, unfortunately [indecipherable]. So, to me it was a sure thing.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Were you ever able to find a [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   Q: So you felt that whole time that -- HL: That my mother was lost, absolutely.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Were you able later on to find out any information about what happened? HL: She was indeed -- she made it as far as Aus-Auschwitz and she was killed in Auschwitz. Because I looked into the Gedenk book, you know what that is? That’s a memorial book that the German government publishes with all the names of German Jews that were killed. There’s some mistakes in the book, however, essentially, you can find what you need to find. You can -- the museum has the book. You ask for it up in the library, they have it. So, to me, that -- there was -- we knew. There was no doubt in our mind, especially people of a certain age. When I saw my mother last, she had already lost so much weight. I’d never seen my mother that skinny in her whole life. So how much resistance was there left? So living with my relatives was not a good experience, not at all. I left them on December 24th and I mention that date because my uncle was Protestant, my aunt always remained Jewish and was a member of the Jewish community, but he was Protestant, and so Christmas, of course was celebrated because their sons were raised as Protestants. And my cousin, her middle son, threatened her that unless I was out of the house, he would not come for Christmas. And I had already been in negotiations with Geneva, where Max was taking a social service course -- to get a job there and the only job I could get was as a maid. And Mademoiselle DeMomela was the
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   Q: When -- when and why did you decide to -- to leave Switzerland and come to the United States? HL: Switzerland made it very clear to you that you better go on. My husband had a cousin in Switzerland, had a clothing factory for men -- men’s clothing. And he could have used him very much, to help him in the factory, in the office and so on and so forth. And so he asked for permission for us to stay, for him to work. And so the little village said, oh well, if the contone, which is like the state, right? We’ll go along with that, this is fine. Then the contone said well, if the federal government will permit it. And the federal government turned around and said, when the -- if the contone will permit it. And wa -- you know what it became? A catch 22. And I said, “Forget it, we go to America.” I had family here, right? Max had family in Israel, however this was not an option for us. And s
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Why not? HL: We just felt we didn’t want to go to Israel. We just felt that was not the place we would want to be. And --
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   Q: W-W-Why? HL: I don’t know whether it actually had to do something with his aunt -- it prob -- aunt and uncle, really, because they were not willing to -- to do anything for him, even before we were deported. You have to ask him exactly what went on. And they were not
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: And what happened when you first arrived?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   Q: Wh-What was his job?
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: This is tape two, side B, interview with Hanne Leibmann. And you were just talking about -- h-how long were you sick for, actually, with TB?
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   Q: How old was your daughter when you -- when she [indecipherable] HL: Came back? Almost seven.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: So that must have been very hard. HL: It was very hard. You have to find your way back. It’s really -- you know, a relationship has been -- not totally cut of course, but still -- we could see her -- after the first year we could see her every three months, I think. But a couple of hours is not much, right? We would call her every Sunday, 12 o’clock sharp. She knew 12 o’clock on
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   Q: How did -- how did your experiences during the war affect the way that you sort of saw yourself as -- as a mother or an -- an -- you know, here in the United States, how did- how did that -- you know, color the way that you -- HL: You mean, did our daughter know what happened to us, did we tell her what happened to us? We didn’t. Well, she asked me one day, “Why don’t I have grandparents?” And she must have been about 10, something like that. And that was an unexpected question really, because I’d never thought of it. And I told her, “Your grandparents were killed in a concentration camp.” Now that was a little much for a child, I know that now. I didn’t realize it at the time. And then she didn’t say anything any more. And my two aunts were sort of stand in grandmothers, right? She heard us talk about Gurs, definitely. She heard me talk to my aunts when we were talking about things in the past. So she always knew this, but we didn’t push it. We did not say to her, like I know from other mothers, “You have to be very good, because of what happened to us.” Mm-mm. We did not say, “You cannot go here or there,” right? “You cannot have this or that, because we didn’t have that you can be without.” You know. She wanted to go out as a teenager or when she went to college, she went to Adelphi. And she wanted to go at night to the city, on Saturday night like all young people. We never said, “You cannot do that.” I know parents who would not let their children do that. Simply because they felt, “We didn’t have it. We had to do without that.” They had no understanding for a normal life of a teenager, right? And they wouldn’t let their children have it. And they really -- a
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: And why do you think they have these problems? HL: Because of the parents, really because the parents were overprotective. I have friends who outright say, “Yes, we were overprotective of our children. We wouldn’t let them do this and that and the other thing and we always worried where they were and what they did.” And we just didn’t do that. Or if we worried, we didn’t tell her, and let her -- you know. One night my husband and I had a terrific fight. Why? Because Evelyn decided, with her girlfriend, to go to the city to a hangout. And this hangout was perfectly fine, there was nothing wrong, but it was snowing. It was snowing very heavily. And he -- she wanted to go with the car, obviously, from Jackson Heights. I said, “Go take the car. Go.” And he was upset that in the snow I let her drive and go to city. “This 1s too dangerous,” this is this, this is that. I said, “You know what? She wants to do it. If she gets stuck, she has to find a way to come home.” She did. I didn’t say you can’t go, it’s too dangerous, or this or that or the next thing. We let -- I let her go, he was -- he was upset about it. But I felt that, she’s a young person, she has to find out what she can do, what she can not do. And we never stopped her from whatever she wanted to do because maybe we’re too afraid of it.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   Q: When she got older, did you talk to her more and more about your experiences? HL: Well, she always knew some of them and eventually -- when we gave the interview to the museum, | think it was, she listened to the tape. I said, “Well?” She said, “Well, I
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Do you think that you felt differently or taught her differently about things like religion or being Jewish, based on your experiences? HL: She had -- she went to Sunday school for a year or two. We are not a religious home, right? We are more cultural Jews than religious Jews. Yes, we do observe the holidays, right? We will have Passover and we will have people here for Passover or -- for Passover or for Rosh Hashanah or whatever, right? Yes, we had Hanukah but we are not, as such, religious people. She knows very well where she belongs, okay’? There’s no question about that. But to me, you know, it is by far more important that someone 1s a good human being, over being very religious and maybe not such a good person. One doesn’t exclude the other, but you know, to me it’s more important.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   Q: What -- what do you think may have -- what do you think’s been changed by your experiences during the war in terms of that -- in terms of the way you see religion or being Jewish? I mean, is th -- are there things that you can -- HL: I have never been ashamed of being Jewish, I was always so proud of being Jewish. I would never have entertained the thought of conversion of any kind. And by the way, in Le Chambon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert us, right? That was an absolute taboo. Would have been very easy for these people to persuade us, right?
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Have you gone back there at all? HL: To where?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   Q: To either France or Switzerland? HL: Oh, to the village? To Le Chambon? Many times. And I must tell you that when I go there, I feel very much at home. I know few people, right, as such. The people that I sort of knew have all passed on. But there’s just something about the place that -- well, I feel very much at home. We have not gone back to Gurs, no. By the way, there is nothing standing of the camp, there is only the cemetery, which has been totally redone, partly or entirely with money from Germany. And moneys that were raised otherwise, I suppose, but it’s totally redone, it doesn’t look anything like what it originally was. It’s like -- now like a nice military cemetery. So --
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: You were talking about this group that you were -- that you were with there and then you sort of maintained contact with -- HL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   Q: -- over the years. When you first came to the United States, was that important, to find people who had been through the war and had similar experiences? Or has it been more important [indecipherable] HL: Well, we found many of our friends here, again, friends from before this total experience, you know, having be deported, Gurs and so on. Most of them, my husband’s, some mine. Yeah, it was important to find our friends again. That was definitely important to us. Many had other experiences. I have friends who went into England with the kinder transport and I found them here again. Others came directly from Germany to here. Others had been in Switzerland. Yeah, it’s important to have your friends and friends with whom you share a past. There is sort of an unspoken, you know, connection. You know, you don’t have to explain to this person how you feel about a certain thing or a situation or in -- what it was in the past. You don’t have to do that, they know. The ones who don’t know, are the ones who don’t even want to know. Or didn’t want to know when we first came. When we first came, we were with one of my husband’s friends and they said something and Max says, “Well, I had to go across the Alps -- not the Alps, but through the mountains.” And the way we came here and so on and [indecipherable] so he sort of made a funny joke about a very sad situation and they really didn’t want to know. And this is the complaint of all survivors, that the people really didn’t want to know. And then I come across American Jewish people, “Oh, we didn’t know what went on.” “You didn’t know what went on, when it was daily in the newspapers? Didn’t you read them?” I mean there -- we have volumes of paper clippings from the New York Times, over here
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: That one of the reasons that -- HL: The survivors did not talk for so long. They couldn’t and they knew that other people had no -- no understanding, didn’t really want to know. I spoke in a school in Staten Island several weeks ago. Jewish school. Not a yeshiva, but a Jewish school. On the line of maybe Hamas. You know Hamas school? They are a wonderful school, Jewish school in the middle of the city, have highly intelligent children there and a wonderful staff of teachers. And this 1s run -- there are boys and girls, so it’s not, you know. But we wear long skirts and long sleeves and -- religious. I was over there and I spoke to about 100 children. And then I asked, “How many of you have grandparents that are survivors?” And I would say 70 percent of the kids there had grandparents that were survivors. And I asked them, “What did your grandparents tell you?” Nothing. Nothing. “My grandparents don’t talk about it.” I said, “Go back to your grandparents, make them talk to you and tell you.” I said, “If you are supposed to remember the Shoah,
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   Q: Why do you think the grandparents aren’t -- aren’t telling their story? HL: I don’t know. They should tell their grandchildren. You have this opposite, the ones who don’t talk and the others who pile it on. Literally. And put a great burden on these children. It is almost a burden the way they do it. So you have these two opposites.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Do you feel like your experience has been different as a survivor, having been married to another survivor? HL: You will find most survivors being married to other survivors.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   Q: But in your case, you actually had such similar experiences all the way through -- through the war. HL: Yeah, and many people met in the DP camps in Germany or even knew each other at one point or another in the ghettos. Many of them got married in the ghetto, were lucky to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Can you explain in your experience why that -- why that’s been so -- HL: I think again because people were comfortable with each other, not necessarily because they were terribly in love, but because they wanted someone, right? Someone with the similar experience who understands what this was all about, right? And because they wanted a family. And I don’t think there were many divorces among these survivor marriages. Many of the people already had lost a family. Had lost a wife or a husband
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   Q: Is there anything else that you want to [indecipherable] HL: No, not really.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: Post war experiences? HL: No.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   Q: No? HL: Not really. At war’s end -- when the war was over. The day it was announced on the radio and I listened to the speech of King George and I just understood enough English to understand what he was saying. We were in a refugee home in Shesare, where we had this horrible woman in charge of the home. I must tell you, I felt totally drained. It was a beautiful, sunny day. And here were the Alps in full sunshine and I felt totally drained. It was not hooray the war was over. We had lost everyone and everything. The last one to die was my brother in 1945 in the Battle of the Bulge. So we felt drained. There was no jubilation. Not a -- for any of us. You would think people would have been totally happy and s -- no. Mm-mm. In fact, we have a picture somewheres -- this woman in that home, in that refugee home, found it in her heart to say, “Well, the war is over, let’s have in the afternoon, something special. Let’s have some coffee and cake outdoors on the verandah.” And so we did, and picture was taken and everybody looks glum. That was the hooray, hooray, you know. So, I think maybe you would want to speak to Max.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: I would like to speak to Max.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   Q: But, recent years has been easier? HL: Recent years have been good, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: Well, thank you so much -- HL: Eventually.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   Q: For talking, 1t was wonderful. HL: Eventually I did go to work, but I cannot [indecipherable] that officially.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Shall I turn this off? HL: Yeah. End of Tape Two, Side B
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   Q: -- tape three, and the beginning of the interview with Max Leibmann. And the interviewers name is Joe Richmond. So let’s start just -- let’s review your childhood that- talking about your brothers and sisters, their names and ages. ML: I -- no, I don’t have brothers and sisters, I was an only child. Was born in Mannheim, Germany. I had a perfectly normal, middle class childhood and I started school in -- after [indecipherable] 1928. I switched schools in 1932, meaning that in Germany you normally completed either f-four years of public school and then went into high school, or if you did not qualify for high school, you continued for four more years of public school, then became an apprentice and went to school twice a week in the afternoon. So I switched schools. After four years I went into the -- a high school called Grayagunasium, which meant that in the first year we had Latin, and Latin continued of course, throughout school. In the third year we added French. So we had Latin and French and in the fourth year we had Latin, French and English. The difference between my high school and a gimnasium was, that in the gimnasium, you would learn Latin first, then they would add Greek and as a third language I think they added French. But the Greek was meant particularly for students who would become either lawyers or doctors.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: In your -- in your upbringing, though, you -- was it a religious household, was it -- ML: No. We were not -- we were not religious. I mean, we knew we were Jewish. My father was very active in the Jewish community, in fact he was an elected official to the -- let us call it lower house. And he was requested, I think in 1935 or 1936 to join the
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   Q: [inaudible] And how old were you when -- when you were deported?
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: What can you tell me about that? ML: Slow. Let’s step back first.
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   Q: Okay, okay. ML: Let’s go back to Kristallnacht first. We had moved, in order to preserve money, because no inco -- there was no more income, we had given up our own apartment and moved in-into the apartment with my grandmother. My grandmother happened to have been a French citizen. And the house my grandmother owned had a ba -- a loft 1n the back, where there was a Jewish firm which sold electrical fixtures. On Krist -- on -- on -- not on Kristallnacht -- during the day when they started smashing everywhere, they also came into my grandmother’s house and went into the back in the loft and had a field day with smashing all these electrical fixtures which were stored [indecipherable] hanging, etcetera, but my mother had enough presence of mind to call the French consulate. Because, after all, this was a Fr -- a French possession, this was not German property. And the consulate called the police and within 10 or 15 minutes after these hoodlums had entered th-the loft, there was a uniformed brown shirt, who pulled everybody out and stood guard the whole day so that nothing would -- would happen to my grandmother’s apartment, because after all, she was a foreign citizen. That’s -- our apartment was -- was whole, was never smashed. When the war broke out, of course, with mobilization, we also had to report to the military, but we are immediately discharged as not fit for service as being Jews. Mustered out. And the next thing we knew 1s I was drafted for the first
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: You can speak up. HL: Oh. I can?
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   Q: Yeah, go ahead.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: So you knew that you were being deported the next day? ML: I knew, but I were -- we weren’t -- I --
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   Q: Did you know anything else? Did you know where you were going to go, how [indecipherable | ML: No, all -- all we knew is that we would be sent away to France. That’s all we knew. Now, the Gestapo, or rather the SS, left the trains at the so-called demarcation line. The demarcation line was that part of France which was occupied and th -- and the -- the other part was unoccupied. The -- the -- the Germans left, the train went on to Lyon and I happened to have been in the first train which went to France. There were seven trains all together, I was the first train -- in the first train with my mother. And it so happened that in my car was a former German officer of World War One and somehow or other he caught the attention of the SS and they came to him and said, “You are the transport chief.” He didn’t ask for it, he didn’t want it, but you are the transport chief. So when the- when we arrived in Lyon and the French gendarmerie, the French police wanted to
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Were you able to maintain contact with your mother at that point? ML: Yes, we were able to con -- to maintain contact -- con -- contact with our relatives. There was a system where the so-called block administration was issued little tickets -- I don’t remember how many -- which permitted you to go to visit, maybe one hour every so many days. I don’t recall the details. I was somewhat more fortunate because I had office skills, so I very soon made my way into they office and I worked in the office. So I had privileges. I could go more often to my mother and then eventually we were also
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   Q: T-T-Tell me how you met your wife. ML: My wife was a runner in the block. HL: [inaudible] message. ML: A messenger where my mother worked in the office. She was the principle -- my mother was the principle clerk in -- in the block where she was located and my wife served as a messenger. There was mail to be distributed, there was mail to be picked up, so the youngsters, you know, th -- see u-us youngsters adapted much better to these brutal conditions than the -- the -- the -- the grown-ups. And you have to visualize that the so-called streets within the blocks were earth, and when it rained hard -- and it rained hard there very often in this region, it was tho -- for -- about 25 miles or 20 miles north of the Spanish border. Sees -- the ground turned to mud. Now you have to realize, I had riding boots and with my riding boots when it rained, I would sink in almost up to the top of the riding boots, into this mud, which meant that we had at least one or two deaths of pe -- old people who had to go to the latrines at night, fell and couldn’t get out -- and couldn’t get up. Was one -- I think it was one woman. The food we got was between four and 600 calories a day. Not only was it very limited, but it was also established later that
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: You both talked a little bit about how it was [indecipherable] a self government -- government system -- ML: Well, each block --
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   Q: H-How did that work, yeah. ML: -- each block had a so-called blo-block aldist, a vice block aldist and an office. You know, in -- in every 0 -- camp, you have to keep track of numbers, you have to keep -- for food rations, you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens, whatever we got. We got -- we got -- the bread was assigned so we had to count. There were constant reports to be made, that’s why there was an office. HL: Excuse me. I mentioned before there were constant statistics to be made. You have to report the people who die, right? ML: And we soon had deaths, because the old people died like flies. HL: Just a moment. I brought you here what I usually take to --
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: You’re still remembering good details. ML: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   Q: Tell me how you -- how it came about that you left the camp. ML: Well, let’s finish with the camp first.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: Okay. ML: Eventually, and I’m sorry to say this, it became evident to the French su-supervisors that the so-called two block aldist of our camp were more corrupt than other block aldist. And so one day they decided to dissolve our block, to stage an example for the others. And while this was going on, one day, shortly before the exodus started, where people were distributed to the other blocks. And actually, they probably did this also because they had moved a certain amount of people, transferred a certain amount of people to other camps. So one day, the supervisor of our block stood in front of me and said, “I want you to do something for me. I want you to do the inventory of what you are giving back to us.” You know, blankets, etcetera, kitchen stuff. So I did this. Was be a lot of
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   Q: Wh-What happened one week later?
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: This is tape three, side B, continuing the interview with Max Leibmann. ML: Yeah, the -- the -- this facility was run by a French chemist and two rabbis who had managed to get from the -- the camp where I was in Gurs, to this farm. And unfortunately for me, it was an orthodox -- it was run along very Orthodox lines. The chemist, a -- a Frederick Hammer -- or Hamel was Orthodox, as were the rabbis. So I was in this farm
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   Q: Because you were not -- ML: Because we were not religious. And so the young fellow was much yo -- was a few years younger than | and I -- I said to him, “I’m going to join Hanne or to try to find Hanne,” and so the next morning we set out and went up to Le Chambon. We arrived at - Hanne had told me how to get there, so that was not a problem. And the problem was
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: Before you go onto that, at this time, y -- did you know -- first of all, did you know where Hanne was? ML: Yeah, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   Q: And did you have any sense of how often these raids would come [indecipherable] ML: No, we didn’t know anything. Nobody knew. Hanne was somewhere else.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: You -- you had to stay hidden the whole time? ML: I was hidden two or three weeks. And -- but they took me back. The first thing they did is they photographed me. They explained to me, “We will get you false papers now and then we will help you to escape to Switzerland.” And I think there were four of us who went to -- who were helped escape to Switzerland, I think we were the first group, because we went by railroad from Le Chambon to a village in the French Alps. I believe it was a Sta -- I don’t remember the station where we went to, but I believe it was the station one station before Seshaway, which to this day is a major vacation point in -- in the French Alps. And there there was a 10 year old who picked us up. He knew we were coming apparently, his father sent him. He took us to the house of his father, where we stayed overnight and we met there also a young, French pastor who would go with us part of the way the next day, because he was supposed to learn how to get people across
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   Q: You were traveling by yourself at this point, or still with [indecipherable] ML: No, I was -- had -- this -- with this other fellow. And so he cautioned us, “Don’t go into an express train, because the express trains are being patrolled by a military police.” So we took a local train, it wasn’t that far, into Lausanne and in Lausanne I went -- after some moments of hesitation, I didn’t know where to go, I said to myself, “You are a Jew, go to the Jewish congregation.” There I went to a telephone, looked up the address of the Jewish congregation of Lausanne, which was -- which happened to be within half a block of the railroad station. And then we went there and when we explained to them that we -- we are refugees, just came into Switzerland, they told us, “Look, welcome to Switzerland. We have to turn you over to the military, but we can promise you that you will not be returned anywhere.” We didn’t tell them that we were already once returned. And this is how I got first into Switzerland. So, they picked the -- somebody came with a car, I think and picked us up and took us to one barrack in the park in -- in -- in a suburb of Lausanne, where we spent the night. We were interrogated there. And fortunately the interrogator was a Swiss -- a Swiss speaking fren -- a French speaking Swiss -- Switzer -- Swiss military who did not understand German, so I translated for the other guy, who didn’t speak French -- for my companion. And I translated the way I wanted to translate, not what he necessarily had said. And from there we were taken to a so-called quarantine
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Okay, when you say quarantine, do you -- were these -- were these like DP camps, were they interment camps? Were they -- ML: No, no. That was -- everything in quarantine was military control. We were guarded by military personnel and this is the first -- where we first -- and everything in Mouton where I was and then in Appensel, this was military control. Everything was military. Btu the military -- that was now German Swiss, not French Swiss any more, they took us out every day on a walk. With the gun -- bayonet on the gun, you know. And we started an argument with the company commander or the platoon commander -- we explained to him there is absolutely no reason to guard us with guns, because where does he think we can go? Does he think we are escaping Germany or escaping elsewhere? We cannot go anywhere. So w-we eventually prevailed and this -- the Swiss soldiers walked with us,
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   Q: Now at that point, did you entertain thoughts about not reporting to the -- to the labor camp? Did you have any sense of what the labor camp would be like?
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: So the way you describe it, that there were no guards -- ML: No.
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   Q: You were getting paid, although a small amount -- ML: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: How was it different from maybe just having had a job? I mean why -- what -- what -- ML: Well --
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   Q: What made it feel like a labor camp? ML: Number one, in the labor camp you did physical work, or if you were in these refugee homes, the homes had to be maintained. So I happened to be in the office, but the other people -- there were people that were working the kitchens, there were people who had to clean the house.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: Were they -- were there bad conditions? ML: No, there were no bad conditions. Number one, in all of these facilities, every six weeks, we were entitled to a pass. We would get a free railroad ticket anywhere you wanted to go, if you had some money to go, but the railroad ticket was free. You had your pocket money. The food was not luxurious and not -- not gourmet food, but it was totally adequate. I mean you weren’t hungry. Not withstanding what many people claim,
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   Q: Who was in the facilities? Who were -- who were in the [indecipherable] was it mostly Jews, was it many refugees -- ML: Th-Th-There were mostly Jews, but we were in some facilities later on, after I was married, where we had Gentile political refugees. For instance, in the labor camp, we had a German doctor who was a political refugee. And in fact, I got sick. I had hepatitis and this man absolutely did not want me to go in the hospital because he didn’t trust the Swiss, that they would feed me properly, because I had to be on a diet. In those days, you know, I could -- no -- ee -- I didn’t get any meat. I was permitted bread, I was permitted a jam, I was permitted some cheese and liquids. And he didn’t trust them to give me what I should have gotten because of rationing. So, in the camp, it doesn’t matter if one person gets more from one thing and less from something else, so he kept me for two or three weeks in the sick bay, until was able -- until I was recovering and could back -- go back to work. So --
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: Tell me how -- how you got back in touch with Hanne and how [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   Q: It -- it seems like 1t would have been difficult just to -- for her letters to find you and -- and [indecipherable] ML: No, she knew where I was. I wrote her immediately when I got to -- End of Tape Three, Side B
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Okay, this is tape four, side A, we’re continuing the interview with Max Leibmann. You -- we were just talking about getting back in touch with Hanne once you were in Switzerland in the labor camps. ML: That was not a problem, because we corresponded already when I was in the camp and she was still in France. And the mail worked miraculously, quite well. And once she was in -- in -- in Switzerland, I saw her every six weeks. And now, you want me to go through this again, with -- with a -- all of it, because this 1s all on the [indecipherable] tape.
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   Q: Yeah, well maybe -- let’s move ahead to what happened when -- when the war was over. ML: When the war was over, that was very simple. We had nowhere to go. We di -- we knew we didn’t want to go back to Germany, even though, I don’t know if Hanne mentioned that in her tape, I was released from the facility I was in, to participate in the social service course in Geneva. And while I was in Geneva, one day, I was contacted by a -- a Mr. Bauer. He would like to meet with Hanne and me -- we were not married yet, but Hanne happened to be in Geneva already and I was in Geneva, so he invited us one afternoon for a cup of tea. And that was very in -- a very interesting conversation. The -- I di -- wasn’t quite sure if the man was a left wing Socialist, or if he was really a Communist. But the purpose of the conversation was to try to entice us to go back to Germany when the war was over, because it would people -- it wou -- they would need
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: Wh-What was his name? Do you remember? ML: Bauer. I don’t know his first name. So that was -- and after I finished his soci -- service calls, I went back to internment. We got married at the same time in Geneva and then Hanne joined me in -- in camp. I got permission to -- she got permission to come with me into camp, for which we had to pay, by the way. They charged me the same amount of what the Swiss personnel had to pay. And so we were in -- in Switzerland until we were able to obtain an -- an affidavit to come to the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   Q: What were the interment camps like at that point, after the war? ML: They had not changed. That was -- we were -- I was not in a camp, I was in a home for families. And these homes had not sh -- that were -- has not -- they did not change
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Were there other place you considered going? ML: No, we had nowhere to go. HL: Well, excuse me, we were talking about Israel [indecipherable] ML: We were talking about Israel, but this was another sore point. My parents -- I had an- an uncle and an aunt who went in 1934 already, to what was then Palestine, with money. They left Germany at the time because they -- their money basically was in
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   Q: Do you remember when you first got here, what -- what you -- what you felt? ML: Well, it was, you know, we had to -- it was a strange country. And we came with at- a two year old child, our daughter. And -- HL: What did we feel when we came here? ML: Bewildered. HL: Bewildered.
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: I sh -- I wonder if you can move over a little bit, or -- and I could -- HL: I would say we were somewhat bewildered, maybe also the feelings that we had -- okay -- we were somewhat bewildered.

   Q: Will you tell me about your first job? ML: First job was f -- f -- with an -- HL: Import [indecipherable] ML: Import - export outfit and I worked in the office. I didn’t know anything, my English was limited. And I didn’t last there very long, they fired me pretty soon. HL: Uh-uh, you got sick. ML: Oh, yeah. HL: That’s why they fired you. You got sick with your knee. ML: I’m -- I got sick with -- I had a problem with my knee, I couldn’t walk, so they fired me. And I was in bed, I think 10 days or two weeks. HL: Whatever. ML: Then I got another job. And from then on I worked. Until of course, in 19 -- in November of 1950, I got sick like my wife with TB. HL: 1950. ML: 50, that’s what I said. I said ‘50. HL: Okay, sorry. ML: I -- I got sick in November of 1950 with TB and our daughter had to go to a foster home and we went into a sanitori1um. And I was in there I think 18 months and my wife was in there 21 months. And when I came out, I was on what was called half-time,

   Q: Just to remind where -- ML: Yeah, where we --
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: [indecipherable] talking about buying a house. ML: Yeah. So eventually, it became time to buy a house and we started to really scout around. That was 22 years ago and you know, when you buy a house -- when you buy a house the first time, you have all kinds of ideas what you want and slowly, as you start shopping, you know what you don’t want. So y-you go by elimination til you find something which you think is suitable. So we ended up here, where we are now. That was 22 -- HL: It’s 23 years ago. ML: 23 years that we have the house.

  <p id="119">
   Q: So, we’ve talked -- Hanne and I have talked a little bit about just how your experiences during the war have sort of affected maybe the -- the -- the type of parents you’ve been and the type of people you’ve been in terms of -- ML: Well, look, we’ve --
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: -- and the kind of choices you’ve made.
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   Q: Is there any reason why, before 1983 or before this -- this time period, that -- that you weren’t involved or maybe weren’t -- I mean, did you talk about it amongst -- amongst yourselves? HL: Ourselves to get involved, well our f -- as I mentioned, our first involvement came through the book. ML: Yeah, we looked -- we were, to start out with, busy making a living. My wife worked, I worked. Our daughter was growing up. She eventually, in 1967 graduated -- no, in 1963 graduated high school and went to college. So we were busy making a living.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Y-Your friend now and then, as well? HL: Yeah. ML: Yeah. The -- look -- bo -- some -- one of my friends I went to school with, started in second grade. We are still friends. Our wives got along when we came here, so we, you know, just continued. There are people like this on -- on my wife’s side. So, there was -- we have a -- a Gentile friend who once said to us, “You are an incestuous society.” We mostly get together with -- with our friends from Germany and since I am working at the American gathering, of course, we have other -- we made other friends, which are all survivors. And what was interesting 1s, I found when we talked for the first time to
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   Q: When -- when -- HL: But we are friends just the same with all of them. ML: Yeah, in fact -- HL: We have a vast circle of friends.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: And how many of these people who -- who aren’t your survivor friends, how many of them know that you are a survivor [indecipherable] ML: Oh, I made no -- I made no -- HL: All of them. ML: All of them. HL: All of them. ML: I make no bones about it. I don’t hide.
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   Q: And how -- how many of them are curious and ask you stories and -- ML: Well, if you --
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: [indecipherable] converse with them about it. HL: Very few. ML: Very few. Look, our -- those of -- of our friends who came here in the 30’s really didn’t want to know about our experiences either, when we came. That was a taboo subject. They didn’t want to know, they didn’t want to face it. They were lucky, they came here in time. And some of them to this day really haven’t ask us much about our experiences during this period.
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   Q: How does that make you feel?
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: This is tape four, side B and we’re continuing the interview with Max and Hanne Leibmann. We were just talking about the people who came before the war, how did they- how they can’t comprehend these -- the -- the experiences of a survivor. ML: Look, basically those who came before the war, moved to America. They didn’t have the experiences we had. Most of them came even before Crystal Night and those
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   Q: Well, let me ask you this. You said that -- that no one who didn’t go through those experiences can comprehend. So, what do you then do? Do you try to tell your story and make them comprehend -- ML: No --
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: -- or do you just -- ML: We have never -- we have never -- HL: Well, I --
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   Q: Or -- or -- or, a-as it seems that you’ve done, you’ve -- you’ve -- you’ve preferred to -- to socialize with people who have those sort of experiences [indecipherable | ML: No, we’ve socialized with our -- HL: [indecipherable] socialize -- M: -- fr -- w-we socialized with both groups, but with our friends, we never imposed the - or forced them to listen to our story. They didn’t want to -- didn’t want to listen, fine. HL: In the beginning, they didn’t want to listen. They know now, some of the -- some of it. It is really never a topic of conversation as such. We might speak of the Holocaust in general, right? But the personal thing never really becomes a topic of conversation, or very little. The people who came here were Max’s, well they just moved here, yell -- yes, they moved here. They had their own problems when they came here in the 30’s. There

  <p id="132">
   Q: Has that been a part of your marriage, that sort of [indecipherable] HL: I don’t think so. ML: No. It hasn’t. HL: I don’t think so.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   Q: So you don’t talk with each other about your stories? ML: No, no. HL: No, because the story’s --
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: They were the s -- they were the same story.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   Q: Well, let me ask you this. At -- at this point, you look back on that history and you have a -- you have certain stories that you know and that you tell, that you tell in schools or -- are there still times when you remember new things that -- that all of a sudden you’ ll remember something or that isn’t part of the story that you usually tell? You want to hold on for a second? ML: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: [indecipherable] HL: Yes, the -- a few weeks ago -- you know, I speak in schools. And I tell them of the day when we were deported and what went on. ML: And she speaks without notes.
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   Q: It was [indecipherable] HL: Mm-hm. Sometimes --
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: She’s [indecipherable] HL: You know, sometimes there are small details that you don’t -- ML: You miss. HL: -- you miss. You miss them. Sometimes it’s a manner of not having enough time to go into details when I speak. Sometimes you really -- you know, like I did not tell you when you -- we were speaking here, when you interviewed me, about my grandmother on the train. I mentioned that she lost her mind, that she was totally -- the kids would say she lost it. So this -- this Mr. Wile that you have here on your notes, well, at one point, after the SS had gotten off the train in Shalons Urson, we were able to get the one doctor that

  <p id="139">
   Q: [indecipherable] things that you even have forgotten about for 40 years yourself and then, you know, come back to you sort of later in life then as you’re -- HL: Not really. ML: Not really. HL: Some people do say you have a marvelous memory, but I don't know whether it’s such a good memory as having absorbed everything, you know, that went on in -- or as much as I could absorb as a child. Yeah, there are things like, I don’t usually talk about when one day in a nice summer day and the doors to the balconies in our dining room were wide open. And in the street, a bunch of Hitler youths were marching and they were singing one of their horrible things, that when the Jewish blood jumps off the edge of the knife, things will be twice as good. And my father got up and went out on the balcony and watched them marching by. And I became totally hysterical, right? Because I thought
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: What sort of notions? ML: Well, you know the questions -- they wanted to hear certain things and we didn’t play ball with this. There is always -- we had -- we had -- the only thing I can think of right now is -- and this has come again and again -- what -- what -- the questions was, “In Le Chambon, what prompted these people to help?” And they thought this was -- I don’t know what. And we tried to explain to them that when you -- when they helped, it was a spontaneous and they might not have known 10 minutes ago that they would help, because th -- th -- 1t’s a question didn’t come up. You know, they did this for religious reasons, for moral reasons, but one didn’t know from the other, there was no organization
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   Q: Did you go back and visit there? ML: Oh yeah, we were there a number of times. We even participated at their first symposium -- historic-historical symposium where they were trying to put things together in an orderly fashion, with historians and there was a controversy which was very interesting. There was a historian who researched this, a young French Ph.D., who stood up and said -- there were 150 people -- 150 Jewish young people who were in this village. The man was almost lynched, because what he found was, the 150 -- HL: [inaudible] it’s 50 - 50. ML: Oh, 50 people. He found the 50 people are registered in -- in police documents who were Officially registered as living in a forced residence in Le Chambon. That there was something going on. All along during the war where people came and went and were fitted with false papers, never entered his -- his brain. The man was almost lynched and -- and was called a revisionist and God knows what. Because he took the number -- he

  <p id="142">
   Q: Did you ever think 20 years ago or however many years ago that you would be so involved with -- ML: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   Q: -- doing that sort of thing now? ML: Because we are so far removed from organized religion that it never occurred it -- to us. And we were too busy. We never belonged -- we belonged for three or four months to a Jewish congregation and our daughter went for a few weeks to Sunday school. Other than that -- HL: She went two -- one or two weeks. ML: Other than that, we never belonged to an organized congregation or anything. HL: We are not joiners. ML: We are not joiners, we are not religious, we don’t practice. That doesn’t mean we are not Jews. I mean, we may not be Jews in the eyes of the Orthodox, the ultra- Orthodox. But nobody ask us if we were religious or not religious when we were deported.
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: So why then do you think you’re so involved now with hearing people’s stories and -- and [indecipherable] and being part of the gathering and -- ML: That ts -- HL: I think one has to give something back to society. ML: To society, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   Q: I -- HL: Do you speak any Yiddish?
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: Only a few words. HL: Oh.
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   Q: But I wanted to show you this. It’s the one -- the museum sent me this, which I thought was interesting, this is Netanyahu and he says, “This is the lesson of the Holocaust, this and only this. That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish sovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.” ML: Yeah, but this Jewish faith, of course is somewhat neb -- in my book nebulous because the ultra-Orthodox in Israel don’t serve in the army. They don’t even recognize, per se, the state of Israel. HL: [indecipherable] Israel. ML: [indecipherable] these people don’t want the state.
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   Q: But this 1s a st -- ML: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   Q: -- a very specific sort of lesson of the Holocaust. I wonder, you know, if you have your own sort of idea of what the lesson 1s. ML: The lesson is remember, teach so that it will never be forgotten. HL: Teach tolerance. Teach understanding. This is what I ask of the children, to get to know each other. To understand and respect each other. Because if that all breaks down, then you get hatred. And hatred, we cannot live with that. Many times the children ask me, “Do you hate?” And I will ask them, “Do you know what hate does?” And they look at me. I said, “Do you know who gets hurt first when you hate? It’s you yourself, because your soul dies. Before the other guy knows that you hate him, you are already destroyed.” And they look at me and then they start thinking about it. So I’m not only telling them what happened to me, but I’m trying to tell them what they have to do and what they have to learn and the consequences they have, you know, if things go wrong. ML: And you know, one of the functions I have in the American gathering is I act, actually as an ombudsman on behalf of survivors, vis a vis of the claims conference. Many people can’t get what they think they should get -- a pension, for whatever reason. There are many restrictions why they cannot get it. And the personnel of the claims conference, 1s basically Russian. With a -- to us totally alien mentality, in Russia, I always say, in Russia, y -- a social service is -- is not social service, civil servants are not there for you. You are there for civil servants. And that is the attitude which you get
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add about -- ML: No. I think we have talked long enough.
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   Q: Okay. Well, thank you so much. It’s been wonderful. All right. HL: You’re welcome.
