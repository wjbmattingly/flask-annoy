   Q: Let's start with where you were born and your names at birth and now. Let's start with you Irene. I: I was born in Teplice Sanov in Czechoslovakia in the year 1937, and I was named Renate Guttmann, and I'm now Irene Hizme.
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Q: Now what was the date? I: 1937.
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: No, the month? I: Sorry, December 21. R: I was born at the same time, half hour later. My name then was René Guttmann and today is René Slotkin.
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   Q: Now you were very young during these early years of the Nazi oppression and persecution, but I really would like to see what it is that you remember as far back as you can go. Do you remember those first few years where? You were born in Teplice Sanov, but you didn't live there for very long? I: No. We moved to Prague and were there for a while. R: My earliest memories of being alive go to that apartment building in Prague. It was maybe a like five or six story building brick with a yard and a fence. I remember a staircase leading up to our apartment so we had to be somewhere up. I: Yeah, I think we were on the upper floor. R: Upper floors, and I do remember falling once and I have an injury here, which I haven't thought about in a long time, but I must have stitches underneath my chin. I still remember the burning sensation of what I guess was iodine, was the first aid that I got for that. But I do remember that apartment building. Those are my earliest, very earliest memories, my first memories.
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: You slept in the same crib? R: I don't remember doing that. I: Either in the same crib or right next or our cribs were like touching. My recollection really is, and I know I've told you this once before, that our mother, when she would put us to sleep she played a game with us, there was a game. She would set our hands and we always wanted our bodies to be set a certain way to see if we could stay that way all night long and wake up in that same position. So I remember that. R: This is incredible. I'm learning this. I never heard this. I: I remember that, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q: Did she make up this game or did you make it up? I: I'm not sure. R: I would think it had to be her, but that's interesting.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: What other recollections? Do you remember playing outside? Do you remember the people around you? I: I don't remember the people around us so much, but I know that once René — there was a yard in front with grass and René was out there playing. I think he stepped on a bumblebee and he got bitten and I think that was — R: That was a big impression made on me. As a matter fact, I had itches underneath on that foot even when I came to the States, which was in 1950. I always get an itch on the one, but I could never understand. But I do remember that incident. I put it together. I don't know whether it's a real physiological phenomena or just my mind playing tricks on me. But, yeah. I remember the grass. I: You know, I also remember, do you remember that we had like conductor outfits and punching tickets to go on the train and we used to play train, train conductors? R: Well, that brings to mind, I think there was a tram or something that ran near us. I: In front of the house. R: Number 22. I: Twenty-two, right. R: I wouldn't know it was 22 until now, but it looked like two twos, so now we know it's a 22. I: That was one of our favorite games. I think we also — I remember we had some kind of car that we could sit in and drive. I don't — we used to race, but you used to beat me all the time. R: See, she's older, obviously —she remembers these things. I: I remember one particular time we used to go — our parents took us to the park. There was a park nearby. And we used to go quite a bit, but the one time that I remember especially was right after a major storm and a lot of trees had fallen and we were walking on the logs, trying to balance, and I think— R: That must be the same storm that I'm talking about except I saw it from upstairs. We must have gone down. I: I think we went down. I remember that, there's something about the air. You know you how sometimes that smell — it brings it back, even today, sometimes I'm out and I get a certain smell and it says — that's the park. Also, I remember that we had — I'm not sure whether it was trucks or what, but some kind of toys that we could pull, like little wooden something. And we also had wooden little blocks, tiny little blocks, and you were very good at making.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   Q: Do you remember your parents? R: I don't, I really don't. I've tried and even I've had visual aids since, I've gotten some pictures of them, but it still doesn't seem to help. I've tried to really. There's just one moment that I remember that happened much later with my mom that I remember, but not at that point in time. I: I think I'm pretty — I could not, if I didn't have photographs, I don't think I could recall what they looked like. The only thing I remember is my mom's presence at certain times. I recall them vividly. And also, my dad in — one of the things that I vividly do remember 1s when he was taken away, and I think it was at night and some men came in uniform and they just took him away and, you know, we never saw him again after that, not to my recollection. Although, René, you've said you remember us visiting him in prison, but I don't remember. R: I don't know. I: No? R: We didn't see him then. I: I don't remember seeing him. R: I remember going to what I — assuming was some kind of — it was a huge building. To me, any building was — it was very powerful looking, as opposed to the other buildings and we would bring — my mother and I would bring, we — we would bring packages there. So, maybe. I: So maybe —but I don't...
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: Do you remember seeing soldiers in the street? Did you remember something that changed in Prague prior to your dad being taken? I: I don't think I remember anything changing, but I think there was a feeling. I remember having to wait, standing on lines. I don't know whether this is a later occurrence or from that time, but I just remember having to stand on lines. It could be, I don't know from where.
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q: For food? I: Maybe, maybe, I'm not — yes, maybe that's what it was.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: Do you remember any change? I know that you don't remember your mother in the visual sense, but do you remember a change in the household somehow after your father was taken or was it not that clear? I: I don't think it was that clear. I have a feeling my mom didn't say anything to us and I think that we probably felt our dad was going to come back. R: Yeah. I don't think there was any change. The time just melted.
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   Q: You were about what, four years old in here? I: Yes. R: Four.
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: So that's about 1941, maybe '42? R: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   Q: What is the next kinds of recollection that you have? Going to Theresienstadt? I: My next recollection 1s truthfully being on a train. R: Being there. I: No. I remember a train. R: You got an earlier —. I just remember being there. I: And it seemed like a normal train. It was a train ride and then we were someplace else and I guess that was Theresienstadt. R: I just remember being there. I don't remember getting there. Maybe I slept.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: And you lived with your mother? I: Yes, we were with our mom.
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   Q: What do you remember about Theresienstadt? School, food? Was your mother working? I: I really have very sketchy remembrances. I just — I remember cobblestone roads for some reason. And I remember archways — like tunnel like — I have no idea, it could be someplace else. I have this flashing thing of bodies in an open cart. R: I was just going to get to that. I remember carts being drawn through the streets. I knew they were bodies. I don't remember them being open, but I knew that they were — don't know how, but that seems to be in the picture very, very often. * Danuta Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945 (New York: H. Holt, 1990).
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Why not? I: We were scared. We knew that crying was not something you did. You didn't cry. R: I don't think we wanted to add anything to that noise there already. It was a long train ride. I: We had already learned the need to be silent to be quiet and well behaved. R: Probably.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   Q: Can I go back for just a minute? I: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Do you think you were afraid in Theresienstadt? Do you have any recollection of being afraid? R: For our personal safety? I: I don't think so, no. R: I mean, we saw these things going on and I think we just assumed that this is the way things are. I think our mother must have provided, I'm not just guessing, must have provided us with a real security type of blanket that we weren't, or it was our youth and we really didn't understand.
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   Q: On the train, how were the adults — well, was anybody relating to anybody else? Were some people talking or was there just a lot of noise people screaming? What other recollections do you have? Was your mother holding you? You holding onto your mother's leg? R: We were very close to her at all times. I think everybody was into their own — I don't remember people mixing or doing for one another.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Do you remember smells? R: Oh yeah. It was strong. I: It was terrible. R: Every kind of smell, excretion, either from the bottom or from throw up or — there was just no sanitation, nothing. Wherever you were, that's where it happened.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   Q: So you also urinated or moved your bowels there or do you have a recollection? R: I don't remember. I: I don't remember that. R: My mother must have taken care of that. She always had, right? I: I would imagine.
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: Do you remember arriving at this strange place that now has a name? R: Uh-hum, yeah. I: Yep.
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   Q: Describe it. R: It was night. I heard yelling "Raus,*" snowing a little bit too, I think. I: Yes. R: And it was refreshing at first, when they first opened the doors. I mean we had air for the first time, and it just hit you, it was good, but then the rest of it started happening. I: I remember just that we had to walk a little. I don't know if it was a long distance. It's hard to tell, but we walked and then I remember finding — we all, everybody off of that,
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: But the three of you were together? I: Yes. R: You say that with great certainty, so you remember? I mean, I think we were, too. I: Oh, yes I remember being together. R: I don't remember my mother. I'm trying so hard to do that. I: I remember being together and then at some point our mom even took us to the hospital to have a medical examination and this I remember because — sorry, René — you used to cry a lot. You didn't like doctors, and I was only worried that you were going to cry and something terrible was going to happen to you because I was a stoic. R: I cried? I: You didn't, not that time. But I remember that our mom took us. She was with us once.
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   Q: This was at some point? I: At some point.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: Do you remember being tattooed? R: Yes. I remember being tattooed. I remember the pain of the needle as they made the dots, and just surrounding it was this awful odor and I'm not sure what that odor was, but the tattooing comes together with an odor for me. So — but I don't remember anything else but just that needle.
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   Q: But your numbers are quite different, so you were not tattooed at the same time or you don't know? R: I don't know. I: I think we were. R: I mean, we now know that the numbers that were given to girls and to boys were different so we know this for a fact now. So, the numbers wouldn't be sequential, but I don't remember anybody else being tattooed except myself. I mean, I don't remember Irene being tattooed or my mother being tattooed. I: I don't have much of a recollection of the tattooing. R: You don't remember the tattooing? Such a sharp —. I: Yeah, but I don't know... R: We remember different things.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: And your hair, were you shaved? I: No. R: I don't think so. I: No, absolutely not. I had long hair at the end of the war.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   Q: Were you with other families? I: In the beginning, when we were with my mom, it seemed like there were grown ups and younger people and so I guess. I didn't really know. It seemed like a lot of different ages.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Was it possible that you were in the family camp, the Czech family camp? I: Very possible.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   Q: Do you remember food during this time when you were still with your mother? I: My only recollection of food is always the same. It's that black bread and something like potatoes or vegetable something, warm something. R: I don't have any recollection of food until later when I had to — when we were separated and I had to sift through garbage to get at potatoes. That seemed to have been my favorite thing. I would get a potato, make very thin slices and put it onto that stove. Most of the potatoes were
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Do you remember when you were separated? R: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   Q: Could you describe it? R: Well, to me it wasn't our separation to me, it was a feeling, it was a separation from my mother. She was, like, — she was taken away from us. I'm not sure what I heard or what I felt, but it was my mother and that was the only time that I felt that she was in real agony. It was a feeling, maybe a cry out or something, but I knew something was terribly, terribly wrong and that was the separation that I remember. I: I also remember it a little differently, but... R: Well, it's probably more accurate... I: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: I think we should stop. (Pause on tape)
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   Q: Since you were separated at this point, what I would like to do, is focus on each of your stories separately although, of course, you can talk or elaborate if someone forgets something. So, let's focus on you, Irene, and where you remember you were and what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Was anybody kind to you? I: I really, I can't remember. I felt no, it didn't seem to be — I always felt just outside somehow. I remember being a little jealous because it seemed like there was, there were two girls and it seemed like their mother — I don't know how they had a mother or somebody who would bring them things. R: Little girls? They were little girls? I: No, bigger than me, but they had somebody who brought them things, who was very close to them somehow and I remember, you know, kind of watching with great deal of envy.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   Q: Did you know you were twins? I: No, no, I don't think so. I knew I had a brother, but I had no idea of what twin even meant. In all of this, everything that happened, I always just thought this was what life was. I couldn't remember anything else anymore, and I used to think sometimes about our mother, fleetingly, like, “Well, maybe I'm never supposed to see her again — this is how things are.” And then just knowing that there was René over there. And then I remember one particular night that I was especially concerned about René, because there was like a big explosion, and there was a fire and it was all off to that side, to the right. I remember lying on my bunk bed and there
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Did you think about him a lot? I: In some way, I did. I kind of felt I had to stay in there because he was going to need me. That's pretty egotistical. Well...
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   Q: Do you remember other young girls in the same barrack? Were you with other people who also had these funny things happening to them, these horrible medical experiments? I: I thought I was the only one. In fact, it's interesting, when in 1985, when we first found out there were other twins who survived Auschwitz, I said to René, “I thought we were the only kids who survived, how could there be anybody else, what you do mean there are twins?” So, no, I had no idea that anybody else was having anything done to them.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Are there any other things you want to tell us about Auschwitz before the liberation? I: I remember once in the hospital there, I was there and something was going to happen. It seemed all the patients were being evacuated or cleared out or something and I remember somebody who worked in the hospital grabbed me and hid me behind her and just said, “be very quiet.” Of course I was. I mean, if I could have disappeared I would have, and that's all I know. I don't know who it was and I don't know what she might have saved me or not saved me from. And so that...
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   Q: Were you ever beaten? I: No, no, not that I — no.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Do you remember getting weaker and weaker? I: Yes, Ido. I remember getting weaker and weaker because towards the end just before liberation, I was on the ground and I could not even get up. And there were other people also on the ground to my recollection, and I didn't know if I was ever going to be able to get up off this floor. But I don't think I understood what “to be dead” meant even then, because I just didn't know what was going to be. I remember there were also, I remember sirens and bombings, noise, gun fire or maybe bombs. I'm not sure. Do you remember that at all? Sirens? R: Yes, I remember sirens and then the hum of the airplanes and they would always get everybody in and they would stand a soldier outside our barrack, one soldier outside the barrack. Don't know why.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   Q: Were you liberated in Auschwitz by the Russians? You may not have known that... I: Yes. I might not have known that that's what it was. I was literally picked up by a Polish lady who just took me to her home. I remember she carried me on her shoulders the whole way, because I couldn't, couldn't walk.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: You were eight? I: Yes. Going to be eight — R: You were, you were — your seventh year is December. You turned seven in December. I: Oh, I had just turned seven. R: You were just a little bit over seven. Same as me — that's how I remember. I: Good point.
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   Q: Rene, let's go to you and your months now in Auschwitz as you're alone. R: Well, I'm going to juxtaposition my things with hers. The long waits and roll calls, something that we mentioned before. The wires, yes, electric, every once in a while, somebody would go against those wires and then be still, but the wires to me were always near my barrack for some reason, were the backdrop of a hole, a long, deep ditch where I remember very often, very, very often they would just line up people and shoot them, because I remember as me and some other young youngsters, we went over to see what was happening to some of those people. I do remember one instance, where the person wasn't quite dead. He didn't stop moving. I do remember him having a big bump on his head and the people, there some of the people, actually
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: There were older men in your barrack? R: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   Q: Were there older women in your barrack, too? I: Yes. R: And I was very close to the crematoria, because there was a constant flow of people going into this and nobody every coming out. I was very close to that road. I was, like, very close to the barracks. I always had a view of that.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Could you smell? R: Yes. The odor was just bad. It was just bad. Everything there was bad. Foul, all the odors were foul except for that wood. * x-ray (German)
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   Q: Did you have showers with some regularity? I: Yes. R: I don't remember any showers at all, but that doesn't mean.... I do remember though, I did see Irene once. I saw her once across — a wire fence. I don't know whether I was walking to the hospital myself, but I saw her somewhere in the middle and I recognized her. Nothing was said and I just looked at her and I knew she was there. I don't know if she remembers the moment, but I always, from that point on, and I think maybe even before, I knew that she was alive. It was the inspiration, it was the motivation to keep me going. I knew I had to stay, stick around and do until I met her for her sake, or for whatever sake, but I knew that you were there somewhere there and in a certain direction. I: I don't really recall the moment, though I'm really trying hard to see if I can, but I do, I must in some ways recall it on a different level, because I knew that you were alive, so I must have known because then later on, after liberation, I knew that you were alive, so perhaps I did see you and I just don't recall it. End of Tape 1
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Rene, you were describing — not individual people, but, in some way, the relationships there. Did you feel less alone than, than Irene described herself? Or did you feel... R: I would have to think that I wasn't alone. I was with other people. I did not, however, think of Irene or my mother. I just accepted what was there and went with it.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   Q: Did you ever cry? R: I don't remember. I'm sure I did, but I don't remember crying, no. Just to catch up to Irene's liberation, I was also liberated pretty much at the same time, but under totally different circumstances. I remember before the end came, the end of Auschwitz, the liberation, there was an increased amount of noise, which I now know was gun fire around, and less of a German presence. We were marched somewhere from some point to somewhere and whoever couldn't do this marching, if they stepped out of line or fell down, they were just eliminated, so I knew I had to keep marching. Again, there was increased gun fire at this point, I'd have to say it was, and then all of a sudden the Germans were gone. They were just gone, and we were surrounded by these white uniformed — which I know were Russians now. That's how my liberation — I do have to insert, that I do remember one Russian solider, officer on a horse, which to me looked pink. It looked like a pink horse to me, but that's one of the memories, and the white uniforms. Definitely white uniforms.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Was it night or day? R: Night.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   Q: What languages were you speaking in Auschwitz? R: That's a good question, because I just thought of it myself and I don't really remember whether it was or what it was. I: Actually, we spoke German and Czech, because I did understand what — I understood what was going on around me. R: Well, I understood too, but I never put it together. If Germans were talking, I understood, I guess I did... I: That makes sense because our parents came from Germany, so we probably grew up speaking German and Czech.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: In the barrack, do you remember what the inmates were talking? Do you remember not understanding a lot of people?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   Q: Did you also get black bread? R: I don't remember black bread at all.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: So, what you remember 1s stealing potatoes? R: Potatoes.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   Q: You don't remember being fed? R: No.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Do you remember drinking anything? R: No.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   Q: Irene, do you? I: Yes, something brown, but I don't know what it was. R: There was a liquid. There was a liquid served. I don't ever remember ever partaking of it, but there was a pot, yes. There was a pot and people would sort of line of for this thing. I don't remember ever having any.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Do you remember the latrines? R: No.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   Q: You have no recollection of where you went to the bathroom? R: None, absolutely none. I: Now I do remember, I thought at one time that I actually saw like bones in the latrine. I don't know. R: That's strange. It's really strange that I can't, I don't remember.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Do you ever remember washing your hands?
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   Q: Do you remember what you were wearing? R: It didn't fit, whatever it was, and it was all over me. It was on my head, it was all over, but I don't remember what it was.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: What happened to you when you were liberated, when the Russian on the pink horse came? R: Well, I remember being marched a little further with a throng of people into a warehouse of food, and I remember getting hold of a golden looking can and rolling it. I remember that was my, that was my prize. And when they finally opened it, it turned out to be sauerkraut. That's what I remember about it.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   Q: Did you eat it? R: Yeah, tasted it.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Did you get sick? R: No, I don't remember getting sick. I understand that a lot of people did get very, very sick from eating.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   Q: Do, do you remember where they took you? Did they take you back to Auschwitz? R: I don't remember.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: And then what happened? I mean, were you there for a very long time or did someone — ? R: Time is just totally meaningless at this point. My very next real memories — I know that I went to, to a hospital somewhere, but my next memories are in an orphanage in KosSice, Czechoslovakia.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   Q: What happened there? R: This was obviously after the war. It was a Catholic orphanage or hospital, because I remember being embraced by these nuns. In fact, I remember once being embraced by a very large nun to the point where I lost one of my teeth, which had to be loose, because it was obviously an embrace of love, not a hurting kind of thing. But those are just little things. And I was with a lot of children, but there was an administrator in this hospital who took me into his
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Did you know you were Jewish? R: I had the feeling. I had the feeling, which really came just out a little bit later when this Doctor Kalina had to leave his home, leave the country. Because somewhere — he had to leave, and I think it had to do with Communist takeover at that time in Czechoslovakia and I started to go to school in KoSice, and he left me with his sister, Edith Mann, and her husband, Joseph Mann. They had a boy, Otto, and a girl, Bibi (ph), Bibi, we lived very close to the school, and I knew I was Jewish then because, first of all, they were Jewish and I was called a Jew in the school. Everyday when I, when school got out — there was one other Jew in the entire school. His name was Sobol (ph). I'll never forget the name, Sobol. I don't know his first name, but the boys are waiting for us to beat us and stone us every single day. It was a hassle to get out of school.

   Q: Did the family know this? Did you tell them? R: I think they knew it, but maybe they — I don't think anything was done. The school administration, now that I'm thinking about it, probably didn't do anything either, because I do remember being exposed to Catholic teachings 1n the classroom and we did go to church together for whatever. I remember always trying to be at the back, so I wouldn't maybe not get in, not enough room for me to get in or something or to sneak away, but I knew I was Jewish, definitely from that. They reminded me that I was and I'm sure the number on my arm was some kind of a signal. Though I know that not only Jews got numbers, but I think most Jews had that number. I think it was an identifier and the number was there. And I was, I also knew that I was Jewish, because the Mann family did observe certain holidays. I do remember going to synagogue in KoSice. I don't remember ever praying, but I do remember having fights with boys — we'd sort of like divide the synagogue yard into two areas and chestnuts would fall and we'd throw these

   Q: Of course, you remembered Irene, because...? Did you tell people you had a sister? [Irene shakes his head] Why? R: I think I did tell them, after first contact was made, but it came from America. I think it came from Irene's side. She's the one who somehow — well, she'll tell you how she let the people know she that had a brother, but no I wasn't making it a —.

   Q: But you don't know why? R: No, no, I knew. I mean, it kept me going, it kept me going. And I have to say that this Mann family, they took me in and they treated me just like one of their children. Very understanding woman, this Edith Mann was. She knew what a boy, a young boy was all about, and she let me do things that all boys, I think, should be doing at that point in life. They bought me — in Czechoslovak, it's kolobezka’*, it's a scooter with just two wheels and a platform and a thing. It was one of the fanciest ones, and I loved that. I: It's funny. You just reminded — we had those when we were little. R: Really? I: We had them. R: Maybe that's how I learned how to ride them, because I was an expert. I: We had them, I remember. You push off with one foot and you hold on. We had them, we had them. R: Yes, that was one of them. They were a wonderful family but that was life in KoSice. Oh, they let me do something else. She let me buy two Angora rabbits. I had two Angora, they're white rabbits with red eyes, and they were babies. So they were very cute, when they were little, but then after a while they got to be big and we had to get rid of them. So I'll never forget every weekend or every two weeks there was a market, a farmer's market would open up. All the farmers would come into a big square in the town and they would sell their product, produce, whatever. I was at one of those stands trying to sell — I don't know if I was trying to sell my two rabbits. I don't even remember if I ever sold them, but they disappeared. “ scooter (Czech)

   Q: This is the third animal that you've mentioned. You mentioned a goat, and the two rabbits. Is this something special? R: I don't think so, because I'm not particularly crazy about animals, certainly not to live with them, which is apparently what was going on. There was a dog also in Kalina's. Somehow I remember a dog, also a puppy, didn't last very long.

   Q: Yeah. R: No, I don't think so. I do remember doing all the normal things, you know, looking for treats and I ate everything, kosher or unkosher, which obviously, I had no idea about. In fact, I do remember now eating the unkosher things, like, whatever it is, it's called slanina&gt;. I think it's fat, I think it's just lard or.... Shepherds used to eat this. I remember going into the fields and shepherds would have this shepherd's bag and they would pull out this big hunk loaf of bread and then unwrap this smaller meaty white looking white, mostly white and take a knife and cut. It looked so great and delicious that I had to partake.

   Q: Irene, let's go back to you and take you up to the point — this point. So, this woman takes you on her back, she carries... I: She carries me piggy back kind of fashion, and I'm holding on to her, and I don't have a clue to where we're going, but it didn't take too long. And I find myself in this apartment and it's facing a square, and diagonally across to the right is where the Russian soldiers are housed in some big huge building. It was like a square, there were, and her name was Mrs. Mucha. R: Yes, Mucha? I: Means fly in Polish, and I remember now always being embarrassed to say the name because I knew what it meant and — you know it's like... R: I've never heard this. I: I — when I first got there, I must have been pretty sick. And I remember that she had me in bed and she called, I guess, what was a doctor, and I remember having hot — this is going to — hot glasses — that were heated glasses that were like put on the body at different parts. Do you know what I'm talking about even?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   Q: No. I: It's very, very weird. I don't know what it was for, but I guess I eventually got better, because I did finally get out of bed, and I got enrolled in Catholic school and actually I think I knew, because you asked René about being Jewish, but I think I didn't want to be Jewish and I thought this was neat. It was pretty — the only thing is Mrs. Mucha was very, very, very strict, so that if I came home two minutes later than she thought it should have taken me to walk home from school, we got punished.

   Q: Did he harm you? \I: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Sexually? I: I don't want to talk about that. I remember going to school and going to church and I remember, that I — when the priest called — there was a time when you could go down and they put something in your mouth, you know those white thin, looked so great, and I wanted to know if I was ever going to get a chance, but no such luck. But, I do remember having rosary beads and I became very devout, very devout. You know, I really didn't want to be Jewish. I mean, I was glad, “this is great.” But I also — maybe it wasn't totally great. In the summertime, she would take me to visit. She had family in the countryside and it would be a long, hugely long walk. It seemed like hours we'd walk with this wheelbarrow or something, because then we'd bring home produce from the farm. Now, on the farm, there were some other children, but I was really devastated by them, because they made fun of my number. And I didn't know how to stand up for myself. I was very quiet and very shy and I was very obedient. I was a scared bunny. I was scared all the time. I remember one particular evening or day, I kind of got lost on the farm. I don't know, it was getting dark and I didn't really know how to find my way back, and I guess I, they eventually found me, but I remember being pretty scared. I also, interesting enough, was put in charge of bunnies, of rabbits, I had to clean. She had rabbits. Not one, not two, rabbits, lots of rabbits, hutches, you know. I had to clean the rabbit cages, but I got very attached to the rabbits, but, you see, she used them for food, like on Sundays we would have rabbit. I couldn't eat. She got very mad at me and I got punished for that too, but I just couldn't eat the rabbits. I couldn't. We had a, we didn't have a bathroom in the apartment. There was an outhouse. I remember on Christmas, she told me that if I was a very good child and if I watched the sky, I would see Santa Claus come down in his coach and I would get a present, if I was very good. I remember I fell for this, and I believed her and I stayed up the entire night looking at the sky, and I never saw. I thought I was good, but I guess I figured I wasn't good enough and I never saw him. And I didn't even get a present. Well, I guess I got a present, 1t was a cookie made in the shape of what do they call them like gingerbread — R: A gingerbread house? I: No, like a person, like a little girl or something.

   Q: Was she ever affectionate with you? I: No. R: It sounds pretty rough to me. I haven't really digested all of this ever. I: Well, you're saying it sounds pretty rough, but it was better than Auschwitz. R: Well, I'm comparing it to what I went through.

   Q: What do you mean it was dirty? What was it about that you can remember’? I: They weren't dressed nicely, they were schlumpy and things were left on the table. It was just messy, I guess, maybe not dirty, but just messy, and it bothered us. We were neatniks in those days. You should see my house now.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: But you didn't escape? I: No, no we didn't. I got shipped to France and finally wound up in an orphanage in Fublaines, which is on the outskirts of Paris. I was one of the youngest children there, and I didn't speak to anybody, except Miriam, who was, I guess, about seven years older. She seemed like almost a mother figure in a sense to me, because I had these long curls and she would fuss with them and she just was very compassionate, and I, the other children — I was the only child there with a number, so I also felt that there was something wrong with me. I felt that I had done something horrible that I had gotten the number and nobody else did. Most of these children had escaped somehow by hiding, or their parents had temporarily given them over and some were subsequently reunited with parents and some just had family members and they were just waiting to be shipped to, and things like that. Even when I was in Fublaines, I tried extra hard to be good. I was “Miss Goody Two Shoes.” I would help. Anybody needed help, I was there. And I also was a stoic. There was time when we were getting some kind of — I really should go back and say I had all these horrible boils on my body at one point when I got to Fublaines. I don't know if it was an infestation of lice, but all these huge scars on my legs. A lot of us had it, and I remember, we had to go — the couple that ran this home, the father was, I think, a doctor and we had to go to him every day and he'd put this cream or something on it, and I remember always trying to, like, be very brave and, you know, show that it didn't hurt because I thought then they'd like me a little better than all the other children. ° Branch of the international religious Zionist organization, Agudath Israel.

   Q: At that point did you decided you wanted to be Jewish? I: Well, it seemed like Miriam was, so it was okay, you know. We were going to be together so it didn't matter anymore what, yeah, we did — and I liked it, because we did have Shabbats and I know we always got a special dress for Shabbat, which we then had to turn quickly in, because then we got whatever we wore for the whole week. I remember vanity gets in my way too, because we would get shipments of clothing items from the States or wherever and there was these red shoes. I had to have the red shoes. I remembered sandals. I remember these were with little holes in them, like a shoe sandal. I had to have them. So, when the children tried on the shoes I said, “I want those shoes.” They were too small for me but I said, “They fit great. I like them, I love them, they're my shoes.” And because of this, very shortly after that, we took a long walk into Paris, or went for a really long walk, and of course, you can imagine what happened to my feet. I had blisters. My feet were bleeding. I was in so much pain that the head mistress had to actually take me in Paris to buy me a pair of bigger shoes. I got white. I got white. They weren't red, but okay, but they weren't brown. I hated brown, and that's all that I had had before. My story with the shoes.

   Q: When you were in Poland with this woman, Mrs. Mucha, you decided you didn't want to be Jewish, what was going through your mind? I: What was going through my mind is that I felt to be Jewish was not a good thing. People didn't like Jews and it was just much better to be Catholic because that was just what everybody was. I wanted to be part of what everybody was — and gee — it was pretty. R: I never knew that there was an option even for this. I sort of was always reminded that I was Jewish and I accepted that. And I knew I wasn't liked, but I accepted it. I did have though one in the very early stages when I first started to go to school and they had these Catholic priests teach us the religion. It seemed so very, so very pretty, the statues and the rays going to the heads it seemed very nice and clean, and the Christmas also seemed very — but somehow I couldn't put it together with what these people were really doing.

Anyway, a young woman who accompanied us and, we came — that's how we came to New York. The plane ride was horrific. I remember getting sick. I remember throwing up.

We were on TV, early TV We were on the radio, and Life magazine did a full spread and a cover story and yes, they did raise thousands of dollars. In the meantime, I was staying at Mr. Tenzer's home. And well — no, at the beginning we stayed at a posh hotel. Wait a minute, we stayed at a hotel in New York City, and I remember getting served white bread for the first time and corn flake cereal, which I detest to this day, because — what is this? White bread, I didn’t — and the photographers were taking pictures, so they wanted us to look all excited about this, so I looked excited — but I said “I'm not eating this.” So, and we went shopping in this big department store.

   Q: Irene, if we can just go back for a moment, when you were with Mrs. Mucha, she did something very bizarre with you. Can you describe it? I: Yes. Every once in a while she would take me, I didn’t really realize where at the time, but we would sift through ashes looking for gold teeth, and I realized that the surroundings were kind of familiar when I got there. I guess she was taking me back to Auschwitz-Birkenau and we were looking for gold teeth. And by this time, I understood that a lot of people had died here and had been set ablaze here. And it was a very difficult thing for me to do but — and I had — she insisted that I do this. I had to come up with some gold teeth.

   Q: You were talking, René, about being in the National Guard? R: Yeah. I joined the National Guard in the early 60s, maybe even '59 it was. I don't remember exactly. I was an observant Jew and I saw nothing wrong with it. I saw nothing wrong with having my arm bared, which was many times. There I remember the showers very clearly. The army showers. I had my head shaved, it was really funny, now that I think about it. I was surprised that it was only like a decade or so after the war, the World War II and the ignorance of the people when they saw my arm. They were like, “It's your phone number, it's your social security number? Is it your...” they really had no idea. And then, coupled with my wearing a hat or a yarmulke in the mess hall, and usually carrying my own food in or asking for certain food to be prepared. I was surprised at the negative feelings that I got. Well, maybe it's the wrong word, surprised. That's the way it's been all my life all over, but I thought, “In the army — the American Army, we're sharing something.” I was such a good soldier. A marksman, my company commander was very proud of me. I was his only Jew, but I was the best, so, but it was surprising, that so shortly after the war, there was still ignorance and these negative feelings about Jews.

   Q: When they asked you, “Is this your telephone number?” I mean, clearly you said “no,” but did you say —? R: I told them what it was. I said — I explored it with them — “You really don't know what this is?” and they didn't. Then, I told them, and they still weren't quite sure what to make of that. “Was it a Jewish symbol? Did it make you a Jew?” I said, “No, this is man's symbol of inhumanity to another man. Tattooing instead of giving me a name, giving me a number.” You know, I tried to explain it. Some got it, some didn't.

   Q: Tell me something. At this point, in the 60s, what did you know about where you were at that time in the 40s? Did you know it was Auschwitz?

   Q: You studied biochemistry, you said? I: Right, right. Iam a biochemist. I never spoke about the Holocaust, because I — as I said — | had this feeling that nobody ever really wanted to hear about it. Also, our parents kind of told us, you know, “it’s best,” and what was everybody’s feeling, “You were young, forget about it. You've got a new life, and just, you know, put the past out of your minds.” In a way, I did that. I listened. I said, “Okay, great. I'm American. I'll put 1t out of my mind.” But, in a way, I was suffering twice. I had already suffered, and now I was suffering, because I couldn't even talk about it. It made me feel like maybe there was something to really be ashamed about, because nobody wanted to know about it. And as I went through high school, I remember the Holocaust was not even mentioned. We learned the world history. We learned about World War II, but — and this was a yeshiva! So, it was pretty frightening to me, I — and then when I got to college, it was pretty much the same thing. I found that my friends knew very little about the Holocaust. Nobody spoke about it. There weren't any programs yet, and I really — it just reconfirmed for me that it was something that I need to be ashamed of and I don't want anybody to know that I am a survivor.

She said, “You don't have to tell her these things.” R: The Slotkins, in all their good qualities and beautiful intentions, they slipped up over here a little bit. They were a little over protective, I think. They really tried to hide the truth, in a way of protecting us, really. I don't think they had anything else in mind. I: But it backfired, because the more they said don't talk about it, the more it was still always there, because it's always with me and not being able to express it or tell or share any of it was really hard.

I: For me, I had some of the remembrances we spoke about when we were children. And so, when I saw him, “Now I have finally have somebody I can check some of this stuff out with.” I think we did check some of that pre stuff out that we never spoke about after Theresienstadt. It was only what happened before. That's how we spoke about the doll and about the bee sting and a couple of things like that. So, that was nice to confirm.

   Q: So what happens in the 80s? I: Well, in 1985, it was probably in December we got a call from Eva Kor!” who was the founder and remains the president of an organization called CANDLES, which stands for Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiment Survivors, it's a mouthful, God! CANDLES. And she told us that they're going to have a reunion, a first time reunion of all surviving twins in Israel, and that we were going to bring Joseph Mengele in absentia to a tribunal and Gideon Hausner!? was going to chair it and are you going to come? We were just —as I said before, I said, “You mean we're not the only children to survive Auschwitz?” But it was a drawing card, I think, for René and myself. For me, I had a tremendous need to find somebody who knew me. I wanted to be affirmed in some way. “Oh please, let me — somebody knows me, so they can tell me what exactly happened. And are my memories, they're so bizarre, can they be real?” And so, we decided we'd do it. And, you know, it's in retrospect now, because we did that and we started talking to each other and heard some of the other twins and some of their testimonies and it was like, “Ah-ha, that's what happened to me!” You know, we realized that our memories were true, as bizarre as they might be, they really happened, and subsequently, we were able to research out a lot of our past, because we started looking into history books and original documentation from Auschwitz and Givat Chaim" in Israel, we started piecing together dates and occurrences. We were also very fortunate to have a lot of photographs that were saved by our aunt for us and letters and documentations, birth certificates and such. So, it's wonderful. R: It's like finding roots. Roots is very important in American history.

   Q: What did that do? I mean, it's clear what it did for you probably together and for yourself, but when you came back to the United States in terms of your friends, in terms of your parents? I: Well, our dad was already dead, and my mom, we started — I started giving talks on Yom Ha-Shoah!&gt;. It's one of the things I still do. And we were in the news media a lot at that time, and I think my mom was kind of proud, but she didn't want to hear it. She's never come to hear me talk. She never came. She's dead now, but she never came, and she never wanted to hear about it. I could not talk to her about it at all, absolutely not.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Did that hurt you? I: It's hard, yes. R: Yeah, it's hard, because here is somebody who certainly loves you and wants to do absolutely the best, and yet somehow doesn't have enough strength or wisdom to be sensitive to understand that this other person has to express or wants to — I mean, we really didn't want to go and spill our guts out, just a little bit. I think maybe part of it was that she really wanted to play the mother role. She was the only mother. She was afraid of maybe losing that. I'm just talking now. We don't know, we really don't know. But her motivation was pure, I know that, absolutely pure.

   Q: Did it shock your friends? I: I had some friends who were totally taken aback, they said, “But you're so American. You don't talk like a European. You don't look like, you know.” And — but the truth of it is, that even though I'm so "American," because I knew how to fit in, the truth is that everything I did and everything I excelled at, whether it was in school or being, I mean, I made my parents — right, I was the salutatorian of the class, the editor of the newspaper, the yearbook, the — you name it, I did it — but always there was that feeling like I was apart. I never — never felt a part of anything. There was always a wall someplace. I said, “You guys don't know what I know.” And I remember when I first even started school here. I remember the kids would talk out of turn in class or they didn't bring in the homework and I said, “My God, how can you do that?” I said, “How can you do that?”
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: You were a good girl? R: Just generally, I think the European school system is so different. I remember, I used to, other than the unpleasant things, I used to have to bring my own stick to school, in case I misbehaved and get hit on my hands. So, there was this big theory to get a very thin stick, then it will really sting, or get a fat stick, and it will really hurt. This was a big problem.

   Q: Were you in classes together through high school? R: Yes, through high school. I: In our English classes we were together, but in Hebrew we were separated.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: Was that fun to be in school together? I: No. R: No. I: No, it wasn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   Q: Why? R: The class was really too small. I think there were only 11 of us, because this was the beginning of a school there, we were always the eldest — we were senior class in yeshiva, right. Even if we were juniors or sophomores or freshmen, we were always the oldest. There were — nobody older than us, so it was too close. I: It was too close. We weren't the same kind of student. R: She was a student, I was a playboy.

   Q: What did you end up doing — since we know what Irene ended up doing? R: I ended up getting married early and out of the house, making a mistake doing that, I think, but as God's ways are so strange, everything I've done in my life has led up to what we're on now. And I can see the whole picture now and it's not so bad. I paid my dues, but I have the most wonderful wife in the world, the wonderful wife, the best, and I have the best kids and the best grandchildren, so I'm happy.

   Q: What did you do for a living? I: I worked in the packaging field all my life. Packaging.

  <p id="136">
   Q: Do the two of you live near each other? I: Relatively, I live on Long Island, he lives in Manhattan. And I also have the best family, René. So, you know, I have the best kids too. I don't have any grandkids yet, but I definitely have the best great-grand whatever they are to me.

   Q: Right, René was just made a grandfather twice? R: Last week, right. I: I also do calligraphy and write poetry. R: She's very talented. I: I don't know if I'm talented, but... R: What this '85 thing also did for us, 1t made the two of us talk. Not during any session at home, we would not talk about it. Like in between sessions in the hotel room, we would talk about it, and that's the only time we talk about it. We'll go home now and we're not going to talk about this, but we talked about it a little bit this morning or last night on the way to the airport, and that's it. It's just something that is not really, I guess — it's not pleasant. It's unnerving. It takes a lot out of, out of you, but we've done it now since '85. We've talked because we feel it's really necessary, and the further we go away from it, the more necessary, I think, it becomes because we see a lot of funny things going on out there, in terms of did it really happen? Did it
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say? I: I'm going to say that this has been painful for me to do, even though René says we've been doing it now since '85. I, I'm always disturbed for days on end after I've done it, but I agree with René that it's something that we need to do for our children, so that they can pass on the story, because it must never be forgotten, and I guess that's why I do it. R: I have to say again that what's happening today, we are meeting up with people that are using the story for their own purpose and, obviously, if they're using a story that's not true, they're changing it. That is we can't stand by, as hurtful as it is to question a survivor, because I know when somebody asks me a question, it's got to be done. It's got to be done to pollute the history of something like this, it’Il lose any potential for learning something from it. I: Well, the historical integrity of the Holocaust must really be upheld and it's got to be done with the truth. R: And I think more people when they put somebody in the front or recognize by whatever slight means, survivor, I think at this point have to question and document that person.

   Q: Yours is 169061. I: We've been trying to find out what my mom's number might have been. We didn't find out yet. R: We suspect it was probably close to that number, but we don't know.
