  <p id="215">
   A: No, military truck, they got benches on both sides and [indecipherable] out the -- make the [indecipherable] of it, and they -- they took us to that place, Lienzingen.
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: And please describe Lienzingen to me.
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Lienzingen was the first camp, and we worked, they took us several kil-kilomers, we had to walk to a place, a zoological garden. There was no animals, we were the animals actually, and we dug ditches. They measured up so many -- so many feet th- the lengths, so many feet the widths, and so many feet the depth. And you have to do it through -- through the day. Day in and day out, the same thing, may -- we dug those di-ditches. And it was terrible, very, very bad. And they told us, this is the last week, and we going to go to another place, going to be much nicer, the food will be better, everything will be better, and the -- we’re going to go -- they’re going to ship us to Germany. And I didn’t like it, to go Germany, I didn’t like it at all. So I didn’t tell anybody in the camp, my friends, that I made up my mind I’m not going to go, I going to escape. Well, I mean -- and so --
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Um, before we get to that, let’s talk a little bit more about the conditions in -- in Lienzingen. Did you sleep in a barracks?
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Yeah, there was -- there wasn’t a barracks yet, and it was like a -- like a -- like herrings, one on top, next to each other, th-the bunks, like, you know? And the -- and I mean, it was -- was very bad. And that’s frightened, more than anything else, to go to Germany. | figure, well I was born in Poland, I might as well die there, I don’t want March 6, 2007 to go to Germany. And th-they told us, this is the last week, and we’re going to go away to Germany. I did make up my mind, I’m not going to go. And I did escape from the -- from the place I was working, and they knew right away that I escape, because you have to line up for a roll call, and they were looking for me, I no -- I knew that. And I took a chance, a big chance. I think my mind didn't work right, if anybody with -- with the right mind, will not do what I did to escape. And the reason for that 1s, some of them did escape, but they caught them in no time. And th -- when they caught them in a Mo-Monday or Tuesday, or a Thursday, or whatever day was, they put them- th-they brought them back to their camp to wh-where he escaped, and Sunday they brought them out on roll call, everybody was there lined up. They brought them up, they brought a portable gallow, and he was hanged. So I knew what’s going to happen when -- when they catch me. But I made up my mind, I -- I blanked out, you know, I didn’t think about that, and I was lucky, very extremely lucky they didn’t catch me. So I went from pillar to post, like the saying goes, knock on the door, beg for a piece of bread. Some -- some women, some people offered to give me a piece of bread, others slammed the door in my face. Get -- get the hell out of here, dirty Jew. They knew right -- right away I was Jewish. So after awhile, if I had somebody with me, I would probably wind out in the -- in the forest, but by myself didn’t know where to go, how to go. So, I was -- and I knew at the college, there was -- there were Jews there, and there was a ghetto there, I knew that. So took me days, weeks, maybe several months, March 6, 2007 little by little I got into the city, to college, and little kids were playing [indecipherable] ball there, and I went and talked to them, and I said, I understand the Jews live here, they call it the ghetto or something, can you show me where it is? So one boy is pulling on the other, don’t talk to him, th-the -- it’s prohibit and you can’t go there. You cannot go there, and the only -- the one of them said come, Ill show you. He went with me and from a distance I saw already th-th-the fence, you know. And -- and I went there, and -- and I was walking close by. And there was a gate there, the gate was open, the chain was hanging down, and the Germans, the Nazis were going back and forth. One was going this way, the other one was going this way, and they meet. And the -- and the gate was open [indecipherable] down, when there’s s -- when they start talking, I crossed over and I smuggle myself in. They luckily didn’t notice me. But who noticed me? The Jewish police. Wh-What th -- they have a black uniform with the nightstick, and armband, dai politsi, police, and that’s all they had. So they grabbed me, and they start talking in Polish to me, what right do you have to -- to smuggle yourself into the ghetto, in Polish. I says -- and I talk back in Yiddish. And they couldn’t believe, because oh, the kid was born probably amongst the Jews there, th-the -- ye -- you know, with Jew -- where a lot of Jewish live, and he picked up some Jewish, he is not Jewish. And I tried to talk to him, I’m Jewish, I’m Jewish, no, no. They took me 1n a room there and I said, I can tell you I’m Jewish because there come a transport from Kalish and there were some -- a couple of doctors there. Dr. Cohen March 6, 2007 was one of them. Then another one, but I couldn’t -- I couldn’t remember the other one, and they said to me [indecipherable] saying the other, well the kid is talking sense because they shipped out some people with the Dr. Cohen, somebody else, anyway. So they said, okay, what is your name? They wrote down the letters Fievish Nicinski and then they wrote in big letters too, your name is Bahardian Elias, born [indecipherable]. And I was the age -- they make the age like 27 years old. So -- so we g -- we going to check with you. We not tell you when, tomorrow, next day, whatever it is. You’re not going to take out a piece of paper, you have to memorize the name in where was you -- where was you born. So I recognized that [indecipherable] that I had tried to memorize all this, and they took me in next day, what is your name? So I have to tell them Bahardian [indecipherable] this and that. And then I learned from the others, that the guy like this escaped. They didn’t notify the -- the German authority, so they got a special ration of whatever the -- you know, bread and milk, whatever it was. They didn’t -- they didn’t tell the German that he escaped. So I took his name. And so from there, one fine night they circled the ghetto, raus, raus, raus, out, out, out. And they took us to another ghetto, Lodz. Lithmanstadt. They call it Lodz, Lodz ghetto. There I was, and I worked there, I worked there hard. There was a- a press, I was ironing, ironing uniforms, SS, Gestapo uniforms. And they told me, you have to be extremely, extremely careful. Don’t let any spot come out and make holes in it, because that’s very dangerous. You -- you pay a big penalty for that. The March 6, 2007 irons weren’t like it is here, electric. They were born -- burn -- burn wood, like, used to be, you know? And heated up the irons. And that’s how it was. And from there they took me to a camp near Skarzysko-Kamienna. That was the biggest Polish ammunition factory. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

They point out, if you look away, you’ll be next. If you look one way or the other way, left or right. You had to look straight ahead, and they have a speech there. This is -- this is the -- th-the verdict for -- for e-escaping. That’s how far you can go. This is it. You try to escape and that’s what -- that what’s going to happen to you. Then they put the fear o-over you, you know. But I did it, I -- I don’t know, it - it was difficult, but I da -- I didn’t know what to do. Once I did I regret anyway because -- because I -- I -- I was talking to myself I shou -- maybe I should go back.

  </p>
  <p id="554">
   A: I didn’t know. One fine day they said we going, and we going. They didn’t tell us where, and that’s where I wind up. We went from -- from Wartawerk, went to Germany.

  </p>
  <p id="561">
   Q: Right. And that’s why you escaped. So what were your thoughts now here, that you were going to Germany?
  </p>
  <p id="562">
   A: Oh, I had no choice. I had a taste of it, how miserable I was. I couldn’t find anyone walking by myself for weeks and several months. And at least we’re going together with -- with other Jewish boys, I figure well, whatever would happen to them, it’ll happen to me.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   Q: So you then arrive in -- in Dora.
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   Q: And -- and what will you do, what were you working at there?
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   A: In Dora it was -- that was the forest -- the forest camp already. And that was -- happened to be the worst one of all, so far. I was working outside, loading the ready material what came out from the bunker, and also unloading the raw material what came in. And the sirens start blowing the [indecipherable] the siren, and they said no matter what you’re doing, drop everything, and if you hear that, run into the bunker as fast as you possibly can. So it happen, you know, we hear the siren blowing, and we run into 1 -- into the bunker and in groups, the Polish groups here, Hungarian groups a March 6, 2007 different place, Romanian, Czechs and so on. And we talk quiet in the Polish so wouldn’t understand. And we could hear a little bit that they bomb above us. And was all over, raus, raus, out, out, out, went out, and we were disappointed. Were so disappointed maybe next time God will help, it’Il penetrate and -- and we’ll all get killed, because it was miserable, we couldn’t take it no more. Well, another time came and was the same thing, and we were disappointed. And finally they say, well, this is the last week you’re going to work here, they’re going to go to another place, it’s going to be much better. So we say, well, you see, he said [indecipherable] he said there’s no God, oh there’s God, oh glory halleluiah, there’s a God after all, we hug each other. The name didn’t mean anything, really. So from Dora, we went to a place named Buchenwald.
  </p>
  <p id="567">
   Q: Before -- yeah, w-we’ll talk about Buchen-Buchenwald in a minute. Yo- You were willing to get killed in Dora in the bombing raid?
  </p>
  <p id="568">
   A: Yeah, we were hoping that that -- that will happen.
  </p>
  <p id="569">
   Q: Why’?

  <p id="570">
   A: Because get out the misery, you know, it was terrible.
  </p>
  <p id="571">
   Q: W-Was this -- were they starting to make the V2 bombers at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="572">
   A: Well, they produce the V2 rockets, which they sent to England, they bombed England, London, that was the V2 rockets. March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="573">
   Q: Now, when you said you were into the bunkers, was that the tunnels that they had at Dora?
  </p>
  <p id="574">
   A: It’s exactly the tunnel, where the machinery were and they were all working there inside. That was in the tunnel. We have to go in there when they ha -- when we heard the siren blowing, you know, we have to go in there. That’s where we went.
  </p>
  <p id="575">
   Q: But your work was always outside?
  </p>
  <p id="576">
   A: Mine was always outside, happened to be, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   Q: Because I understand that the people who worked inside couldn’t get outside.
  </p>
  <p id="578">
   A: No, no, they have to be inside, no.
  </p>
  <p id="579">
   Q: And did they give you enough food?
  </p>
  <p id="580">
   A: No, very little food. Food wasn’t very much at all. Lot of people think because it was a labor camp they gave you more. If they did, I didn’t noticed it.
  </p>
  <p id="581">
   Q: And again, was it just coffee and soup and bread?
  </p>
  <p id="582">
   A: Yeah, the same thing, yeah. Didn’t change much from one camp to the other.
  </p>
  <p id="583">
   Q: Ho -- were you very, very thin by that point?
  </p>
  <p id="584">
   A: Yes, I lost weight continuously, all the time, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="585">
   Q: [indecipherable] your health at that point?
  </p>
  <p id="586">
   A: The health wasn’t too bad, just weak, hungry all the time, dirty.
  </p>
  <p id="587">
   Q: S-So, when you were in Dora, did you have any hope left? March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="588">
   A: Very little, we were disappointed. We were disappointed that, you know, they don’t do anything -- a better job than that, than -- they have a heavier bomb, a better bomb to penetrate. They didn’t have it at that time. We were disappointed.
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   Q: Did you know where the V2 rockets were going to be sent?
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   A: No, no idea.
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   Q: Mm-hm. So you -- you stayed in d -- in Dora for how long?
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   A: Oh, quite a few months, I don’t know exactly how long, but quite a few months. Then we went to, of course, the Buchenwald.
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   Q: Did you know what Buchenwald was before you went?
  </p>
  <p id="594">
   A: No, just the name. The same like Auschwitz. Was a city, nobody knew anything about Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   Q: And how many were in your group when you left from Dora to Buchenwald?
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   A: I have no idea, whole bunch of us, I don’t know. I don’t know how many.
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   Q: And wher -- and where did you think, or -- where did you think you would be going?
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   A: They didn’t tell us. They just move me -- or moved us, we were leaving, and the place was Buchenwald. It wasn’t too far from Dora. The outskirts of Dora, not too far, actually.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   Q: And when you got there, what did you see? March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   A: In Buchenwald’? We saw misery. In Buchenwald it was -- it was a big camp, it was over 80,000 people there. There were boys and girls there, in Buchenwald. That was a huge camp.
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   Q: And where did they put you?
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   A: In barracks, like those -- those bunks, you know, like -- like sardines, one next to another. And it was -- it wasn’t very pleasant at all. The worst of all was the lice. You have so much lice they eat you up alive. You scratch and they nest there, and you scratch more. You couldn’t ask -- you couldn’t tell a doctor or anybody like this that you got hurt, or hurt you or something. You di -- can’t open your mouth and saying anything like that. Once you say you si -- you sick, you’re going.
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   Q: Did you -- wa -- wer-were there lice in the other places that you had been?
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   A: All of them, plenty. Sunday we took out the blanket, put them in the snow, wintertime. You picked them out, there was a perfect square, all dark, with hundreds and thousands pounds of lice. But the couple, two or three days after, they come back, because they -- they -- there -- there was some eggs still there, and they -- you know, they -- they want a body, they come back. Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   Q: So you never went to s -- a so-called infirmary?
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   Q: A-And you said you had lice on your body”? March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   A: Yes, everywhere. Whole clothes, everything was soaked with sa -- with the -- with lice. They eat you up alive, they really did.
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   Q: What kind of work did you do in Buchenwald, or did you do any work?
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   A: In Buchenwald didn’t do anything. I don’t remember doing anything in Buchenwald.
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   Q: So you just sat, during the day?
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   A: Do -- doing nothing, just sit there and do nothing. I didn’t do anything, I don’t remember that.
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   Q: And again, what were your thoughts when you would see German soldiers? What thoughts would be going through your mind when you would see German soldiers, anything?
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   A: You was terrified. You see a new uniform, that -- it was very, very upsetting.
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   Q: Did they ever talk to you?
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   A: They talk, not a nice way. They curse you. They damn you all the time, no matter what. You never do anything right. No matter what you do, it’s still not right.
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   Q: Did you try to make any attempts to escape from Buchenwald?
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   A: No, not in Germany, no.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   Q: Because”?
  </p>
  <p id="620">
   A: Well, it was a foreign land. I just wanted to stay in Poland. Didn’t work, so -- oh no, I wasn’t going to do that, no. Not in -- not in Germany. March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="621">
   Q: And again, when you -- were there any people with you, any young men with you who had come all of the -- 1-in the different camps with you, the same person whether- were -- were there a group of people that stayed with you through all the different camps, or was it every time you went to a different camp there were new people?
  </p>
  <p id="622">
   A: Very few. Some of them did, but not that many, but they moved you around, they split you up, you know. You never knew -- no-not too many from my city. I can count the -- you know, they were with me.
  </p>
  <p id="623">
   Q: Were you an especially close group, those of you from your city?
  </p>
  <p id="624">
   A: A close group, sure, yes.

  <p id="625">
   Q: W-Were you a support to each other, do you feel that that helped you?
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   A: Well we were talking maybe tomorrow we were better, we hope we’ll be liberated. We knew it -- it’s not good, but we hoped tomorrow will be better, that’s it.
  </p>
  <p id="627">
   Q: And so you were in Buchenwald for how long?
  </p>
  <p id="628">
   A: I don’t know. I don’t know, six months, eight, something like that, I don’t know. And then we went to another camp.
  </p>
  <p id="629">
   Q: So for six months you just sat around?
  </p>
  <p id="630">
   A: I don’t remember doing anything in Buchenwald, no.
  </p>
  <p id="631">
   Q: And then they told you you’d be leaving?
  </p>
  <p id="632">
   A: Well, they didn’t tell us, th-they took us one da -- one fine day to another camp.
  </p>
  <p id="633">
   Q: And where was that? March 6, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="634">
   A: That was the last camp, the third camp in Germany, that was Bergen-Belsen, and that’s where we were -- we were liberated by the British at that -- the British liberated Bergen-Belsen. And three days prior to the liberation, they almost killed me. It was very close. It happened on a Sunday. I went down the basement, there we take -- you know, splash up the face with a little water sometime. And I come up with the -- with a can that -- a rusty can that I had -- I find there, and -- it’s water. Sure enough a German standing above, and I’m coming up the steps. [speaks German here] Wh-Where were you? Like he couldn’t see, he wasn’t blind. I said, well I -- I went downstairs to get mi- water. My hands were shaking and I was spilling the water a little bit, and I knew it’s going to be a lot of trouble there. And sure enough, I c -- I get up closer, closer up. He took out the -- the baton, th-the one he had the -- on the side there, the stick. But that was different one, they made it with lead inside it, it’s -- every time he hits you, it break your bone. And [indecipherable] it over the head, and split my head there, and I falls, luckily, I fall forward and not back, because back is further you fell, you -- you wouldn’t be here to tell the story. But I fell forward and I hit the edge and I -- and I couldn’t get up, of course, I was bleeding all over. And I was told that the -- the f -- the- the -- the -- the friends, the one I was sl -- they were sleeping next to each other, they -- they saw me there and they -- they dragged me into my -- into -- into the barrack, in the bunk there, and -- and I was unconscious. I was un -- three -- three days I didn’t go to pick up my bread there, nothing like that, I couldn’t, I couldn’t, I was all March 6, 2007 black and blue and the nose was broken. So anyway they -- when they come there, the British liberated Bergen-Belsen, they took me the portable ambulance, if you will. And they did the best they could, they fix my nose. But they didn’t put it right back, it’s a little bit off [indecipherable] straight, it’s a little bit off. And it can be seen or felt if someone touches. And that was -- that was the closest one I ever come to -- to die. And -- an-and -- and that was it. So I was liberated, and then -- then I have a couple of cousins, I da -- wasn’t with them in same camp. They were liberated by the Americans, and --
  </p>
  <p id="635">
   Q: Were -- you s -- you said that your cousins were 1n your -- in the same camp? Did you say that?
  </p>
  <p id="636">
   A: No, no, I -- in a different camp.
  </p>
  <p id="637">
   Q: Oh, in a different --
  </p>
  <p id="638">
   A: They were liberated by the Americans.
  </p>
  <p id="639">
   Q: -- different camp. B-Before we get to the lib -- the liberation, again, let’s just talk a little more about Bergen-Belsen, did you work there?
  </p>
  <p id="640">
   A: No. No, not in Bergen-Belsen.
  </p>
  <p id="641">
   Q: So again, you just sat.
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   A: Yes. I sat there, yes, that’s all, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="643">
   Q: And I know you had described very movingly, in detail about, in the very beginning of your story, about the young man who tried to escape and was taken to the March 6, 2007 gallows. You obviously had seen a lot of people, dead people in those years since then. Wha -- wha -- how did you -- did you ever get accustomed to seeing dead people?
  </p>
  <p id="644">
   A: You never get accustomed, you see there was every single night people die there. Every single -- never miss one single night and nobody would die, some people died. There were 10 - 15 - 20, even in -- in Buchenwald, it was recorded in 24 hours, 72 death. So had to take the -- the clothes off, drag them out there, put them -- put them outside, and then they come with the wagon, which we have to pull it, and others will put -- put them on the wagons like -- like sticks, you know, they look like sticks, and move them away. Every single day, every single day, never miss a day. There was none on -- any corpses outside. You have to put them outside. Take the clothes off, and put them outside.
  </p>
  <p id="645">
   Q: What does that do to a 18 - 19 - 20 year old to have to do that?
  </p>
  <p id="646">
   A: It doesn’t look good at all, we don’t feel good. We feel well, today is them, tomorrow 1 -- it would be me, maybe. That’s how they feel.
  </p>
  <p id="647">
   Q: Was there a feeling of sadness that you had, or was it fear? What -- what do you think your emotions are when you were forced to see this?

  <p id="649">

  </p>
  <p id="650">
   A: No, there was th -- chicken wire was dividing up, that was the women with the men. There were nothing common, there’s nothing to talk. They were -- they walked March 6, 2007 in their misery, we have our misery [indecipherable] no. There was nothing to talk about.

  <p id="655">
   Q: And for a young man at that age, that must have been difficult. Or was it not on your mind?
  </p>
  <p id="656">
   A: No, that wasn’t on my mind at all, because we have problems.
  </p>
  <p id="657">
   Q: You didn’t have the luxury of thinking about that. When the -- tell me about the liberation, what -- what was it like? I know you were sick, you said, but did you understand what was happening when the British soldiers came? Did you know what was happening?
  </p>
  <p id="658">
   A: I understood what’s happened because they -- they took all the wires down, and -- and th -- and they buried the corpses in -- in -- in the right place the way it should be buried, no-not mass graves. And it was -- it -- it was different ball game altogether. And even after the war -- after the liberation, that is, a lot of -- lot of people died there, by the hundreds and thousands because they’re not used to eat. The stomach -- there wasn’t much of a stomach, it’s all shrunk, then they tried to expand, and they with all March 6, 2007 kinds of diseases and sicknesses, you know, and they couldn’t take it. So a lot of them died. They have all kind diarrheas, and stuff like that. You couldn’t go to the bathroom because there’s only one bathroom an-and 50 or 100 - 200 people wanted to go. So the-they built something the outside, li-like a -- a -- you know, and people go there, outside. Like -- like trenches with -- I don’t know. Anyway, it wasn't very nice, and so after that, like I mentioned, I had the couple of cousins there who were liberated by the- by the Americans. They couldn’t go to every camp, but in the gip -- in the big camps they did go and looked up names. But after the war you -- you can get your own name, you didn’t have any more a number.
  </p>
  <p id="659">
   Q: What -- what was your -- you were given a number? What was your number?
  </p>
  <p id="660">
   A: I can’t remember now, but I got there about six, seven numbers there. I don’t remember that, I don’t look at that.
  </p>
  <p id="661">
   Q: I-In what camp were you given the number? Was it in Germany or in Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="662">
   A: That was in Germany, | think. Yes, anyway, so 1 -- th -- my -- my two cousins, my mitha -- my mother and their father were sister brother, so that makes it -- make us first cousins. So they come and -- and a f-few of th -- few of those big camps like Buchenwald and they come to Bergen-Belsen, look up my name, oh they saw me there [indecipherable] you know and he said, well, what do you have to lose here, let’s go in the medical zone. And I already find mine Aunt Rifka. Nothing do with -- with me, she not relati -- she not related to me at all. Rifka is my cousin’s mother’s March 6, 2007 sister. So nothing to me. She’s already there, but I knew her from -- from the ghetto. So we went to -- in the American zone, and we stayed there in a place named Bamberg, not too far from Nuremberg where those -- those criminals were jud -- you know, judged. And we stayed there and then they wanted to come to America, and I didn’t feel like I wanted to come to America. It’s -- something was bothering me. What it was is, I want to go as far as I possibly can, I don’t have no -- no borders. Although it’s a friendly border here with Canada, but th-the borders upset me in Poland. There was Russians, there were the Germans, none of them were good for the Jews. So they went to America and I went a different direction altogether. I went to Australia. And --
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   Q: Right, right. Well talk about Australia in a minute. Di -- whe-when the British came to you in -- in Bergen-Belsen for -- at liberation, di-did you feel a sense of freedom at that point? What -- what -- what was it?
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   A: I felt a sense of freedom cause I knew I was liberated. And th-the loudspeaker loudly was speaking every language there. You could understand that the food is on the way, and the help is on the way. And -- and we feel good, because the wires came down. Oh, that’s okay. Th-The wire -- the wires came down and -- and we --we knew we were liberated, and that was it.

They -- they -- they encourage me to go and I said no, I don’t want to go to Poland back there, no. So they went and they went to their city, nobody there. They went to my little city where I was born, and there was nobody left there either. See, what they did is they took the people out, the men, to the cemetery, and they dug a -- a trench there, didn’t know what for. And then after they finish, they took all the rest of th -- of the people out there and shoot them and bulldozed them down.
