  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: Of course, radio. We had, and it was all government left Poland, but what to do? Poland was not prepared for war, because we had only twa — 20 years to start to be alone, not divided between our friends, Germany and Russia. Therefore, it was completely too hard even understand why, because Russia is so big [indecipherable] they came first of September came Germany, without telling that we start to — to fight and this is beginning of war. They came, killing as much as possible, bombarding ne — it was a really very hard time. But 17 days later, our friend from Russia came to divide some part for themself. On the beginning they said that, we brought you freedom, we have to help Polish people against ru — Germany. But after a couple — couple months later, they transfer all Polish people to Siberia.

  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: It was very difficult to find bread, because even this places was bombarding them, people couldn’t do nothing, and they didn’t have even flour. Therefore, I remember that my sister — my brother, the oldest, was in an organization which prepared for, from school, after finishing school, high school, and they start to — they send them to — to Lithuanian, I think. These young people. It was very difficult to be there because they wanted to take Polish boys to Russia. And he came v-very — without permission of course, he came back to Warsaw.
