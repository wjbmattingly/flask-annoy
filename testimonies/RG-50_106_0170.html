   Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart, conducted by Gail Schwartz on May 7", 2007, in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side A. What is your full name?
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Answer: David Brombart.
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: And where were you born?
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   A: Born in Brussels, in August 3, 1933.
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: Let’s talk a little bit about your family. How far back, in generations, does your family go, in Belgium?
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   A: In Belgium, no more than three generation.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: And who were they?
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: Well, I think my father came from a little village in Poland called Blaski. He had seven brothers, and my father and his brother immigrated in Belgium, and a brother came in Belgium after the second -- the first World War, okay? One emigrated to Israel and another emigrated to the United States, and the rest were assassinated of course, by -- by the German.
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: Wha- What was your father’s name?
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   A: Aaron. Aaron Brombart, and -- yes. And he came in Belgium, as I found out recently from the Belgium government archive, exactly in 1925. And he only married May 7, 2007 my wi -- my mother, sorry, in °39, because he was engaged 1n a divorce with his first wife, who he married in Poland before he came to Belgium. And there were all those bureaucratic, you know, legal matters were pending. Then, I don’t know exactly when they pronounced the divorce, but what I know, that he ask in 1937, the Polish government to release his mise -- our sister, Sarah, in order for her to come to Belgium.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: So he had a child in Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   A: In Poland, yes, from his first --
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: Wh-Wh-Where -- where was he born in Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: Blaski. Must be a famous village because practically everybody that I -- I met here say they came from Lédz, Blaski and all the sur-surrounding area. Then, he marry first in Poland, before he came to Belgium, and from again, the last documents received from Belgium show that his first wife also came at one moment to Belgium, and I think he arranged all that.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: What was her name?
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A: Very complicated name that I have to find out with --
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Okay, we'll talk about that later.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A: -- with -- yes. And -- but I never had any contact with her, I never saw her except a glance at one ceremony.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Then his relationship with your mother started when? May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: I-It started -- he came in ’25, I-I was born in ’33, then they must have met before that. And there is all kind of story because my mother had two sister, and one sister married a -- a cousin from my father, coming from Poland, and I have photos where he -- he’s seen in -- in this Blaski, the other wearing peasant clothes, he had the nice, you know, jacket and the hat, etcetera. And presumably he was responsible also to bring this cousin to Belgium, too, who married the sister of my -- of my -- of my mother. I think it’s a -- a little complicated still.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Tell me about your mother’s family.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: Well, my fa -- mother family came from Poland, and they were all born in -- 1-in Poland, and they came in -- in -- in Belgium. We have photos etcetera. I think also, °25 - °27. And I don’t know in ’27.
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: Because you said in the beginning your family goes back three generations.
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: No, I thi -- I think it’s not correct.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: Oh, okay. [laughter]
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: I -- is not correct.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: I think it’s two generations maybe.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: It’s just your father.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Yeah. May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Tell me what kind of work your father did.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Yes, he was a -- 1n the ladder, you know. I know that they work, you know, in a little room for 12 hours a day, etcetera. I think for -- for probably two or three years, before he enter in a very successful business of his own. You know, with -- you know, 20 workers or 30, which is --
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Also a ladder business?
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: Yes, a ladder -- a -- a -- and a -- a ladder business. But then came a, you know, a past, you know, story that when he came to Belgium, as -- as I mentioned in another oral history, he went directly to work in the mines, coal mines in Liege for -- for a year. And he had always a connection with the mining industry, not because -- we talk about later, that there was [indecipherable] in the last family who -- who were miners, but h-he took me practically everywhere -- every year back in the mines, you know, to- to see what’s up, I mean, etcetera. And [indecipherable] were before -- a-after we went in the mines, etcetera. That h-he became very, as I mentioned, very successful, but again I -- with all those document, I have no proof that -- of the fact that he went directly to Liege and work in the mines. This is not in the archive of the -- of the Belgium government. They ja -- mentioned that he resided in Brussels, that he had this job, that before he went, there were exchange of letter with the Polish consulate, etcetera. And we mentioned that his salary was X Belgian franks a year, and that he May 7, 2007 was a good worker [indecipherable] and that they will provide housing, etcetera, which was essential for somebody to -- to come to -- to Belgium from Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Okay, now you were born in 1933.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Let’s talk about your family at that time, was it a religious family?
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: No, they were not religious. It was not that. They follow, let’s say, some practice, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Such as?
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: Passover, Bar Mitzvah. I -- | was Bar Mitzvah, too. I was very keen to have all the gifts, but anyway, it was a -- in the Brussels Jewish family, an event, because not only the ceremony took place at the Grand Synagogue in Brussels, but it tooks three -- three days. You know, the first days with -- the banquet was for the immediate family and friends. The second was for my father clients, you know, and the third one was for all his workers. So, you know, th -- it was a big -- a big things.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: But this was after the war.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: No --
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: You’re talking about your Bar Mitzvah?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: Yes, bar mi -- it was just after the war.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: Was just after, okay, let’s get back to before the war.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, before the war? May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Yes. As I mentioned, th-the family of my mother, they came from Warsaw in ’25 - °27, the mother, the father and three sister, okay? And --
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: So these are your grandparents, and your aunts.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: Grandparents, correct, and actually they were all employed by my father, you know, and -- but I was born in the basement of a li -- of the apartment from my grandfather, etcetera.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Where -- where did you -- you live in Brussels? In the center, or --
  </p>
  <p id="53">

  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: In a house or an apartment?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: In -- in an -- a small apartment [indecipherable] a small apartment, but I was born at my grandmother place, and apparently on August the second, but my father went to the city hall on the third, then a-all the papers said I was born on the third. How about that? A-Again, an administrative little problem. And we live in the [indecipherable] some kind of basement and -- until we moved to a -- a bigger apartment. This must be then in -- in °35. [indecipherable] was born in thir -- ’35.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Yeah. Would you describe your family at that time, pre-war, as being middle class - May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: -- upper class?
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: My father was certainly middle class, okay? He -- he prosper at that time. I have only remembrance that h-he was very successful. Many things, all the photos that I have, we spent at the seaside, you know, in Belgium. I remember at that time, you know, there was all those ballroom dancing, etcetera and I remember each time I had - they -- they -- they -- they put in front of the bed all the balloons, all the gift, etcetera, a-a-and -- and things like that. Later, it was a very large room, and my sister was 1n the same room, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Now, this is the sister that was born after you?
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: No, no, no, that’s my half sister --

  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: And she was pregnant when she was deported, yes. That’s -- has been also documented by doctors and all that. Then, many things about -- very nice upbringing, you know, spoiled, like [indecipherable] by my mother, a-and my father, certainly. And -- and the rest of the -- the family, my grandfather was a clockmaker, something May 7, 2007 like that, yes, a-and the other wa -- you know, as I mentioned work in my fa-father business, they never make it at the same level that my father, in term of revenue, income, etcetera. And then came the -- the war, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Yeah, well, we’ll get to that in a minute. Were your parents Zionists?
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Let us say that because he had one of -- of his brother in -- in -- in -- in Israel, I think he was more or less Zionist. He was a member of the -- the Jewish labor bun -- bund [indecipherable]. And this is a very interesting question, because it led to a development later on, when his -- or certainly my mother, were convince that th-there will be not, you know, harm, you know, and therefore th-the -- there was some distance between Zionists, you know, and the belief that th-they will be, you know, recognized as Belgian citizen and so on and s -- and so forth. Then, how -- however, my -- our sister was a leader of the Hashomeritz --
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: Hatzair?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: -- ye -- Hatzair, and you know, she -- she develop into a fantastic girl, and they were -- they were debate if they have to leave for Israel or not, st -- you know? But I think she was one who says we have to go, but it was too late. Too late.

And I remember the people in the family went to pick up some horse meat, you May 7, 2007 know, from the horses who were, you know, dying of that and whatever. And at one moment, must be in the beginning of September or end of August, we saw three American Jeep, you know, passing by. They say hello, but they went.

   A: Yes, it was a [indecipherable] and everybody was happy. People who were like my -- my aunt came back to Brussels, you know. We were to [indecipherable] and the people who were in a camp in Switzerland came back, and they went -- the ones who were in the ca -- escaped to Switzerland. They were -- they were in Kerbene, France for all the [indecipherable] came back. We had a lot of memories, and I remember the discussion then was the situation in Israel, and you know, the -- the -- the independence [indecipherable] Israel and this I remember all that. Some were May 7, 2007 member of the [indecipherable] who wanted the greater Israel, and the [indecipherable] and so on and so forth. I remember that we were, of course, concerned [indecipherable] the Egyptians were 15 miles from Tel Aviv. Of course, there it doesn’t count, everything is so close. We -- and this I remember, and a son from one of my father brothers in Poland also immigrated in Belgium, okay? And he became a famous radiolog, one of the top, you know, doctors in radiology, okay? Write a thousand of book. If you look on the web, you will see his books all over, all over the place. But then came the story that because he was a doctor, he -- he went -- he was asked to join the UN observer in Palestine, you know, during the beginning of the war. And do you know that he took me with him, you know, and I knew that my uncle was there, etcetera. I didn’t -- still don’t understood, but 1t was very fun --
  </p>
  <p id="836">

  </p>
  <p id="842">
   Q: Right now you’re in high school? May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="843">
   A: Oh yes, I was in the high school, okay? And -- but it was ’48 like you -- you mention, and I learned more about the events with Palestine, the creation of the state, about the Egyptian, etcetera, and about international politics. Because m-my uncle was in the UN observer, never observe anything. We were always in the beach in Tel Aviv, you know? And when the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- some other people in the UN says, you know, you have to go and observe the Jewish are doing things like that, they went in another direction. You know, when the -- when the -- th-the [indecipherable] you have to say what they did. Nothing. And you know, we landed in -- not in Tel Aviv, there was no airport, but in Haifa, you know, in the little place of that, and it was fun, except that I took the events seriously, beginning to -- to understand and there -- what was going on. And -- and met some -- my uncle was there, you know, and other member of the family, you -- a-a-and I forgot to mention who I met in Belgium after the liberation. They were in the -- in the Jewish brigade.
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="845">
   A: You see? And the Jew -- I remember the Jewish brigade when th-the -- the allies told the officer of the Jewish brigade, you know, it’s enough, you are killing enough German, you have to be done [indecipherable] any more over there in Germany, in the occupation. Then they came to rest in Belgium. I remember walking very calmly with one of my uncle was the Jewish brigade, etcetera [indecipherable] which I met later, he was in the army, he was in the army paper all the time, and -- and of course May 7, 2007 they departed. And the -- of course explaining that we don’t care about the British, we don’t care about anybody. Want to learn -- want to -- to use the arms, you know, with [indecipherable] as you know in the history in Lebanon th -- and things like that [indecipherable] that was the bi -- the main group, a thousand of them. Okay, then I met them again, anything. And my father joined me at that time also --
  </p>
  <p id="846">
   Q: He came over from Belgium?
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   A: -- from Belgium in ’48, and that was my first trip.

  <p id="848">
   Q: How long were you there for?
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   A: I think three weeks only, because nobody care about this UN business anyway. The same today. [laughter]. Same. It was already clear at that time.
  </p>
  <p id="850">

  <p id="854">
   Q: -- instead he went to the beach, did he purposely not want to observe, or he just wanted to go to the beach?
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   A: No, no, he -- he was one of the -- the many who realized this was a futile exercise, that both the Israeli, the Israeli, we were there, didn’t want them --
  </p>
  <p id="856">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   A: -- to observe anything. May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   Q: So he purposely went to the beach?
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: Yes, like with the other officer -- and -- and -- and after awhile -- I don’t know the details, but I presume the UN says, you know, this is enough [indecipherable] think they won this thing, and you know, there is no point, because there were things that the Jewish did because they had to do it at that time with the arms and things like that. And were not very, you know, acceptable in -- in quotation, but there was nothing else to do, huh? And that’s was it. And --
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   Q: So you came back to Brussels?

  <p id="862">
   Q: Went to -- back to high school.
  </p>
  <p id="863">
   A: Went to high school, and explained the kind of high school, it was a [indecipherable] then the -- the socialist party who -- in Belgium high school, you know, where they train people at that time for the different movement in the sort of -- the co-ops movement, cooperative movement. Of course, does not exist any more, it’s- that thing -- for the health service, because until today the health service is run by political party in Belgium, and [indecipherable] then you are to go in a socialist health plan or Catholic health plan. And there a story with that too. My wife was a very conservative [indecipherable] and didn’t want -- not practi -- religious for [indecipherable] but still today says something against the -- the socialist movement. Anyway, the fa -- my son Eric was born in the socialist hospital. And then she say, n- May 7, 2007 never again, [indecipherable]. Then [indecipherable] my daughter, Sarah, she went to the red -- Red Cross hospital. Then the third one was the political -- you know, strict political party and the other were the -- th-the humanitarian and things like that. End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B

  </p>
  <p id="870">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: Okay. And then because I began to be influenced by politics and [indecipherable] I -- I went to the socialist training center school, okay? With, a-at that time a boarding school, but I didn’t go to -- because it was in Brussels, | didn’t go to the boarding school, and this was an institution delivering a diploma in social work, okay? Again, see, in Belgium you are th -- e-even in 1907, a public school, and a Catholic school May 7, 2007 system, okay? And the third one 1s the state’s system, okay? And for instance, my wife went to the state social training school, okay? And at that time, th-th-th-th-the -- the social worker’s profession was not -- was not recognized as a -- as a university, you know, school. It’s only later, now, that it -- 1t deliver Master, before 1t was only Bachelor. And because I was so involve in this politics that I didn’t even finish th-the - the -- the -- the course. They say, you don’t need it, go immediately into you know, the -- the socialist movement, okay? And we will take you as the leader of the socialist youth. When we say socialist, I have to explain this again to some of our American friend. socialist, in the United State has a communist meaning. Of course, this was not the case, this is social democrats. Like, for the election of the last few days in France, when they call a socialist, he 1s not more socialist than I am, but it -- it -- it is to be understood on the basis -- then I-I -- I went to work for them, but before that, when I was 19 years old --

  </p>
  <p id="881">
   A: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="882">
   Q: -- but -- but -- but let’s talk a little bit more about it, cause this --
  </p>
  <p id="883">
   A: Bar Mitzvah --
  </p>
  <p id="884">
   Q: -- would be 1946.
  </p>
  <p id="885">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="886">
   Q: So --
  </p>
  <p id="887">
   A: Bar Mitzvah --
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: -- you said you had three days of celebration, but what were your thoughts? Did you feel more Jewish after what you had been through, because --
  </p>
  <p id="889">
   A: No. No. I --
  </p>
  <p id="890">
   Q: -- you had to be hidden because you were a Jew?
  </p>
  <p id="891">
   A: -- no, I -- I knew for me it was something linked with the heritage. Something that you cannot -- like my other -- like this doctor tried to -- he said to divorce himself from, you know, the Jewish identity, okay? I know that I was Jewish because we had the -- my friend was Jew -- friend of my father was Jewish. We came to -- to be a -- a member of the Maccabee in -- in Brussels. May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="892">
   Q: But weren’t you angry that because you were Jewish you had to go through what you went through --
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: There was no feelings of anger.
  </p>
  <p id="897">
   A: -- there is no -- no feeling of -- no, it was more the feeling of the stupidity of the entire situation, you know, because of the -- as I tried to mention, if I had anything to say, we were -- we were -- we would have left Belgium even before the invasion, you know, like many did. And it is an accident of, and a tragedy of the Jewish people in history that one -- two brothers came to Belgium, the other went to -- to -- to -- to U.S., and -- and the other ones were -- went to Israel. Then it’s more of that kind of things, because in this political action, there was never any sign of anti-Semitism, any sign of you are Jewish, or not. This never, never, never happen. It may have happened here, in the United States, but not -- and so --
  </p>
  <p id="898">
   Q: But when you -- but for you, 1n growing up, you had no anti-Semitism --
  </p>
  <p id="899">
   A: No, no, no, no. When I went to the army -- you know, when you ask in the army, I want to go there, they just do the opposite, you see? A-And -- and -- and -- and I -- I ended up in the Air Force near a -- we were the few planes that Belgium had, you know? And -- but 1t was very important in my, let’s say, development. Hu -- I became May 7, 2007 totally independent, I didn’t want to hear about my father saying you have to take th -- over the business, or whatever. All this was something else. Okay, I become an activist and -- and -- and developed this whole campaign that no Belgium conscript, draftees, can be sent to Korea -- it was the time of the Korean war.

   A: And -- but 1-1-1n the 70’s, people didn’t want to leave their pro -- because the salary were higher in their own country than internationally, and they were [indecipherable].

It was th-th-th-th-the- the maxima, and, as I indirectly says, began to be associate with the AFL-CIO, and Irving -- y-you know, disclose a lot of his operation in western Europe in -- from Greece, etcetera. We knew -- he -- he told me those are government finance operations now, you know, he begin to talk. And I say yes, I-I say, including the organization you are working in. I say very well. And this was good for me. And when, in ’67, when was in [indecipherable] the disclosure came that all those organization went financed by the CIA -- you see, I say I don’t care a damn [indecipherable] CIA or not. CIA for me is an org -- agency of the U.S. government, and I don’t think if they do many thing [indecipherable] president of the na-national [indecipherable] council or the Congress don’t know, that’s their business.

And the co-ops is -- you know, it’s incredible, it never happen. There is a waiting list of 300 people there. Yi -- they put some -- through somebody, I all -- I don’t know what.

And one month later, my wife want to [indecipherable] it -- I always move and she did all the work, of course. And she -- she came, she say, I’m coming.

Then Irving said to somebody in the main office, give them their bloody containers, you know? And I say, we don’t do that [indecipherable] container. Then the -- the -- the mayor talked to -- to the customs and the custom inspectors say [indecipherable] came to the apartment with the thing, and -- and -- a-and they are [indecipherable] in front of -- in- in the apartment, you know? Okay. This is where we lived for a year and a half, until my wife got totally mad at me, and say, what are we doing here? Because she was reading the paper, and you remember in 64, the houses were 12,000 dollar, and three months free, I don’t know what happen. She said, I don’t stay here with the two little baby. And we began to visit places in New Jersey at the beach, but the commuting was too si -- house -- 20,000 dollar, o-on the beach, you know, etcetera. We went to -- to New Jersey twice.

And he lied to us because he was -- his address was Larchmont, but he May 7, 2007 was really living in [indecipherable]. Then he did access to a beach in Larchmont where he showed us. Then we made one offer, two offer, and finally we bought the house for 36,000 dollar, because I didn’t want to go higher, I say it’s the double of my salary at the time was 75, so it was perfect. I said -- and my wife said [indecipherable] we have to -- to -- to buy in the [indecipherable] only, on the Long Island Sound. I say, I don’t want to hear about that.

That’s the story where [indecipherable] was well ready for us, where we had to -- to live through it. There was no timing, everything was organized, and I was traveling so much, that you know.

   A: No -- yes, but not -- that’s very new [indecipherable] only since I am retired, and that communication came because I -- on -- on [indecipherable] etcetera on the internet, they asking about my daughter, who was until now working for a f -- a German foundation in Germany, and they say, are you this, are you the father, or -- the daughter of this, or that or that. And th-the story with -- with Germany, because of the international thing, I have -- I understood that the German people were not the Nazi, etcetera, though they can be blamed for [indecipherable]. And when she graduate from Boston, through my contact, I knew that they were looking for 105 May 7, 2007 somebody at the German foundations, the socialist one, you know, in -- in Brussels, and then she immediately got the job, you see? And until today -- and [ll tell you in a minute, she’s still the non-German, the only non-German girl in the -- in that foundation. And they paid for a master at the London school of economy. They paid for -- I don’t know how many times, for a -- a German, you know, schooling. And she spent for them seven years in Latin America, you know, until she was brought back to the headquarters in Bond, okay? And now she’s in two years maternal leave, living just on -- in a -- in a house there. And I don’t think she will go back, but that’s another story. She wa -- she like to stay in the U.S., and to be close to her mother, and --

   A: This was not an issue.
  </p>
  <p id="1224">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1225">
   A: Though they know perfectly well that I wa -- I’m Jewish, and my mother was a po - a Catholic, she was Catholic. And the only thing, we took them once in a synagogue, once in a -- in -- ina church. And -- and I didn’t influence them in -- in any theory, or any thing. They said, do you believe in something, I say yes, but I don’t really believe in anything. Then came the word -- the word that I didn’t know exist [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1226">
   Q: Fantastic, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1227">
   A: -- it’s all gimmicks, you know. You know, either you believe, or [indecipherable]. You can say like [indecipherable] I believe in something, or creation, etcetera. I -- I always remember them when I was under the -- in front of the [indecipherable] guys when we are ta -- teaching, you know. One of the first thing they say, the philosophy 107 May 7, 2007 was you know, to put an apple on the table. And they say -- they told you about God, about this and that, all this [indecipherable]. Look at this apple. In a few days you will see insect [indecipherable] coming from the apple. Huh? [indecipherable] came from -- we don’t know the answer, from the universe, and -- and these -- and you see now where they -- at that time they say [indecipherable] or we’ve got natural catastrophe, you know, you co -- you believe what happen in the old time. We have the islands forming, the volcanoes and the belief we -- in God, or 1n the sun, etcetera [indecipherable] people who were not -- they have la -- then they say look, then -- we answer the -- you know. There are many different apples, you know. And so -- actually not. [indecipherable] this one you just [indecipherable] and that’s it, yeah, yeah. No, it’s a -- no, it’s the -- you know, in the -- when I was retired, came this thing with the Belgium, you know, amnesty here and say you can get the [indecipherable] you can think this because then union from the job. And -- and then came this bulletin from the Diaspora, you know, you see. This is a bulletin which is written by a group of progressive Jews in -- in Belgium, were -- who are trying to -- to have the Belgium state recognized, their capability during the war, which has not done, contrary let’s say to -- to France. And who introduced through politicians, some legislation on that, but until now, even under social democrat government they don’t move. They have ceremonies, etcetera in Malines, or in other places where there is Jewish past history, but they don’t recognize the culpability of the state, saying that most of the arrest, 108May 7, 2007 etcetera were done by Belgium policemen and gendarmes. You know, they -- the German were not to be seen too much, but for the Jewish case was this guy named [indecipherable] and many collaborators, you know? The German was using them until a certain point, you know, when, in ’43 they were losing the war, and then they -- they had to -- to compli -- dominate every sector of the population and against the resistance, which was so and so, so and so because after the war, practically everybody was a resister. And -- and things like that. Then -- then that was the -- the case, and it’s only now that they came with this, they ca -- like they came to me with these veteran question. I never ask anything, you know, they say you -- you are Korean veteran, you are a-allowed to get this 500 euro, 700 dollar for this, and [indecipherable] for that. And then they came with the restituti -- [indecipherable] then this group, who was [indecipherable] try also to fight anti-Semitism in Belgium, which you know 1s rising like many place in Europe. Not through violent acts, but through, you know, speeches by the extremist right and things like that. And also they are attacking the -- the -- the Belgium government to av -- agree that all the funds from the restitution be divided between the survivors or the son of the survivors, and -- and given to the creation of a Jewish foundation of things like that. And I became interest because I -- I think, learning what happened here with the claims, with Eisennstadt and with Eggenberger, th-that it’s not acceptable. That the priorities should not be there hundred and hundred of thousand of salaries that they get. Ah, but we were -- we -- the 109May 7, 2007- th-the survivor, and I s -- I ready to say I don’t need it, but there are some people who need it, okay? And -- and -- and then this 1s quite important. Then bu -- they also - other news about this Belgian archive. Then I wrote to the guy, he was a -- he was Jewish, [indecipherable] and -- who send me all those photo and reports and things like that, which I think is -- 1s quite important because there were so many, and answer indirectly your question, I was not brief on when they came, what was their history. You know, anyone 1s that, and what’s -- what happened exactly with my brother, my father-in-law, with my mother’s resistance to all that, I -- wha -- wha -- what 1s the truth was not the truth, you know, in this thing. Then it was very important. And this led me to -- to ask about this interview. You see, this is the chronology of the thing. And Arnheim said yes, it’s very important that there 1s a second step, that all documentation is in fact, used, 1n a way that you have nothing extraordinary to tell, a- and I -- I know that. It’s just one experience, okay, and it’s not the same experience that the -- th-the -- my father was really hidden in the house, couldn't go out , okay? There were some children also in the same situation. And children were denounced by people and send into camp. O-Or my friends sent in a convent or a monastery. Then the situation is very, very, very different. But -- but st -- End of Tape Three, Side A 110May 7, 2007 Beginning Tape Three, Side B

   Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with David Brombart. This is tape number three, side B. Do you feel that you lost your childhood since you were away from your family for so many years?
  </p>
  <p id="1229">
   A: No. I don’t have this feeling. I think, as I tried to explain, the early childhood was so gratifying, the memories are all good. A little travel to Holland, I photo -- visited the tulip plants, you know, and I --

   A: Good in term of -- of family life, of -- as I mentioned, travel and gifts, when they were going out and the arrival of -- of Sarah from Poland etcetera. You see how close, or immediately she develop well, and it was so [indecipherable]. And -- okay, 111 May 7, 2007 and th-the war year were some kind of an interruption. Because afterwards, I was again spoil like hell from my father and traveling and -- and very close, Didn’t want him to marry or something -- I didn’t say that, etcetera. Traveling all the time. Absolutely no -- no -- no problem. Bar Mitzvah and -- and --
  </p>
  <p id="1238">
   Q: Did you feel very Jewish at your Bar Mitzvah?
  </p>
  <p id="1239">
   A: Oh no, no, no. They tried to tell me all kinds of -- of ne -- knowledge, you see, and I did learn the Hebrew, I could recite, because there was some school you had to go to in the summer. To the synagogue school --
  </p>
  <p id="1240">
   Q: You went to a -- you went a -- a Hebrew school, a synagogue school?
  </p>
  <p id="1241">
   A: Went for the synagogue --

  </p>
  <p id="1246">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1247">
   A: For the Hebrew knowledge. All this was good, but I -- I was not interested. Then I didn’t know what was happening, huh? Then my father, with his three days of ceremony and all that, gifts and gifts, and people who came even stole some things out of my [indecipherable]. A-A-And -- and -- no -- and -- no, I told you th -- the only 112 May 7, 2007 time I feel Jewish, when I was asking to get out for a week from the army. And that -- a-a-and that was quite important, but afterwards really, I was not view like that, okay? Even not in my work in the Arab countries, you know, because of my appearance, I could go anywhere I want in the Arab country, they take me for an Arab.
  </p>
  <p id="1248">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="1249">
   A: When I went -- I remember very well in Tunis once, 1-1n front of the hotel there was some kind of a incident, I don’t know what, but anyway, I was looking what’s -- may have happen, you see? Then the older man began to -- to scream at me in Arabic, and I said, but I don’t speak Arabic. You see, all those young people, Tunisians, you know, speak some French now, you know, sh -- speak Arabic, etcetera. I say okay. May -- ma-many speeches are everywhere in the Arab country, but 1t was always in French of cour -- of course, huh? Now, the question would be very different, because of the Islamic influence. You know, who penetrates every fiber of -- of society in those places, will be difference, very different. We would not have been welcomed like I was [indecipherable] you know, a defender of the liberty and independence and they o -- they ask -- we were in [indecipherable] to -- to -- for so many things, including shipment of f-food, under -- you know, the p -- I think it was called PL40 program of the United States to send food abroad, all this or that. Immediately once one of their people were arrested, we were going there, we freed them, you know, etcetera. No, no, no, no -- that’s not possible any more. Not possible. 113 May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="1250">
   Q: When you -- you -- you talked about the rise of this militant Islam.
  </p>
  <p id="1251">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1252">
   Q: How do you react to that, considering the fact that your life, your childhood was changed by the rise of some -- you know, a dictator that --
  </p>
  <p id="1253">
   A: Yeah. Well --
  </p>
  <p id="1254">
   Q: -- deprived people of their civil rights
  </p>
  <p id="1255">
   A: Yeah, yeah, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="1256">
   Q: Do you feel more of a connection, cause he -- you had more direct effects from that?
  </p>
  <p id="1257">
   A: Ah, yes, and you know, it’s the general knowledge of the danger of authoritarianism and dictatorship and the rise of it and the fact that in Europe, twice the United States had to come to rescue them, that they did it. It’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a -- 1-1t’s a -- a continent who has been so much involved in internal struggles, going back to Napoleon and etcetera, and the same mistake to try to 1 -- to rule in the su -- these large territories of the Soviet Unions. In -- in that sense we saw some parallel with the Islam, the raise of Islam.
  </p>
  <p id="1258">
   Q: But my point is, do you have more of a visceral reaction? Do you know what I mean?
  </p>
  <p id="1259">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1260">
   Q: More emotional, because your life was changed by it? 114 May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="1261">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1262">
   Q: By that.
  </p>
  <p id="1263">
   A: Yeah, yes and no, it’s more on the political level again, because I was in charge of a program called -- the first program called Islam against the Islamists, to make the difference between the two, you see, and -- and -- and again, there’s nothing religious, it is a group of power monsters, who will do anything to access to the control of a state, uh-huh, and the -- in the Koran, everybody knows that 1-1-it’s -- it’s like the Catholicism, a-and -- and the other form, built on the -- o-on an evolution, which -- which show only that with the raise of Islam, we see that they are as primitive like the Catholics were hundreds of years ago, of the Jewish, etcetera. Then this is more on that kind of level, and the fact that this has to be -- has to be stopped because there are new factors, okay, meaning -- especially in western Europe, with the immigration from our country. We have the problem here, we have another, the Latin American immigration, etcetera, who 1s different, of course, from the Jewish immigration, or the Belg -- the Belgium. I found in the paper so many story where Belgium descendent, even this -- to make a joke, this D.C. Madame, you know, etcetera, she is born in -- in a place in Pennsylvania called Charleroi, who is a -- a name of a city, mean you find, more or less, and in the [indecipherable] you find, you know, that’s moving, when they say, he was in the Battle of the Bulge, you see, or before a -- y -- many, many, many things 115May 7, 2007 when -- went to that [indecipherable] it’s full, I mean the -- in the book. And many thing, many way. Ah, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1264">
   Q: Do you -- you have a d -- a duel citizenship?
  </p>
  <p id="1265">
   A: I have now a double citizen. Before it was not possible. I mean, when I came here from Belgium, you renounce your Belgium nationality.
  </p>
  <p id="1266">
   Q: You renounced your --
  </p>
  <p id="1267">
   A: But then again, the notion of citizensh --
  </p>
  <p id="1268">
   Q: Was that painful for you to renounce it?
  </p>
  <p id="1269">
   A: Ma -- no. That was not -- not all. Because I made such a difference between a heritage and a situation. And -- and -- and I never asked to go in the Belgian army to defend so-called the king, okay? The king, for me, was a -- a collaborator, the first one, during the war, of course, huh? Meaning that I put this all in -- in perspective. And I didn’t come, mind you, American before, I was here seven years. You have to wait five years, a -- two more years, and as w-we talk about the legendary Irving Brown, he say, you know, one thing done, forget your heritage, okay? And -- and I -- he was more French than American anyway, live in Europe all his life. I recognize from one of the best [indecipherable] in France, etcetera, then it doesn’t mean an -- really, when you have this international outlook. This is when somebody say, oh you -- your daughter work in Germany. I say, ah, I know -- w-w -- there’s no meaning. She could have work in Italy or something else. What is important with -- with all that, a- 116 May 7, 2007 and th-the race of Islamic, you know, 1-infiltration in ji -- 1-1-in the labor movement, in political life and in the society, 1-1s ta -- to remember that Europe is still divided between many [indecipherable] and the case of Bosnia, Serogovia, the fall of Yugoslavia. I say everybody can be tomorrow a murderer if you -- 1f you don’t pay atten -- e-everybody can be manipulated in their thinking, in one way or the other, very easily. Where people can be convinced, you know, that Clinton was a great president, or you know, it may be, maybe not, but anyway, he’s not one of the greatest in this country anyway. A-And -- and the same can be said from -- from the president, who is now here. It 1s a -- a -- a -- a State of the development of country, of nation, and of the political life. What we can control, and what we cannot control. What a free society means. And now came all those great [indecipherable] thinker even today, in [indecipherable] etcetera. He said, election is not a proof of democracy. But we knew this many, many years, that you know, the fact impose, practically, an election, doesn’t mean anything in many countries of the world. Either it’s still tribal and you talk about feeling of nationality there -- th-th-th-th-their responsibility is vis-a-vis their tribe. It’s not the [indecipherable] their country. And there is nothing in this concept of country, of nation. They simply do not exist.
  </p>
  <p id="1270">
   Q: Well, you -- I know you talked about, you know, feeling very international, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1271">
   A: Yeah. 117 May 7, 2007
  </p>
  <p id="1272">
   Q: -- obviously traveling all over the world. Do you have any particular feelings about Germany because of World War II?
  </p>
  <p id="1273">
   A: Oh, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="1274">
   Q: Are you comfortable when you’re there, when you visit?
  </p>
  <p id="1275">
   A: I wa -- no, I visit two or three time, I’m not comfortable.
  </p>
  <p id="1276">
   Q: Why not?
  </p>
  <p id="1277">
   A: I think, you know -- I remember in Berlin, sitting in -- in -- in a restaurant, you know. There were some very old couple. I think th-th-they look at me, you know, and they may -- and I’m -- and they must have been, you know, concentration camp guards, who else, you know, and thing li -- you don’t know. You don’t know. Going to Germany two, three -- I went to Berlin in fir -- first time in ’56, you know, and -- and the question was not the old Germany, it was the east Germany, you know, a-and the west Germany, what we do to rebuild them, and th -- the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the -- the acceptance of a occupation policy, who was not very wi -- wi -- all the aspect of which are not -- we cannot be very proud, because we use, you know, th-the-the police, we use -- etcetera, you -- 1-1s simply bring back of what the contemporary situation with Iraq, where we did not want to use the army in the [indecipherable] of Saddam. And the fact that we didn’t do that was a great mistake, because we didn’t do it in Germany, but -- or in Japan, certainly not. Then -- no, I feel co -- uncomfortable there. But I must say I feel uncomfortable in every -- any country where I don’t know 118May 7, 2007 the language, or they don’t understand, you know. I -- I -- I never went, because of political reason -- well, I went afterward -- to Spain or Portugal, because they were under dictatorship and we find -- that’s when I was in the young [indecipherable] | went back --
  </p>
  <p id="1278">
   Q: So it’s interesting, it’s because of your professional background --
  </p>
  <p id="1279">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1280">
   Q: -- and your political background, not because of your childhood experiences.
  </p>
  <p id="1281">
   A: No, no, no, no. This immediately, you know, dissipated, because of -- of -- I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="1282">
   Q: Have you met other hidden children?
  </p>
  <p id="1283">
   A: Oh yeah, sure. Sure, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="1284">
   Q: And do you feel a connection to them?
  </p>
  <p id="1285">
   A: Oh yeah, sure, sure. Either because I -- I think I refer -- we were member of the Maccabee. Even though -- and Maccabee was a, as you know, mo-mostly a sports, you know, activity. We had the gymnasium, and the ping pong, etcetera. But they -- there were some lecture, you know, on -- on Jewish life, etcetera. There were artistic group, etcetera. And we knew that we choose Maccabee, not to be in the Zionist group, or not to be in the traditional Orthodox Jews, which didn’t exist anyway in Brussels, they were all in Antwerp, you see. And -- and then we -- we had many debates, you see? But the ones who are here were the -- the ones who -- who -- who 119 May 7, 2007 decided to -- to move on, you know, with the briti -- with the Jewish background and - and that’s it. Many people like me went very early to Israel, and we ca -- went back - | went back twice or three times.
  </p>
  <p id="1286">
   Q: Do you feel a special connection to --
  </p>
  <p id="1287">
   A: Oh yes, sure. Sure. This is another issue. This was the Jewish state and this was the- let’s say an history was started much earlier, under the British empire and [indecipherable] and all that, yes. And of course we will -- defended -- there’s no -- no -- when I visit the afri -- the -- the Arab countries, my boss, Irving Brown at that time, when we were in Tunis [indecipherable] the Palestinian came a-and want to talk to Irving. Irving says, go to David. He didn’t want to talk to them. Then we sit down and I said, glad to talk to you, okay, but if you raise the question of Israel, there’s no deal, okay? Can talk about anything you want. At that time they didn't even want -- they were not talking about a Palestinian states or nothing. They want just to be anti-Israeli and a colonial state, or an imperial state. I had many contact, but again, through the years he became very dangerous, you know, in terms that we were close from the -- the exile group, even from inside and outside the Tunisian of the [indecipherable] Algeria. And people were -- my friend were assassinated. It is another story, I can tell you where we had, for instance, the liberation movement against the French in Algeria. I visited the border [indecipherable] kind from Tunisia, Morocco, all that. But the people we are dealing with were eliminated by 120 May 7, 2007 their own people after they took independence, you know, their friends had been torn out from this -- from stairways and things, oh, terrible. Some were assassinated in Paris, which I knew and I was very con -- of course, concern about it. But again, when you talk to a -- a guy like Irving Brown, he accepted that [indecipherable] and never talk about that. His best friend die [indecipherable] never talk about that. And we were involved in all kind of operation, etcetera, and -- and as a joke with my wife and children, when I was awarded, you know, commander honor of this award, national award, you know, th -- of this officer, of that, and the other, and chevalier -- knights of that. Senegal and -- and Doumay, and -- Senegal, Doumay, and oh, what’s the third? Togo, huh. And I came back each time so proud of the men [indecipherable] that they laugh at me. And the na -- the big, you know, diploma, I wanted to put this in my little [indecipherable] no, no. It’s only -- it’s a true story, of course, like everything I told you, of course. I brought it from the basement and I put it back, two of them. One is too big in the -- in my guestroom, and the other one is too big, I -- I left in that. And then people are asking me, but why did you get? I say, look, this is to organize a ch -- regime change, the other was to oppose one. And -- and things like that. But that’s another aspect, and I think it’s very well describe in -- in several books.
  </p>
  <p id="1288">
   Q: What was your reaction during the Eichmann trial, do you remember?
  </p>
  <p id="1289">
   A: Oh yes, of course. We were all in favor of it, and I think my wife wants nothing to do with all that -- with [indecipherable] conservative says, why a trial? Kill him 121May 7, 2007 [indecipherable] you know? It’s like what she said things about the -- the unfortunately situation with the killings in school, etcetera [indecipherable] I say, why do you go thr -- they go all through that, you know?

   Q: Well, I was wondering, did 1t make you think of the loss of your mother, the loss of your sister?
  </p>
  <p id="1291">
   A: Oh yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="1292">
   Q: Did it -- did it bring you right back?
  </p>
  <p id="1293">
   A: -- th-the -- oh no, the -- yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1294">
   Q: That’s what I meant.
  </p>
  <p id="1295">
   A: Yeah, the whole tragedy o-of that period, of course. And when there 1s -- I don’t know whether before, I was going some movie a-about, you know, Eichmann arrest, or about the -- the thing, but you know, in the book on the Belgium deportation that there is upst-upstairs [indecipherable] that I have it at home, you know, with the list of the convoy, etcetera, there is, at the end, the trial in Kohn, Germany of the mi -- the one who did all that in Belgium, okay? H-he went free after five years. Then, for me it’s another a-aspect, it’s a -- it’s really showing that -- that the society evolves, that this thing of remembrance, it’s -- 1-1-1-1t’s something personal, but when you are involve in all those acts, there is no justice, you know, only for the few. [indecipherable] Nuremberg and all that, it’s only a few, what, 20 people, or 50 people. Of course, what we did with denazification in Germany was excellent, of 122 May 7, 2007 course, excellent. And th-there became, like in Italy, etcetera, recognition that people have to live with the regime that they have, you know, and as I mentioned before, the populace, the people are -- are subject to so much more [indecipherable] that today’s- even an election in a s-so-called civilized country has different meaning for different people.

  <p id="1296">
   Q: What is your feeling coming into the Holocaust Museum building?
  </p>
  <p id="1297">
   A: The first time? I went there three times. I went here --
  </p>
  <p id="1298">
   Q: No, I’m talking about this --
  </p>
  <p id="1299">
   A: Yeah, yeah, I went --
  </p>
  <p id="1300">
   Q: -- th-this one in Washington.
  </p>
  <p id="1301">
   A: -- three time. Oh yes. I decided --
  </p>
  <p id="1302">
   Q: Do you have any emotional reaction when you come to it?
  </p>
  <p id="1303">
   A: No, I have more -- better illustration of some of the -- th-the situation. I went to -- in the [indecipherable] where you can follow the deportation on the screen, you know? Then I look at Belgium and I say, that’s not enough, it’s not even very -- it’s quickly done. I don’t think that they show any -- you cannot s -- have any remor -- or any comment, you know. I-I went back because they have something of a list, my aunt who ca -- before she fa -- came here and then before she died -- you know, there is -- her name is on it, but her husband name is not on it, you know. Certainly mine is not on it, because I never put it, nobody ask, you see? The best place is the reflection, you 123May 7, 2007 know, pool there, with the wall, that’s important. But to go through a place with all the photos of -- of people deport -- I’ve seen that, I-I -- you know, it has no -- you know, I’ve -- this I know about Belgium, etcetera. This I know. And to have a little [indecipherable] around Belgium doesn’t mean, you know, anything. Because they concentrate on Poland, on the big countries.

   Q: Do you belong to any hidden children organizations?

  <p id="1306">
   Q: I mean, here in the United States?
  </p>
  <p id="1307">
   A: Oh, no, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1308">
   Q: That’s [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1309">
   A: I tried to contact one, I saw somebody testify in front -- before the Congress. Some guy who -- who supposed to have a group to defend the survi -- the children of the survivors, etcetera. I look on the Web, and I couldn’t find him. But no, I am -- I was really, lately, interested in that, and it’s only because I -- I was on the -- with this Belgium, you know, all these thing that they put on, and -- and that I pursue [indecipherable] this thing, but I would not be member of anything. I’m never ask anything, ju -- this thing really, has been practically through in my head, but -- and I accepted it, voluntary. I would not have accepted 50 years ago, I never accepted it. And while on the basis of all those things, you are [indecipherable] you are not accepted if you have receive compensation from the German claim. You know, you May 7, 2007 cannot have both. And now I know that some people got German ca -- oh yes, a lot of them, but they cannot get this [indecipherable] etcetera, because you are -- which is totally incomplete. I don’t know if I have to say that. You ge -- you put the wrong address, you don’t take that. And with this whole business of the non-payment of an insurance premium was just --

   Q: Is -- is there -- is there anything else you wanted to add to the interview --
  </p>
  <p id="1313">
   A: No, that --
  </p>
  <p id="1314">
   Q: -- or do you feel you’ve expressed your thoughts?
  </p>
  <p id="1315">
   A: -- no, I am pleased to -- on this opportunity, for what it may be worth, and I think it’s a kind of a -- of a normal, let’s say duty in terms that I know more because of this research being done, okay? Maybe with the money, and I didn’t find anything there, I didn’t find anything in the Holocaust Museum. Of course, I went to Israel each time on the [indecipherable] and in passing through the alley of the -- the -- the [indecipherable] of the hide people, th -- you know, th-the -- the ones who save, I say, the people I went -- were hidden from will never be there, because I will never, even they save my life, suggest that they should be there.
