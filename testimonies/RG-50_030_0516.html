He said, no, we ate already. But later it seems that there was no food for them, just for me they had some food now. They sacrificed everything because the family always said, when I came from high -- elementary school, why don’t you let her work and make some money and help you? No, they said, we don’t do that. So they send me- was a Special high school. Very hard to learn, you learned all the languages and we had to learn all the books to read in every language, we had to learn poems in every language.

  </p>
  <p id="407">
   A: We had to get I.D.’s. I have one with me. And my parents had an J on it, and I didn’t have to because I only knew two Jewish grandparents, and according to Hitler, you was not Jewish, and I was someplace when we were picked up, and the men didn’t know anything about Jewish [indecipherable] father was Jewish. And he really was not Jewish according to the Jewish religion, you are what your mother is. And he was picked up and sent away and so I didn't have to have a J. I didn’t want to be without my parents. So I took it and you could -- you couldn’t go out after eight o’clock, nobody could go out any more. And the Jews only could shop between three and five, things like that. But nothing really happened til °42.

We had the radio -- see, we had the radio what you could rent and pay every month, four stations or something. And then they brought an regular one, a nice one. Well, that we could not keep, you know. We have to turn that in.
  </p>
  <p id="424">
   Q: You had to turn that in?
  </p>
  <p id="425">
   A: Yeah. Not everybody did that but we did.

  <p id="427">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="430">
   Q: -- it’s like a pain in the neck, right?
  </p>
  <p id="431">
   A: Yeah, but it was for other people too, they couldn’t listen to radio from England, and I always listen to radio from England. And that you couldn’t do.
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   Q: That you couldn't do -- right.
  </p>
  <p id="433">
   A: That’s why they took it from everybody, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="434">

  <p id="447">
   Q: Did it have a J on it?
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   A: Yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="450">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   A: Yeah, that was my choice, for me yeah, cause I didn’t have to. Because when I worked in the office still, the lawyer went through the German embassy and got a paper for me that they could not do anything to me because I was not supposed to have a J, but they didn't take it off. And I always had to carry that with me, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   Q: And so that was in 1941?
  </p>
  <p id="454">

  </p>
  <p id="459">
   Q: Did you have to put on a Jewish star because --
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   A: I did.
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   Q: You did?
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   A: Yeah, but I didn’t always use it because nobody knew I was Jewish, so when they left, you know. And Joe and I, we went sometimes someplace.
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   Q: But did people know that your parents were Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   A: Yeah, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   Q: So wouldn’t they then assume that you were Jewish, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   A: No, I don’t know if they thought about. Maybe I took it off later. I got --
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   A: -- don’t know exactly.

  </p>
  <p id="472">
   A: No, no I’m not the scary type, no, no, no.
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   Q: You’re not -- you’re not the scary type?
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   A: Joe was more than I was.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   Q: But when you started to see the deportations, when they started to take Jews and bring them to Westerbork -- well, you had heard about Westerbork before, because it was started by --
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah --
  </p>
  <p id="477">

   Q: He can’t work.
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   A: -- he could not [indecipherable] no. He -- they put him in a work camp. They did all the Jews, from the big company there, and every day they came home. Til one time, after maybe about three, four weeks, they didn’t come home, and they were sent to Westerbork.
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   Q: And they were sent to Westerbork.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   A: And then the next day -- that was Fridays, and on Saturdays they came to pick up the wives and the kids.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   Q: And did you know he was in Westerbork, or you didn’t know where he was?
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   A: Yeah, we -- oh, we knew that, we heard that, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   Q: And that’s up north, and you were at Amsterdam so it’s a bit --

  </p>
  <p id="501">

  </p>
  <p id="502">
   A: We went through someplace where everybody went, and somebody asked -- my mother said that I was a minor. I was already 20 [indecipherable] didn’t have to show anything. He said okay, he said, go home. So we could go home. And it didn’t --
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   Q: And they ju -- they believed you?
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   Q: He believed it?
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   A: Oh yeah. I don’t know if it was a Dutch guy or a German. And you know, they say too, if I don’t pick you up now, then somebody else will pick you up later, you know, so they let us go. So my mother stayed in the [indecipherable] about almost a year.
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   Q: Before you -- there was another arrest.
  </p>
  <p id="508">

  </p>
  <p id="513">
   Q: But that was difficult, you probably --
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   A: Oh yeah, but -- my mother had to sell some rings, and all that. But we made it.
  </p>
  <p id="515">

  <p id="520">
   A: Mm-hm. I don’t know how she did it all, but she did.
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   Q: She did. Do you think she got money from her sister?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="526">
   A: The rich were -- went in hiding, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="527">

  </p>
  <p id="528">
   A: Well, yeah, but she -- I had [indecipherable] at home, she was all ready if they came upstair -- they came up, sometimes by the people to see if the no -- people were living. And there’s one time for my mother, said, she is not here, and I told her, go in that closet. And said, no, she’s gone already, long time. And they were talking and talking, and she got -- later she told me she was nervous because she was afraid something would happen when sh -- they left luckily, and then she came out. And we told her, you know? But -- and she went outside sometimes too, what she shouldn’t have done, but --
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   Q: Did she look Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="530">

  <p id="537">
   Q: You don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   Q: Why would she go outside? She didn’t care? Or it was --
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   A: Yeah, well she couldn’t stay in the house all the time, she always liked to have people around and stuff like that there.
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   Q: And was she wearing a Jewish star, or had she taken it off?
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   A: No, no, she had one.
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   Q: So it was clear that she was Jewish if she’d go outside?
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   Q: But she was okay for about a year?
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   A: That was in October, maybe a half a year or something like that, yeah, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="549">
   Q: And then there was another arrest. Were you both arrested again?
  </p>
  <p id="550">
   A: Yeah, yeah. Somebody must have told on us, and we both were, yeah. We had to go to a theater, and there were a lot of people, family too, and other people, and usually people, they were mixed marriage, we had friends, she was not Jewish, he was, they came out. On -- that time, nobody came out. I was the only one. So they asked, anybody here that thinks they can get free? [indecipherable] I said, I don’t want it. And my mother says, go up front. And she push me and then she says, yes. So I told him. I says, yeah, I said, I am born in Germany, and my parents didn’t care if I was German or not, there, and they took care of me and all that, and I have an I.D. [indecipherable] So he said okay. He says, you can go. So it was night already. I had to go across the street, was in a -- in a -- for children that went with people in the -- well, they went there, for children, so I had to go there. And somebody working in that theater, and I knew he lived across the street from Joe. So I told him, says, tell Joe that I come out tomorrow morning. So next morning I came out and I walked a little and there he came with a friend. His mother had my dog, and you should hear that doggie. Everybody was looking. He was so happy he screamed and screamed when he saw me. And -- and that was it. But what I did, was a good thing I did get the key from the apartment. Found after people were taken out, the Germans came and took all the furniture out. Everything. So I told Joe, said, what are we gonna do? And he said, you know, I told my other neighbor, he was Jewish, his wife was not, so he -- he had no trouble and he lived on the fourth floor, but he slept in veranda [indecipherable] porch-like, in the back. And what they did, they took all the nice furniture, put that down with the cable, I don’t know how they did it, and up to that guy’s house. He helped us. So, and what we -- was no good, we put in the front and they picked that up. So lucky that I have the key. And then somebody find out, his mother told [indecipherable] and somebody that the neighbors downstairs has a sister and she likes to live in that house. Was a beautiful apartment, was all new. Had bathroom, now nobody had an bathroom in Holland, except if you was rich. And -- and she told him, and Joe said to me, listen, we have to go someplace else. So we found an ap --
  </p>
  <p id="551">
   Q: Let -- le-let -- let me ask you something. When did you actually meet Joe the first time?
  </p>
  <p id="552">
   A: Oh, I knew always, when they lived on top of me.
  </p>
  <p id="553">
   Q: And so you were what, how old when you first met?
  </p>
  <p id="554">
   A: I was only couple years younger, ma -- I still went to school. I was still a girl --
  </p>
  <p id="555">
   Q: So you were [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="556">

  </p>
  <p id="557">
   Q: I see, so you were 14 or 15?
  </p>
  <p id="558">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="559">
   Q: And you fell in love right away?
  </p>
  <p id="560">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="561">
   Q: No?
  </p>
  <p id="562">
   A: He didn’t pay attention to me.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   Q: He didn’t pay attention?
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   A: No, and I had a boyfriend and also, know?
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   A: Til later in the war, then my hus -- my mother gave some food for -- his father was in the hospital, and his mother picked it up. And then she saw me, and she told him, boy Joe, you should see how she changed. She said, you have to come. So they both came, and that was it.
  </p>

   Q: So it’s -- uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="570">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="571">
   Q: So that was when you were -- when it was 1941 or 1942 --
  </p>
  <p id="572">
   A: No, that was in ’40 -- let me see. Father wasn’t there any more. Must be close to ’43.
  </p>
  <p id="573">
   Q: Closer to *43.
  </p>
  <p id="574">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="575">
   Q: So it’s rather late that you become very close --
  </p>
  <p id="576">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   Q: -- but it -- 1t’s rather immediate, once that happens?
  </p>
  <p id="578">
   A: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="579">
   Q: Right. So he’s somebody you want to lean on and call when --
  </p>
  <p id="580">
   A: No, we went --
  </p>
  <p id="581">
   Q: -- because you give a message when -- when you leave your mother. You gave a message to someone that Joe should come and pick you up, that you would be --
  </p>
  <p id="582">
   A: No, that was in the theater, where we were.
  </p>
  <p id="583">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="584">
   A: And they were all transported to Westerbork.
  </p>
  <p id="585">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="586">
   A: And I came out.
  </p>
  <p id="587">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="588">
   A: And then I told somebody to tell Joe that I was coming out.
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   A: And then he picked me up, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   Q: Now, how --
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   A: And we were going [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   Q: Did you feel funny leaving your mother in the theater?
  </p>
  <p id="594">
   A: Of course, mm-hm. I had s -- s -- I still thought maybe, you know, that they would come home. I didn’t know what they were doing that time. They never made that public.
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   A: You know?
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   Q: Right. But your mother was very clear.
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   A: Oh, she knew.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   Q: She knew.
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   Q: And she wanted you out of there.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   Q: So then Joe picks you up with the dog and a friend --
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   Q: And it’s your -- it’s the dog, it’s the Maltese dog, the one --
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   Q: -- that guarded you. And how did he get the dog?
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   A: His friend’s parents took him, when Joe’s parents had already dogs, mm-hm. She -- they took care of him.
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   Q: Right. So, it’s clear that you shouldn’t stay in the apartment where you were staying, right?
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   Q: And Joe thinks you should have --
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   A: Now, but somebody had to call that I lived there and they would pick me up --
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   A: -- so, and Joe, too, and he was not supposed to live there either.
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   Q: And -- and why was j -- Joe was vulnerable also. They were -- they were sending boys to Germany, is that right?
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   A: Yeah, Germany, yeah. And his boss was working for a German company, and he was a little anti-Jew. And he know that Joe was going with me, and that -- he gave him up to -- for Germany. And he went there to the labor, there’s a labor office where you go, and I went with him, and he said -- he went there, and they have to report we never went to Germany. So he was really at risk, too, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   Q: Right, because he was refusing to go.
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   A: Sure, yeah. Every young person had to go.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   Q: Right, right. So how did he find -- where did he find a place, another place for you to go?
  </p>
  <p id="620">
   A: Oh, there was something, you know, as a part of the city, an apartment, so --
  </p>
  <p id="621">
   Q: And you then had a fake name, right? Is that right?
  </p>
  <p id="622">
   A: Then I got it -- then he got it for me, yeah. Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="623">
   Q: You had an -- you had a fake I.D.
  </p>
  <p id="624">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="625">
   Q: And what was your name then?
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   A: Karin Magteld [indecipherable] I guess, yeah.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="755">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="756">
   A: And then you could get some food. And he got one for me too, someplace. So -- well there was not much food anyway, but -- and then, before the war was over, I think, on America, they sent on the Red Cross, they sent food over. And then everybody who had a ration card, you could get some.
  </p>
  <p id="757">

  </p>
  <p id="770">
   A: -- and he could not, mm-hm.

  <p id="777">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="778">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="779">
   Q: Did you -- when the war was over did you try to look for your parents? Did you think that maybe they were alive, or did you think that they were gone?
  </p>
  <p id="780">
   A: No, we heard then what happened and all, yeah. Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="781">
   Q: So it was clear.
  </p>
  <p id="782">
   A: Yeah. I couldn’t find anything, no. Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="783">
   Q: And was there anybody from that family who was alive?
  </p>
  <p id="784">
   A: Oh, an s-second cousin came by, and that was -- and I had one second cousin girl that she -- she was in hiding too, and she worked in a nursing home, and we went there sometimes and she came over my house to meet her boyfriend who was in hiding too. And she was -- yeah, she was the -- really the only one. And then my mother’s sister, who was rich, she came out of hiding with her husband, and so I had her. That was the only family we had.
  </p>
  <p id="785">
   Q: So it was a very difficult time then --
  </p>
  <p id="786">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="787">
   Q: -- when liberation came --
  </p>
  <p id="788">

  <p id="791">
   Q: -- you can’t go back to -- to what you were.
  </p>
  <p id="792">
   A: Oh no. Mm-hm. And Joe couldn’t find a job of nothing. So what he did -- my father had the textile license and he took that and he bought textile and he st -- was standing on the market with textile, to make some money. Well, you only could buy it on ration cards, you know? [indecipherable] by points. Like a handkerchief would be five points and a towel would be 10 points, something like that, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="793">
   Q: So, to be th-these textiles he had to --
  </p>
  <p id="794">

  <p id="795">
   Q: -- use the ration cards?
  </p>
  <p id="796">

  <p id="798">
   A: No, not in Amsterdam, really.
  </p>
  <p id="799">

  <p id="810">
   A: °44.
  </p>
  <p id="811">
   Q: °44.
  </p>
  <p id="812">
   A: The first. And then I got the other one about three and half years later, mm-hm. And we moved from that apartment where we lived during the war, and somebody, an uncle from Joe lived in a nice house, first floor. And was too much money for him, so we -- you couldn’t get a house of a rent or anything, so we exchanged. That you could do. So he went to that apartment, we came in his house. That’s where I got my second child that time.
  </p>
  <p id="813">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="814">
   A: Mm-hm.

  </p>
  <p id="818">
   A: No. I had nobody an-any more, no.
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   Q: And Joe didn’t want to stay either?
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   A: No, he couldn’t get along very much with his father.
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   Q: He couldn't get along with his father?
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   A: No, no, he was not nice. And then we left. And I think 17 later -- 17 years later, we went back to Holland, and I told him, see your parents and he didn’t want to. Says, do it for your mother, your mother, she always worked hard and she was good. So we went and then he was so happy, the father now.
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   Q: The father was different.
  </p>
  <p id="824">

  </p>
  <p id="827">
   Q: Really?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="835">
   Q: And was then a difficult time between 1945 and 1953 for you there?
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   A: No [indecipherable] not. No. We had friends, Joe played soccer. I made a lot of friends there. No, we had pretty good.
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   Q: So life was -- was not so bad.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   A: But was hard financial. He didn’t make that much. And then with the kids and all.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
