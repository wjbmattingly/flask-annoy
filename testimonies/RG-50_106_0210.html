  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: Yes, yes when I saw the motorcycles driving in, three people were, three sold, three Germans with the uniforms with the bullets, that frightened me. Then there was a line for bread every morning. This is a heavy story. And my mother sent me to the line to wait til she comes out. When I was standing in the line and a German soldier was coming and checking the line. Who, who is Juden, who is Jewish and kicking out of the line. But my, as a child I didn’t look like Jewish or not Jewish. They didn’t kick me out but they kicked out another little boy that didn’t, that looked Jewish and wasn’t. And he was screaming I am not Juden. And they still kicked him out. I got frightened and I told the man behind me that was standing a beautiful gray haired man with glasses and he told me he is a Doctor Dolinsky and tell your mother that my line is with in front of him. If I go back to my mother because I got frightened of the German soldiers. So I ran back to my mother and I was almost hysterical. I can’t stay there because I’m afraid of the being kicked out from the German soldier. So she came back and she met this Doctor Dolinsky. He is a person that saved our life because he said today is my last day in the line for bread. I am going to cross the border. To the Russian side. So my mother got very, very happy and she said I wish I can do that but we were poor. We had no money. So he said I’m going to tell the farmer that takes me across, that you have no money but he should take whatever you have in the house. And you know my mother didn’t believe it’s going to happen. And next morning 6:00 the farmer did call on the door and he told me that Doctor Dolinsky sent me. I took him on the other side of the border. Was a neutral border between Poland and Russia that was open, supposed to be open 12 or 14 days. So she, the farmer knocked on the door and he says yes, I know you have no money. So he took what we had, a sewing machine and a customer’s fur coat that was hanging behind a screen. That’s all he was able to take. And put us in the wagon, the four of us. Covered us with hay and took us to the neutral zone.

So my mother stepped in with her strong personality. She spoke a perfect Russian. And she says you better kill us right here before you send us back. So he says if you feel that, that strong I’m going to let you sleep over at the farmer’s house again. We slept in the farmer’s house on the neutral border. And the only thing I remember was he was give us, gave us to eat because we were starving. White bread with ham. Ham, salt ham, not bacon. Kind of a slice of ham. The taste I have still today. It’s amazing how strong taste could be. And my mother wouldn’t touch it. Course not. So next morning we were going back to the border.

But this place had a lot of prisoners from Germany and Japanese. Where my brother had them in the coal mine. So what an experience he had. He was telling us stories that they were dying from hunger and work. Even the horses were blind. I didn’t know that the horses worked too much in the dark, they get blind.

And then they made a meeting for us, the four children. The four that they know to be Jewish. Don’t date anybody here because anybody here you’re never going to get out federally. Because these are people that lost their citizenship. That part of the city. It was terrible. There were soldiers. You know https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 you’re, in the history was, it’s a long history of Russian army. I don’t remember the general. He took the 600 people to the German side. He thought that Germany is going to win. So they become and when the Russians took them over they become prisoners of the country, like enemies. And no passports, no, no legal citizenship.

  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: Oh you had a radio.
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: Yes. And I had a neighbor that a Russian soldier that lost a leg. And he was a friend of my brother. So he always used to come over to take me walking and I didn’t know he lost a leg because he came, he went with me to my school dance. And he pretended to be able to dance. And then he, one day he asked me to come to his place. That was, he was living with his sister and the family. And he was a young boy, maybe 17 or 18. So he was crying and he was, he had a bottle of vodka on the table and he told me I have to tell you my story. He was a pilot. I didn’t even know. Well he was too young to be a pilot and he lost a leg. So I said so but you lived that. The artificial leg was standing in the corner. You know I was so young. I, I ran out. I was crying. I couldn’t handle it. So anyway, so this was Boris, my brother’s friend.

  <p id="154">
   Q: Did you have any identification papers at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: No documents but she, my mother kept the Polish documents somehow. She said we’re going to get out of Siberia with these papers because we were not prisoners like many other Jewish people were taken to Siberia, but we went ourselves. We asked to be sent because of my brother. Being there. So it’s one coincidence helped us.
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: Did you talk about your situation with the other Jewish children? https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: No, I couldn’t explain to the other children because they were not from Poland. So they were Jewish children from the Russian atmosphere. Surrounding so there was nothing to explain to them. They knew about the war and about the bombing and they were worried that Hitler shouldn’t win. And we had these discussions in school.
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: I was going to say did you talk about the war?
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: In the school, in the school the teachers were, was telling us how is it going. Who is winning and even when Stalingrad was the biggest end of the war, we were talk, we were told about it. If Stalingrad they win, then the war is finished. So it was shocking to take it. Nobody thanks to my mother’s brain. She knew everything. We used to call her Golda Meir because she was very intelligent, very super smart.
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   Q: Any religious practice during this time?
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: No, no. We never practiced at home either. She was non-religious. Even she was raised from an ultra-orthodox family but her mother died after birth. And they were twins. Her brother and her were sent to different orphanages so she didn’t have any background of religion But she had a brain and the book. All the time with a book. This is the most important thing in my life, too, books.

  <p id="165">
   A: Yes. They considered it serious problem, the doctors and they didn’t strain me with the, with exams. They were so good to me. They let me go to all that, because I was normally maybe a good student without it.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: That was, these were the Russian teachers.
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: The Russian.
  </p>
  <p id="168">

  </p>
  <p id="170">

  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: That was amazing. The first thing they asked us, where we want to go. So we said back to Poland.

  </p>
  <p id="179">
   A: No, not that time. We didn’t have any papers. I don’t know where — there are many things in my mind, it’s like erased. I don’t know why because usually I have a good memory.
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: So then they asked you where you wanted to go and you say —
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   A: Where do we want to go.
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: And you say Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: So we said Poland but they put on Eshelon, Eshelon is the train. It was a wagon train that they make comfortable. One wagon was for the food. One wagon for the people. Or a few, and even one wagon for people that were artistic. They organized music for, for this train for three months. And we start two weeks. It was a schlep. A long schlep. And a lot of Jewish people on the way were picked up.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: Did you get off the train?
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: No, we don’t go out. You go back to sleep on the train. On the benches.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: You stay on the train.
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: Yeah but the train stops and the farmers bring with the basket whatever they have to sell you and we didn’t have anything to sell so whatever the train has for us, we had to, we got some kind of a food, I don’t know what. I don’t remember what we were eating. It’s like breaking out. Anyways, but each train oh and the worst thing I meant to tell you. How we survived going to Russia. During the bombing, my father and my brother went to look for food. Because everything was open. The stores, nobody was there to take care of there, they were afraid of the bombs. So they brought back a sack of tobacco and one sack of rice. They carried on their shoulders. And that kept us going to go to Russia. Can you imagine. And each, every time that we needed some https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 bread a little tobacco we were able to get in Russia, a piece of bread. So this was very important things that my father and brother did. Anyways, it’s nice to talk about it and it’s nice to forget a lot.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: You’re leaving Russia going towards Poland and you’re on the train.
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: Months it took us to go back. We stopped in Germany. We didn’t go to — we went through Poland and my brother decided to marry one of the girls on the train. Yeah and she was Polish and Polish the family, they were coming from Siberia too. The father was killed because they refused, he refused to work for the Russians. He was an architect. And mother with the two daughters, which Kristina was my sister in law. And they stayed behind in Poland. The two of them got married and lived in Poland because he needed to go back to university to get his engineering degree.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: How did your parents feel about that?
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: My parents had nothing to say. My brother was a very strong minded person. And this Polish girl was innocent girl. She went through the whole, the war too. And this is the, I was with her and her mother. The only thing when they left Poland, they stayed in Poland. And he went to university. And that was a hard time. We end up ourselves straight to Germany. To the DP camp. Because you know DP camp we didn’t know where we want to go. We were not Zionistically minded. We didn’t want to go to Israel because my mother’s logic, we had enough war. We don’t want to be in a war zone. That made sense to me too. Anyway, that’s I’m sure many people feel that way. But they were mostly young people were very patriotic singing all the Hebrew songs which I didn’t ever learn. Would be nice to know.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: So you got off at a DP camp.
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: DP camp I lived for two years.

  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: Where was that near?
  </p>
  <p id="197">
   A: That was about 200 kilometers from Kassel. I don’t know how far was Kassel because Kassel, when I got married I gave birth to my daughter. We lived in that DP camp. We did not appreciate all the beautiful food that the Jewish community was giving us because we didn’t know what it was. Coffee in containers or sardines. You know everything was strange to us. And you know you take it for granted, but they did a lot. Wonderful.
  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: What did you do in the DP camp?
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: I went to courses. I took designing, because nothing is long enough to finish anything. All my life I didn’t have enough time to finish.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: You’re about 17 years old now.
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: Yes. I wanted to be a designer, a good designer because of my father’s sewing, I had a lot of knowledge in sewing. And then it was a nice group of young people. Some took dentistry. Some took engineering just to start with but we didn’t have time to finish, because we had to get, plan the future. Where to go. They had a theater organizer with a lot of actors. Once a week they put on a show for us. And it was strange, the feeling because we are, we don’t know where you want to be.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: And these were all young Jewish people that you —
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Young Jewish people. My husband I met, refused to move out from the camp, because most of the couples that got married moved out to the village to live a better life. But he was very Jewish and he decided no, I’m not going to live in a German atmosphere. We have to live. So it https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 was a horrible experience for me to live in the camp. In one room with my mother, father and a husband.
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: When did you get married?
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: In 1948.

  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: So you got married and —
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: We got married, lived in the same room with mother and father. Was a disaster for me. And the whole idea of sex was a disaster. I was 19 years old, but physically not developed. And physically because under nourished and most of the time. And you know it was disappointing because he was very powerful person and I had to be able to live with that. It was not good. So after my daughter was born, I decided no more children. No, because —
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: Did you give birth in a hospital? https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="215">

  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: To a hospital?
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: To the hospital yeah. It was by train I suppose I went because there was no other way. I didn’t tell my mother. I didn’t tell my husband because I was very upset, very angry at life. I didn’t want that. I mean I thought this was marriage and having a child should be a pleasure. For me, it wasn’t. So that was it. But to me it was part of the war. I am still in the war zone. And so it’s bad.
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: It’s understandable. You had a daughter you said.
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: [had a beautiful girl and he was very upset because he wanted a kaddish. I said you know if you, if you talk to her about it maybe she can tell, sing kaddish for you. No, it made sense. What’s the difference? A girl should be as close. They were never close.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: And her name?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Her name is, at that time he wanted after his mother Bella, but we changed it to Beverly. She is a professional person. She has a PhD psychology. She is a beautiful person. With a very strong personality like him.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: You and the baby go back to the DP camp. And —
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Yes and we waiting for a result, where to go and he was from fur family at home. They had, one of the brothers I think had a fur business. So he decided that fur would be better Canada. So we going to go to Canada instead of United States. He applied for Canada. And we got the passage to go to Canada, slow. You know by boat. To Halifax. Very, everybody was that sick. To my luck I wasn’t so I was able to walk around and feed my baby and tell the cook that didn’t speak any other language but Greek. What I need for my baby so I had to look myself in the https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 closet because everybody was dead sick. It was very bad timing. I don’t remember what month. It must have been September. It was a disaster the trip for people.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Was it 1948 or something like that.
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: 1948 yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="226">

   A: We settled right away in Montreal. Well actually it’s the best time of my life.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: You stayed in Montreal for how long?
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: Oh many years. I am only in Toronto 20 years so she was raised, my daughter went to university. Everything possible I gave her. She took it because she was very lucky with her, very intelligent girl. She was a good student and I had no problems. Without the language, without helping her. Because I couldn’t help her in high school or university like other mothers can
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: And then you picked up English, right?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: I picked up English yes, But not good enough. You know I had two courses. I should have taken much more.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Did you work at all?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: I did yeah. I did work. At the fur business. I went with him to the fashion shows, to the buying and selling and then I had another job outside too. Anyways, work was a pleasure for me.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: When did you move to Toronto? https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: I moved only 20 years ago. Because my daughter is here much longer.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: And your husband, is he still alive?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: My husband, no he died very young, at 54. From cancer. And frightening he had it was considered to be Hodgkin’s but it wasn’t Hodgkin’s. It’s a malignant glands all over the body. And that time was frightening for me because my daughter developed a titus gland situation. The tonsils were not removed and by not removing the tonsils which one doctor recommended, keep it because she is going to need it when she is older. Was a mistake. She developed the serious disease and at 17 they had to remove them and put her on a cortisone for six months. So you have to listen to two doctors. That’s why.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: Can we talk a little bit before we close about your thoughts and your feelings, how your childhood, your experiences affected you. Do you think you’d be a different person today than if you had not gone through what you went through?
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: Yes, I would be, Iam very compassionate and too soft to people sometimes. So I have to pretend that I am wrong. I have compassion when I should have more, I should help more people than I do. I would like, I wanted to adopt children but my husband, no, never, I never going to love somebody else’s child. And one of my friends was dying and I had a little boy for six months with me and I wanted to keep him and he refused. That was a big mistake. I, you know, I didn’t got from life what I wanted. A place, education, I’m missing that. Yes, these families think no matter how much I try to educate myself, I still miss the knowledge.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: What are your interests today? Do you do —

  </p>
  <p id="245">
   A: I do. I socialize in a Yiddish group conversation.
  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: So now you speak Yiddish.
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: I speak perfectly Yiddish. That’s why I spoke to Herman in Yiddish and I joined this group of Yiddish educated people and I felt I educate myself by listening to them. But the problem is they fell apart and my favorite guy 1s blind now and actually Mr. Taub knows him. Because they were ahead with eight years, ten years ahead of me. They had the opportunity to educate themselves when I didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: Your husband’s name was?
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: He called himself Zalman with a zed. But according to the documents it’s Solomon. He came from a very good family from Wreblewska. They had a large trees for building, cutting and shipping through the war. That was their family business. But the horror story. I have of them. His father that he brought, I have about, before he was killed. They were underground for 17 people underground working and somebody reported them to the Germans. They threw in a bomb into the underground so this, the story I have from his leadership, between the 17 people. That was a horror story. But I’m sure you know many horror stories.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Are there any sights or noises or smells today that remind you of your war time experience?
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: No, no. Only the pictures if I see the bombing of Poland and fire all over cause my father took me by the hand to see it, to run from one uncle to another to see who is alive. If nobody was hurt. During the bombing before Hitler walked in. The bombing was more frightening for me with the fire all around. https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 Running from one place to another, nowhere to hide. And then visiting his sister with seven children hiding in a little place. And the orthodox brother refused to see a doctor and the little boy of 14 had to have an appendicitis. He said no god would help. No, he died at home because I didn’t know if this was money problem or because he was ultra-orthodox. It could be both. Now this horror story from that family.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: Do you think about your experiences now? Do you think about them a lot?
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: I try not to but it comes back. Whenever a situation if I talk to other people, I see oh I realize similar situation to what I had. I know some of my people went to concentration camp, and they don’t talk about it. They don’t want to talk about it.
  </p>
  <p id="254">

  </p>
  <p id="258">
   Q: Are you a Canadian citizen now?
  </p>
  <p id="259">
   A: Canadian yeah right away. I am proud of being Canadian. My best time in my life I had in Montreal because I met nice people that helped me even without the language. She introduced me to swimming and skiing and that was 40 years of her life. She was doing for me.
  </p>

   Q: You play the piano.
  </p>
  <p id="265">
   A: Yeah, the piano classical but now I’m taking a senior group. They are teaching a little more than classical because we want to play pieces without being so serious. So it’s a nice group, Yamaha school of music and they have a senior group.

  <p id="268">

  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: You know she has a little biography from me and she knows a lot but she doesn’t want to talk about it. Like today yesterday I was visiting my niece. That was my, from my brother, from the Polish wife. And she is more interested in my daughter in that. No, because she doesn’t know that much.
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   Q: Does your daughter have children?
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: Oh yeah she has two daughters.
  </p>
  <p id="272">
   Q: Do they ask you about your experience?
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   A: No, they’re children. They are not interested at all. I don’t talk about it. I think Hannah the younger one would be. I think my daughter is too hard person to discuss it. Leave it alone she says. And I don’t think she’s right. https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="274">

  </p>
  <p id="275">
   A: I didn’t get til now. I was applying and they sent a horrible letter I got from Germany. There was no reason for me to leave from Poland. Can you imagine a letter like that. When I showed it to the lawyer here, but now they asking we should reapply. So I reapplied and they sent from Australia 5000 dollars. Ok the lawyer took up 3200. Can you imagine? Then actually this layer that I have now, Mr. Shapiro was very upset. He sent another letter to them. How dare you charge for that, for the compensation. So they sent me another 3000 dollars. That was the whole compensation. No I didn’t got monthly like other people did because many people, I know some people that didn’t tell the truth. And I am a straightforward person. I don’t want to, I never lied in my life.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   Q: What are your thoughts about Israel?
  </p>
  <p id="277">
   A: The country 1s ok if you’re very patriotic, Zionistic. They are harsh people. They destroyed the Jewish language. Because they feel we are beneath them and this I resent about Israel.
  </p>
  <p id="278">
   Q: You mean, are you talking about Yiddish.
  </p>
  <p id="279">
   A: Yiddish yeah. They built it up, they built up their own language to this and I have a big article. I wish, maybe I still have it. That was a mistake. Right when the country became a country, should have been taught equal Yiddish and Hebrew, but no to them Yiddish is only European Jews are speaking Yiddish. And Hasidim, some of them. Sections. So I resent that about Israel but they are apologizing now. They keep saying they’re teaching the children Yiddish now. I said no you’re teaching the children Yiddish now but you neglected it so many years. It’s going to disappear with us. But Herman told things it’s growing better, the Yiddish. I don’t know if maybe he’s right. The university they teach and Yiddish 1s only strictly for the European Jews.

  </p>
  <p id="281">
   A: Never, they never learned the lessons. Because there, everybody was closed for us. The worst thing that England didn’t do anything. Canada didn’t do anything. The boats were sent back. It was shocking, absolutely shocking.
  </p>
  <p id="282">
   Q: Today do you think people have learned the lessons?
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   A: I don’t think so. Because if you see around the world it’s happening different nations. There is so much discrimination even now. Jewish or other nationalities and I don’t know if you knew in the states about this artist’s reminder of the ugly times. He built a lot of buildings all over Canada. Lieber, I can see it, I can see his name. I have it right in front of me, Liberhart, Liberstrom. And he’s an art. Daniel.
  </p>
  <p id="284">
   Q: Liebeskind.
  </p>
  <p id="285">
   A: You heard about him. Reminder of ugly times. But he made a lot of, he 1s very much against English politics way back. England and Roosevelt they didn’t do anything. It’s absolutely horrible.
  </p>
  <p id="286">
   Q: Are you comfortable among other survivors? Do you prefer to be with other survivors?
  </p>
  <p id="287">
   A: Not necessarily because I don’t, I’m more comfortable with the survivors than the born Canadians that don’t know anything what’s happening. But are ignorant at the, and I find that they don’t know. Only my friends that lived in Montreal that belonged to Jewish communities, they know a little bit. But they don’t know the history of Europe. She tells me, one of my friends, I don’t want to know about it. So it means you cannot communicate. You communicate better with the survivors. You have a better conversation, understanding I would say.
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   Q: Do you have any desire to go back to Poland? https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   A: No. it’s amazing. My daughter wants to go to see where I went to school, the park. If the street doesn’t exist. And I really felt that why should we waste money in Poland. So I said to her it doesn’t make sense. You want to take me on a trip, we’ll go somewhere else. That’s it. Maybe I made a mistake. At 80, was the right time. Now I’m 85. No, most of my friends went back.
  </p>
  <p id="290">
   Q: Did go back?
  </p>
  <p id="291">
   A: And they are disappointed. Some of the Polish people feel why are you coming back to get back your houses. It’s horrible. Horrible. Yeah you must have read about Felix Zeidman. His story 1s unbelievable. And he was full of hate all those years. Until at the end he forgive the Polish family helped him to survive. He made honors, he honored them, took them to Israel. So you read the whole story?
  </p>
  <p id="292">
   Q: Iam familiar with his story.
  </p>
  <p id="293">
   A: It’s an unbelievable story. Listen the stories of life are beautiful but you don’t have to live with it. To live with it, you get depressed. You know you get down. And I am a very easy person to get depressed. So I have to be careful. I am going very often into a depression.
  </p>
  <p id="294">
   Q: Do you get any professional help?
  </p>
  <p id="295">
   A: No, no, no.
  </p>
  <p id="296">
   Q: You just handle it yourself
  </p>
  <p id="297">
   A: Ihave to pull it out myself. I look around. I see other people have worse and I am still the lucky one so that’s why I figure it out. So when I told my daughter, you are depressed. No, no, no you don’t tranquilizer for that. No, no, no. you have to do it yourself. Physical exercise. I do a lot of yoga. I’m a physical person. Maybe that’s why I survived.
  </p>
  <p id="298">
   Q: Where is your brother? https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="299">
   A: Oh he died. Five years ago. My best picture is with him. Such a strong life, a love for me, unbelievable.
  </p>
  <p id="300">
   Q: Did he come to Canada too?
  </p>
  <p id="301">
   A: Yeah, yeah he was living in Canada but he was living in Montreal for a while. And he never succeeded here because he didn’t have a diploma from here. So he had to work as a draughtsman instead of engineer. And but in Poland, we were supporting him. I was supporting him for 15, 20 dollars a month. That was enough for him to survive. But then when he came to Canada he had a struggle. Because she was not able to help. I can get any type of job, whatever I wanted. I was able to get. And some people cannot help. So I am too helpful sometimes. And then I go into this depression. Not long. Anyways. I hope you are not tired of talking to me.
  </p>
  <p id="302">
   Q: No, I’m very grateful to you. Is there anything you would like to add before we close? Any thoughts that you have or message to your grandchildren or anything you wanted to say?
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   A: They think I succeeded in life more than other people with education. So at my 80" birthday that’s what they told me. Even my daughter said. What you have I don’t have with a PhD.
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   Q: The knowledge about life.
  </p>
  <p id="305">
   A: The knowledge about life. Yeah but you know you’re never happy with anything when you go through this war. You’re really not happy person, no. You make the best of every situation but you’re not a happy person. But you have to analyze that you could be worse. And you’re lucky what you have. Anyways, I always feel I didn’t do enough for other people.
  </p>
  <p id="306">
   Q: You’re talking about during the war or —
  </p>
  <p id="307">
   A: No, no, no after the war. After the war. I could have done much more but my late husband would stop me all the time. If I wanted to go to university, he did not approve of it. You’re going https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 to be away too much. But when he died, I did go. I took five courses in one year and I got so sick and tired physically. I overdid it. So I took two years at university and I didn’t continue. I put too much pressure on myself. That’s a pressure person. And that’s enough. Now I have to make the best of everything. To see anybody that survived like me because most of the people I see depressed and going into dementia and it’s frightening. I still drive.
  </p>
  <p id="308">
   Q: Do you?
  </p>
  <p id="309">
   A: Oh yes, to me the best pleasure is when I drive on my own and I listen to classical music, yes. This is very important. That’s why I came to Washington by car.
  </p>
  <p id="310">
   Q: What are your thoughts about the Holocaust Museum in Washington?
  </p>
  <p id="311">
   A: It’s absolutely beautiful. Except til I saw the fire in Poland. I cannot look at them you know. Actually the tragedy, the uniforms the shoes. I had to avoid looking at that. Because that’s like a pain in the chest. How people survived many of them. But Hitler it’s a shock how people could be cruel, but it’s happening all over again in different countries. So how can we change the world? I like to see it change. Like the orthodox do believe the messiah. Where is he? I like to believe in it. Anyways, theater would be good for you to relax your brain. They’re playing a lot of plays here, Yiddish plays in my area. And the reading a lot, that helps.
  </p>
  <p id="312">
   Q: How old are your grandchildren?
  </p>
  <p id="313">
   A: My granddaughter, the older one is 28, going to be and the younger one 22. The 22 is not settled. She’s finishing her last year university. She doesn’t taking psychology. She 1s taking philosophy. I says where you going to go with that. She would like to get the same degree that her mother has but it’s not necessary. Not everybody has the same capability. So she has to decide this year. She’s undecided girl, but the most adorable person. The older one is graduated from university in social work. Actually she’s working for the government for seeing the mistakes university are doing. If they need help they call the office where she works to reorganize it. That’s a good job for her. But not, she went to private school so she has an easier https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013 time to face life than the younger one. So my daughter made a mistake with the younger one, not sending her to private school for four years. Because the preparation 1s easier. You are prepared for university pressure. And when you don’t have the push you cannot take the pressure. The younger one couldn’t take the pressure so she had to stretch from four years to five which is ok. But still they are wonderful children. Can’t complain.
  </p>
  <p id="314">
   Q: That’s a nice note to end on.
  </p>
  <p id="315">
   A: That you have only good children.
  </p>
  <p id="316">
   Q: Anything else you wanted to add before we close.
  </p>
  <p id="317">
   A: No. No, because you know there are so many things on the mind that come and go. And you cannot remember everything, but whatever I remember it’s very hard to face for other people. When I hear somebody say starving, I’m starving. I say please don’t use that word starving. Because they don’t know the meaning of it. Starving, not to see a piece of bread for four years, not to see a tomato. Not to see altogether, I didn’t have anything. For four years. How I survived, I’m still here, I must have been very, very strong person, even being a celiac. Anyway, because people think they don’t eat on time. I’m starving, I have to go to a restaurant to eat. Absolutely not. Control your brain. Take a glass of water before you starve so you don’t starve. I don’t like that word starving. Because nobody knows the meaning unless you do it. Anyways I talk too much. That’s my problem. I do, I do. I’m very outspoken and one of my friends, I just had a Canadian girl with a pace maker, she gets depressed because she is doing a lot of work, amazing woman. But she is absent minded person. And she calls me up to relax. So she said after I talk to you we, cause she cannot get used to the pace maker. And she not a week, not a day it’s going to take months. And she wants to go back to dancing now. I said you can do it but be careful. So she fell and I’m trying to help her but there 1s a limit how much I can do. You have to do it yourself. Right. Maybe I am too logical. Really. Nobody can analyze me. Only yourself, you have to analyze. We have to just try and make the best and not to be depressed. I do go into the depression. I can cry easy. Is that better? I am just listening if I cry easy. Very easy. Something on television that reminds me of Europe, I can cry. Yeah, of course. https://collections.ushmm.org August 12, 2013
