  <p id="14">
   A: So I—I was in a coma, I don’t know, a day, two days, three days, a week, two weeks, I have no idea. I only remember I got up one day from the coma, and two November 30, 2014 girls are sitting in the sides of my bed, two German girls. Nurses, I understand. And they taking out the — the — the — the — the lice from my body. I was full with lice. And th-th-they died in the — they didn’t have what to eat, so they went in-in the — in the — in the skin, and they — A2: They digged in. They dig. Digged in —
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   A: And the died, and I couldn’t — I couldn’t take them out. They were in the back, and they were in the legs, and they — unbelievable. They were working eight hours, and every hour another two, and — until they took it off. And the next day comes the Dr. Gottlieb. He was a Jewish doctor from England. He said to me in Yiddish, I must kick you out, I’m sorry. You are not sick, you’re only weak. You didn’t had what to eat. But you must go out, I need the bed for a sick person. And they kicked me out. I come to the door, there is sitting a English two or three soldiers, officers, I —I don’t know myself, I wasn’t — I wasn’t hundred percent.

  <p id="32">
   Q: Yes.

I had not — I have not seen such a food til Bergen-Belsen, and since Bergen-Belsen. Unbelievable. And I was eating, and I was young, and a healthy man. You can see I’m today 93, nobody believes me. If I go up in the bus and I don’t pay the ticket because you don’t have to pay after 65, you’re already 65? Can you show me papers? I’m a show him papers. Because I jump up on the floor — on — on the car like nothing. Some few weeks later, I find out that they give in Bucharest 130,000 lai(ph) every — every DP, displaced person.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: Every DP gets 130,000 lai(ph).

   A: — but I have the title — the title. I was 16 years old and I got a title. It was a sensation in — in — 1n the city, in Munkacs. Don’t know if you heard from Munkacs, a very famous Hassidic city, the number one city in the world before the war. Hassidic city. So, I-I-I told them ’22, and he wrote ’23. I don’t know, possible I said it wrong. I don’t blame him, but I didn’t care. I was thinking I come home, I will go in in the city hall, and Pll take my same birthday and I will have my own original birthday, and I'll be changed. I came home, and there was no city hall. Burned everything, the Russians burned everything. I had to wait two, three days, I don’t want — didn’t want it to wait. I take the car and went back to Budapest. But on — anyway, after a few weeks, possibly a few months, I don’t remember really, I heard that they give hundred thousand — 130,000 dollars for every DP, I will go there and get it. But I didn’t meant what so much for the money, because I told you I straightaway — you know what 500 dollars was a month? I got salary 500 dollars a month.

So, I — I — you — they announced me — oh, I did a wedding, a very rich wedding, Moses. He was the head of the Haaretz paper.

But Yigael Yarden called me, and asked me — yeah, I will tell you, I have two papers on the pable — table, to sign that you are free from the army, and the other to sign do you want to be another two years. And I beg you to be — sign for the other two years, because you don’t know what it means when you make a funeral, and the mother, or th-the wife from the young man comes up to me and says to me, I couldn’t find comfort til I heard the cantor [indecipherable].

  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: Which stories? A2: Quite a few. There’s the story going to ba — to — to Syria via — the trip with [indecipherable]. On the trip that we went to with the Boyovich(ph) in the car, what happened — oh, this is —
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   A: Oh [indecipherable] A2: Absolutely — absolute — this is one. When — the story when he went —
  </p>
  <p id="211">

  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: Oh we — okay. November 30, 2014 A2: Yeah. Well —
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: While you were living in Antwerp? A2: While we were living in Antwerp, okay. Fili — first of all, he gave concerts all over Europe. I mean, we were in — in Manchester, England, London —
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: Europe, South America, and America — A2: Moshe, please. If I talk, let me talk. We’re not jumping to South America, I’m talking about Europe now. Moshe likes to —
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: It’s okay, it’s okay. A2: Yeah, okay. I said, Manchester, London, li — Liverpool, Glasgow — oh, Glasgow we have a story. I— I must tell a story with Glasgow because it’s — remember Mendelson, the story? Okay, I’Il come back. And, of course Amsterdam, Paris, everywhere, he gave concert. So, once we were invited to go to Zurich, Moshe was supposed to give a concert in Zurich, and wi — wanted — and when we lived in Europe, in Europe you used the train then, cause it’s a convenient.
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   Q: Right, yeah. A2: So, a friend of ours, a Mr. Boyovich(ph) came and said, I heard you’re going to Zurich. I happen to go the same week to Basel because I have a sister there, and then I’m going to Zurich, so I can take you. So we thought it’s a good idea, because November 30, 2014 he told us that go — traveling to Switzerland, you have to go through Luxembourg and — and France, and we haven’t been there yet. So we said fine, we’ll go with you. And we went. We — til we came to si— to Canada, we traveled everywhere in ti— on the Israeli passport, okay? So when you come to Luxembourg, then with the custom, that when you arrive on the border, the people from the — you know, they’re sitting in the hut, in a ho — little house? They come to the car, they take your passport, they check, they did what they do, and they bring it back, and goodbye. So about five minutes — am I too fast? No. About five minutes later, they bring back the passport for — to — to the couple that are friends, and not our passport. And we sit, and we sit, I don’t know, maybe it was only five minutes, but to us it looked like half an hour [indecipherable] we didn’t know what’s going on. And we thought also that friend of ours, what were they saying? Maybe they are saying we are smuggling diamonds or something, because why don’t they come back with the passport? Eventually — yeah, eventually somebody comes, one, walks around the car, looks in it as we were the back, looks, goes back. Another one comes, same thing, and a third worker. We didn’t know what’s going on, because eventually this one comes and gives us the passport to say thank you, you can go. Well, she said wait — wait a second. What happened here? Why did it — what happened? Why did they come — it was in 1956, and this was when the Suez War was. And this is when November 30, 2014 the Suez War was. And this is when Israel was the first time on the map aft — you know, big, big because of — and they knew. And the first time in the life, they saw —
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Saw Israeli — A2: — Israeli passports. So they wanted to see how Israeli looked like. And this 1s the one story. Okay, now we continue. When we came to France — til today I don’t know where it was, a small city.
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Twas in the night. A2: Yeah, it was night, and it was pouring rain, we couldn’t see in front of us.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   A: Raining [indecipherable] A2: Okay. So we decided to stop and stay the night, and we’ll continue the next day. We stayed — we went to the hotel, and a — we took, of course, a room, and our friends were — took a room, and Moshe said he is going to take a shower first. So while he was in the shower, there’s a knock on the door. Knock at the door, I open the door and I see three men, all dressed in black suits, very, very — and very serious. And —
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: May I stop you? A2: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   A: If l—1f I get to say I had to get — A2: I didn’t forget — I didn’t forget the passport. November 30, 2014

  <p id="230">
   A: Mr. Kraus, Prime Minister. A2: No Moshe, let me, please. It’s true —
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: But it was my title, prime minister. November 30, 2014 A2: ?m—I’m coming to it, but you’re spoiling it. You’re spoiling the whole story. When we came in the hotel, okay, then was the customs also, you have to give a passport. And when you leave —
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Yeah. A2: — they give it back to you.
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   Q: Yeah. A2: Okay. I didn’t remember what’s written in the passport. And again, as Moshe mentioned to you, he was the chief cantor of the city, and — and our passport was written all in French. So in French his title —
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   A: I was city cantor. A2: Yes, you said that already Moshe. It was written, where they say the title, prime minister of [indecipherable]. This was his title. In French it me — you know, in Europe, a cantor and a rabbi is a minister, like in England, you know, so he was a minister premier, chief minister.
  </p>

They got billions of diamonds. But outside he succeeded to build up a little shop in a little [indecipherable] to live. And he began to sell the — wh-what the b-bl-black meat. And they all could buy, they buy cash. Bad checks, well, who knows from check? And he used to take the money and count and put it in bags, November 30, 2014 quarter million.

The next day — from Johannesburg you couldn’t take out the rand, not one rand you couldn’t take out. You were not allowed. Only all — all — all the money had to me from — from — from all the world, were pounds, dollars, gudens(ph), kronen, the — not rand. Rand was holy for South Africa.

  <p id="407">
   Q: Take the — take it out of the country. A2: Yeah.

The first one, we stayed in a hotel, and there was no western people there. The only people who stayed in this hotel was so dark from — from iddel — Middle East Arabs, I don’t know, a-and Russians. And we were the only ones [indecipherable] of course, Israeli passport. So one day, the desk calls us and they said, there’s a man come to see you. We didn’t know it — who it is. To make the story short, there was a man in — in — his name is Singer. Actually, he was an opera singer. And he remembered Moshe, they went to chayder together at home [indecipherable] November 30, 2014 together. When he heard the name, he knew who itt is. So he came to see us. At that time a local person couldn’t come into hotel, the hotel was only for international visitors. You couldn’t walk in. And if you walked in, you had to leave his passport at the desk, and they had to check what it is, and report to the [indecipherable] and then he came to see — then he 1s allowed to come and see us. And of course that was emotional to — Moshe didn’t remember — you remembered him? You did remember? Anyhow — okay. And then he tells us a story like this, which is unbelievable story. He says he is married, he has four children, one son, one daughter and twin — twin girls. And he remained a Jew. He was also in the camp and survived, but he is still a Jew, in heart. And he knows that if he’Il stay with the chil — with the family in — in Prague, they will lose the children. They’ll become goyim. They will intermarry, because the Jewish life wasn’t as interested — as organized. I don’t know if they had the chief rabbi there — they did — yeah, they did have a chief rabbi. And — and their son is already 18, and he’s already a member of the youth — they were poor — poor gi — poor — poor communists, of course, [indecipherable] communists, and he’s afraid he will lose them.
  </p>
  <p id="586">
   A: He lent me the money to buy this picture. A2: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="587">
   A: The chief rabbi. November 30, 2014 A2: Oh, there wa — this 1s the — the shul in Prague, the Altneuschul in Prague.
  </p>
  <p id="588">
   Q: Okay. Yeah. A2: The famous Altneuschul. [indecipherable] later.
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   Q: That’s where the — that’s where the golem is. A2: Right, right, right, P1l tell you the story about this, Pll quickly tell it. Okay, so — so what —
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   Q: Did you see — did you see the golem? A2: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So — so —
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   A: I saw myself. A2: Yeah. So —
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   A: So I see the golem, because the — there was a — A2: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   A: — there was a mirror. I had — I told them I want to see the golem, go up and [indecipherable] is a mirror — A2: No, he said —
  </p>
  <p id="594">
   A: — you will see him. A2: No, he said — he told us that American when they come, they want to see the golem.
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. November 30, 2014 A2: So yeah, sure, you can see him, but it cost five dollars —
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. A2:—to go up. And then they started going — okay, so — so what do you want from us, children. Listen to this, I mean it sounds unbelievable, he said, I want you to take the children out. I leave them in — them in your hand, and you only have to promise me one thing, that you give — give them the best Jewish education, they should remain Jews, that’s all I want. Can you believe?
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   Q: Wow. A2: I mean, if — really, I mean, I — we have proof, because it stil — but otherwise people won’t believe a story like this, right?
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   Q: And? A2: And wait. So Moshe said, I can’t promise you anything at the moment. [Il tra — I'll see what I can do, and we’ll see. And — and wait. We didn’t leave yet, there’s another story. For when we were in Prague, Moshe got a call from Rabbi Rosen, chief rabbi from Bucharest.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   Q: Of course. And chief rabbi of Romania. A2: He has to go — yeah, yeah, he has to go back for this mission, for whatever, you know. So he gave me my — my passport, he gave me some money, and he left. Sh- November 30, 2014 Shall I tell the story what happened to me? It’s not important. I don’t have to, but it’s remarkable, but I don’t know — okay, I —
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   A: Right, you — you are the boss. A2: —no — yeah — no, I won’t tell, I won’t tell. I just tell the sh-short. So Moshe left, and I remained in pra — in Prague alone. It was very unpleasant, it — to be 1n the hotel, it was all those Arabs, a woman alone, and they looked at me all the time, you know. This is not important. But this Mr. Singer, he was my connection. He is the only one I knew. And as it happened, it — ish — sho — told me where to go, to the opera, and the ballet and all that. So then, we had an agreement, he didn’t know how long he’Il be in — in Bucharest, so — and I remained a week in Prague, because this was my passport, I couldn’t leave [indecipherable] or something. So we had — we stayed from there — at — at — in the meantime we were in Russia, but we told you about Russia. You forgot one story in Russia. Was the man who came to told you — tell you that he’s grandson of this — that he sang this song for you, the Yiddish song.
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   Q: That’s there. A2: It’s there? Okay, so we’ll skip it. Okay. So — so I left at the airport this — by the way, nearly — I was nearly arrested because — just for you I’m telling this, it has nothing to do with the story — because when we went to those countries, each time November 30, 2014 we came in, we had to show the passport, we had to tell them exactly how much money we have, in what — what currency, and also, I had to declare my jewelry, every si — piece that I had. And when Moshe left for Bucharest, I told you, he gave me the passport, the money, forgot this paper.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   Q: Ah. A2: And he left. And when I came to the airport, they ask for the paper, I didn’t have it. When I told them husband left and he took it [indecipherable] they nearly arrested me, because they told me I’m a spy, and I was — I sold my jewelry black market. Anyhow, I left. But it was terrible, I was nearly —
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   Q: Yeah, at the time it’s very scary — A2: —I— ye-yeah, no, no —
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   Q: — it’s very frightening. A2: — if I— yeah. So I left, I came to Brussels, and in Brussels I was — waited for him, I don’t know, three days. And then we decided if we don’t meet in Brussels I'll continue to London, and we’|l meet — we’ll meet in London, right? Yeah. This is how we left. Actually, there’s one little co — he was in London [indecipherable] how it was, I remember we were in Hotel dorte — Dorchester, yeah. At that time, when we traveled — I still have it, when we are in Israel years ago, we both made special cu — cu — leather coats, for me, one for him. And we were we — I was November 30, 2014 wearing this leather coat when I travel, and I had hat to match, also gloves. So — and also, at this hotel at that time, when you came with luggage, you didn’t go into the main entrance, there was a side entrance. And with the luggage you went to side entrance and checked in. As I was checking in, wearing the coat, all of a sudden he arrived, and I arrived, of course, with my taxi with my luggage, yeah. All of a sudden, he arrive with his taxi, with his luggage. And he comes to me, and of course we embrace. And — and I told my — the woman at the desk, oh, this is my husband. Cause I checked by myself first. So she looked, oh how did you find a husband, was what she said. Anyway, said, yeah, but he’s my husband — he [indecipherable] I was so excited, cause I didn’t know —
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   Q: It had been a wa — yeah. A2: I’ve — no — I didn’t even know if I’ll see him, because when he went for this mission it was very dangerous. But he knew — this time I d — I don’t know if you remember the —
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. A2: — atmosphere. And here I see him, he’s alive, he came back. So — so I was so excited. I said, but he’s by husband. So — so, yeah, but — but where do you find him? So — and there — lucky — he — he wore also the same coat, that I told you.
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   Q: Oh yeah. 100November 30, 2014 A2: So I look at — oh, look, he wears — wear — we have the same coats. And they let us so — 1f not the same coat — because his passport was still in his suitcase, and we were so excited we forgot to show them the passport, it’s the same name, we just show the co — the coat. So this is one little episode about that. Okay, what can we tell them more about the trip behind the cu — Iron Curtain? Is there anything else? Oh yeah, in Prague, was true — true stor — yeah, yeah. So this was one story, the Prague, that he wanted to give us children, right?
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   Q: Yes, yes, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   A: Okay, so let’s — Pll finish this and Pll have another story. When we were in London —
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   Q: So what happened with those children? A2: Wait. This is the story. When we were in London, Moshe got in touch with the chief rabbi, who was the che — Jacobowitz was? I don’t remember, who was rabbi che —
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   A: Jacobowitz. A2: Jacobowitz, yeah. And he told them the story. So — no, no, it wasn’t that s — that — that fast, no, no, no, no. It wa — it took a few years, because yeah. He — every year — okay — it’s po — it’s important. In Johannesburg Moshe was chazzan the shul. The shul was 1500 seats. But we have 2100 members. So 600 people davened 101 November 30, 2014 every Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the hall, that made it [indecipherable]. So Moshe brought this Singer to be the chazzan 1n the hall. But the Singer never was a chazzan, he was an opera singer. So we brought him a fa — I don’t know, a week or two earlier. And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him, learn si— he could read. He knew the davening, he was a Jewish — I told you a Jew, but he didn’t know the nusach, and chazzan 1s not just singing, it’s nusach. I don’t even know what I’m talking about, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   A: And yeah, he taught him and he beca — became the chazzan in — so he brought him for about three years —
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   Q: To Johannesburg.
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   A: — to Johannesburg to be the chazzan, and he got — he could take the money out, because he was a foreigner, and he took it back to — to — to Prague, and they had money extra. Prague was very bad at that time, I — I’d have to tell you, because I remember I was asking the hotel if they have an orange. They looked at me — and it was winter — they looked at me as if — as if I’m asking a diamond. An orange, winter, th-they didn’t ha — they didn’t have food. The only place — yeah, yeah, we took — they had one store for the tourists, and there was everything, and also for the communist, for the high — 102November 30, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   Q: Yeah, yeah, for the high ranking — A2: So, because we were tourists, we took him, you remember, to the store, and we bought him — I remember he bought sour cream, we never — sour cream for the children. He was so excited, he’d been missing for years sour cream. This 1s just an episode —
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   Q: Yeah. A2: — that was — I don’t know if it’s interesting. Okay, so this’ Il — yeah, later, later, we came to London, Moshe came to London, yeah, and he went to the chief rabbi, tell him the story. So the chief rabbi said, first of all, what we have to do, we have to take out the family, because how can we take — because we — we can’t take children without family, it’s important. So what did we do? They made co — a fake —a fi—a fictional — fiction contract, is that fiction, no. Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   Q: Fictional, yeah. A2: Fictional contract with a certain — with a shul that the rabbi arranged. They invited this Mr. Singer to be a chazzan in the shul for three years.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   Q: In London” A2: In London, and go to the government to show them the contract, and tell them we are going for three years, and why the — and they allowed him to take the whole family, why? Because in London they — they have — I don’t have other city in the 103November 30, 2014 world, but London has an international school, every language. So they have also school for Czech. So the government allowed them in — in — in — on condition that he takes them to — the children to school, the Czech, yeah, and he had to leave everything behind. He had to buy books and paper, as if he is going to a school. We knew it’s fiction, but —
  </p>
  <p id="620">
   Q: Yeah. A2: — he had to prove the government. And he left everything behind. Everything. All the ma — furniture, everything. And only what they — they could take some clothes and this, and they came to London. And they never went back, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="621">
   Q: Fantastic. A2: Yeah. And — and there were — he was in London for a short while, and then Moshe worked to bring them to Johannesburg. How do you bring a family from the communist country to Johannesburg? Impossible. South Africa didn’t have any connection with any — any diplomatic connection with those cun — any of the countries, communist countries then. So how — and how can you bring a family? I remember the public prosecutor in Johannesburg, Dr. Yuta(ph) was a great friend of ours, so Moshe went to tell him the story. Said I want to bring a family. They’re Jews, they’re not communists, I — I guarantee, and I want to bring them here. So, remember what Yuta(ph) told you? It ma — it made so he said, when here will grow 104November 30, 2014 hair, the government will allow a family to co — a communist country family to come to South Africa. This is what he told you, right? I remember that. But you don’t know Moshe, he doesn’t take no for an answer. He went to Pretoria — Pretoria the capital, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="622">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. A2: And he got in touch to the rabbi, Rabbi Katz, I remember, and he told him the story and he said, just make an appointment with the foreign minister, or I don’t know which minister had to do with the — with the papers, and he made the appointment with him, and he came to him and he si — talked to him. He said — he told him the story, and he burst out crying. He said, I am a Jew, he 1s a Jew. He 1s not a communist, he wants to run away from the co — do — and he burst out crying, and he touched this man’s heart, and he gave — he ba — he gave him the visas for five people.
  </p>
  <p id="623">
   Q: Wow. A2: Which is unheard of. Wait. Then when we — they brou — we brought them all. So yeah, first of all we had to collect money to send them tickets. And we brought them all, we find them an apartment, where to buy furniture [indecipherable] dishes, clothes, sink. The whole city wa — col — was sending. We — we — it was in the papers, of course, we put — the whole story was in the paper, and everybody 105November 30, 2014 brought something. We di — made the furniture. And Moshe gave him position, he became a cantor in Johannesburg.
  </p>
  <p id="624">
   Q: Wow. A2: He was there for years. When we left in ’70, South Africa, he was still cantor there. So this is a story.
  </p>
  <p id="625">
   Q: You sa — you saved his life, his family, fantastic. A2: Five — five people, five people saved. This is one story.
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   A: It’s not the only one. A2: Yeah, the other — yeah —
  </p>
  <p id="627">
   A: There is a doctor what I saved — A2: — this — I’m going to tell the other story. This also ve — a very interesting story, the other story. I didn’t mention you — to you that in — in the building, you see there next to the shul, there’s a building, yeah? On the left is the big, famous shul, but on the right, this 1s the Jewish community. And there is the only place where you can eat kosher, because they have a kitchen [indecipherable] kitchen. The food, I mean, mostly potatoes that time, there was much — not much to eat. But this is the only place we ate. When we went there for our meals, nobody will talk to us, because they saw — everybody was suspicious, thought we are spies, they don’t us, why should they talk to us? And even there, people didn’t talk anything personal, 106November 30, 2014 because they were afraid of the shadow, that atmosphere then, unbelievable frightening. And — and also, by the way, when we went to — to the — Singer’s home, he took us to his home, they were all sitting with coats, because they didn’t even have heating. This was 1n — in — in January, in winter, yeah. Terrible, terrible condition. [indecipherable] was — so okay, so one day, in the hote — in the restaurant, we met those two brothers in the restaurant over in shul where? Don’t remember where we met those two brothers.
  </p>
  <p id="628">
   A: I went to visit him. A2: No, but where did we meet the first — we didn’t know — whe-where did we meet the first time? In shul, or in restaurant?
  </p>
  <p id="629">
   A: No, I got to know that they are there, and I went to visit them. A2: You — who ar — did — oh, he told you, Singer told you.
  </p>
  <p id="630">
   A: Mr. Singer — A2: Yeah, all right. Singer told you know, you know there are two men from the same city.
  </p>
  <p id="631">
   A: We went to together in chayder. A2: Chayder, right. Two brothers from the city, from — from [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="632">
   A: One was the — and one was the Minister of Health, and one was the head of the NKVD. 107November 30, 2014 A2: No, no.

  <p id="636">
   A: Aye, aye, aye, aye. A2: Yeah, so one day when you were in the restaurant, when you left the restaurant, they were waiting for, the two brother, and they walked with us. The only place where people would talk to us when we were in the street.
  </p>
  <p id="637">
   Q: Yeah. A2: So all the Jews that didn’t talk to us in the restaurant, whenever we left, one or two stuck to us and — and he s — used to [indecipherable] out and tell us stories from his life; what they suffer and how they want to get out, but of course they couldn’t get out that time. And the same thing, those two brothers waited outside and we — they walked us to the hotel, and on the way to the hotel, they told us their life story. What was their life story? They both survived somehow -— they was also in a concentration camp. And after — after the war, they thought communism is of course the solution for everybody. You know, brotherhood, even — 108 November 30, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="638">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. A2: — many people believed — or at least they — they — it [speaks foreign language] So one became a high — a policeman. He was hiding.

  </p>
  <p id="640">
   A: The Minister of Health. A2: Yeah, okay, yeah. But on the street when they talked to us, they told us that it’s all a lie. They did it because they have to survive. They want to leave, they want to run away, they don’t know how. [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="641">

   Q: Okay, so that’s — A2: That’s another story. Okay, the other story is — yeah, the other story — that’s another story. When we lived in South Africa, I remember reading in the news that there was a woman that says the government chased her out because she claimed she bel — communism something they chased her out, and we didn’t know where she went, we didn’t remember the story. When we came to Prague, I don’t know, somehow we heard this woman lives in Prague and she is married, with — and the 110November 30, 2014 husband is a doctor and she has children, and they live in Prague. So I don’t remember how we got in touch with them, how we met, and they invited us to their home, and this is where the story — they told us they’re so happy — come on, if you want to tell the story, take it over. They believed that communism is — 1s — is — is the solution, and she’s dreamt all his life, da-da-da, and he’s a doctor there, and a wonderful happy life, da-da-da, wonderful.

He went — now — and — sorry — sorry, he went but he went by himself. I — the first time he went by himself for the high festival. So, just for the hagim, and he came back, and then he went for the second hagim. This was ’70 you went, ’71. Seventy-three we were — we went together, ’73, if you remember was the Yom Kippur War.

And when the Yom Kippur broke out, the [indecipherable] came to him and he said, you know the situation, why are 132 November 30, 2014 you going back’?

  <p id="795">
   A: I was very popular. A2: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="797">
   A: Nine hundred people on the concert. 133 November 30, 2014 A2: —1n me — yeah, in Mexico Moshe was one night in jail.
  </p>
  <p id="798">
   A: What? A2: You were in jail one night.
  </p>
  <p id="799">
   A: Yeah. A2: I’m telling the story.
  </p>
  <p id="800">
   A: Yeah. A2: Okay, the — you want to tell the story?
  </p>
  <p id="801">
   A: Yeah, what story? I had an accident. A2: This — okay, I’Il tell the story.
  </p>
  <p id="802">
   A: Yeah, an — an officer went in in my car. A2: Okay, let me tell the story.
  </p>
  <p id="803">
   Q: And — and — no, and?
  </p>
  <p id="804">
   A: A-A-And I — they — an officer was god in — in — in Me-Mexico. I had nothing to say. Straightaway jail. A2: Now let me explain, Moshe.
  </p>
  <p id="805">
   A: And then came a millionaire. A2: Now Moshe, please let me explain it, it’s — it’s a pity [indecipherable]. In Mexico was a law, if there’s an accident, whate — before anything, the two people have to go to jail, and then they clean out who, what, when. This is the law, yeah? 134November 30, 2014 So it’s important because when — and why did we have the accident? The man w- was a — later we found out he was an officer, he was drunk, and he w-went into ours in the back. Nothing happened to us, because — but he was bloody, because he — you know, he bang. So they took them to — both to jail, and this was [indecipherable] Pesach, I remember. Why I remember? Because we were on the way — way to Cuernavaca, he was supposed to give a concert, why in Cuernavaca? It’s a la — I have to explain it. Is a city an hour and 15 minutes away from Mexico, and there is one weather the whole year. The whole year, spring. Nobody knows why, but because it’s spring there, and Mexico City is —is 800 feet up, so the Jewish ho — old age home is in Cuernavaca.
  </p>
  <p id="806">
   Q: Oh, because of the climate. A2: So this is — yeah, so he wa — went to give a concert in the Jewish for — for Pesach [indecipherable]. And this is what happened. So they took — yeah, so when this happened, we’re standing. We didn’t run away, of course. And all the cars that passed by, that saw us standing, said run, run, because they knew they’Il take us to ] — to jail. Doesn’t matter who — who — who 1s at fault, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="807">
   Q: Who’s at fault, yeah, right. A2: So Moshe said, I can’t run away, I'll stay. Just only you go home. Because why should we both, you know? And he was the driver anyhow. So I — I went home. I 135November 30, 2014 don’t remember how I got home, because he stayed with the car. And they took him to jail. So, you’ ll tell what happened 1n jail, but I'll tell you what happened in Mexico. I went — I came home — we have — we have friends, as it happens, these very, very, very rich people, very. And I told them the story, they took Moshe to jail. What — what to do? I told them when it happened, told them where. So he said, leave it to me. He starts calling around. What happened, he could — they couldn’t find him. They didn’t know which jail he is. Why? Because — because the man, the injured man was an officer, they didn’t take him to — they took him to a — a hospital, an army office — in the ar — in the army, yeah? So that people couldn’t find him, they didn’t know. They checked all the civil hospitals, no, couldn’t find him. And they couldn’t find him, they can’t do anything. So later Moshe told me that he was in jail, sitting in a chair. It — they didn’t even —
  </p>
  <p id="808">
   A: Not just sitting in a chair, I walked around all the night — A2: The whole night, yeah.

   A: All the night walking around. A2: Yeah. Not drinking a f— glass of water, no for food [indecipherable] yeah. Okay, so this is — so what this friend of ours, what happened, yeah, it’s interesting, interesting how he found out. Moshe had another friend, he was the eye doctor. Remember the eye doctor that treated you? And he — this eye doctor treated in the army old officers, in the eye. Somehow he heard a story, I don’t know how, and he find out that — that this man 1s 1n jail in a hospital, a military hospital. And this is how we found him. Once we found him, Alfred t-t — he took —

We had — we — we — we got a telegram one day from south af — from Johannesburg. The telegram was, this was in 1973. And this was three years after we lof — left Johannesburg, yeah, ’73 — ’70 — left ’73. So the telegram 1s like this — so we still have the telegram. The telegram said so-something like this.
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   A: [indecipherable] Rivka, there 1s involved a lot of cantor, I don’t want. 139November 30, 2014 A2: I won’t mention the name. No, I’m not telling the story with this.

   A: — [indecipherable] he was [indecipherable] A2: So — yeah, so — so, the telegram, we were stunned. First of all that they remember, they want to help, money no object. And then said what trouble? They bin — did mention jail, so it just said big trouble, something like this, right? What 140 November 30, 2014 trouble? And I asked Moshe, tell me the truth, because Moshe [indecipherable] he never liked to tell me bad news. He used to tell me bad news much later. Can you imagine when my mother passed away in Israel and he didn’t tell me. He got a phone call, and he didn’t tell me. What — can you imagine? An-Anyhow, so I’d—I said, Moshe, look, this is the time, no secrets. Tell me what — when — do you know something happened to my family, your family? Nothing. I — I do — I don’t know anything that happened — what happen — to make the story short, you were — said, you know what? Let’s call the rabbi and find out what — what happened. But to call it’s not easy. It’s seven hours different. When we want to call it’s night there, an- and he’s a very busy man. I think he’s tried three time til we got him, too. When we got him, what happened? So — yeah, first thing Moshe calls, he said, Moshe, where are you? You’re not in jail? Where you calling from? He said home. You’re not in jail? No, what jail? So I heard y-yo — I heard you — what is, you were smuggle something? I don’t know. Anyhow, he’s caught something — doing something wrong, I don’t know what that 1s.
