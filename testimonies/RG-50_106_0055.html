He fought, but they let him go somehow. And he spent since he didn't know the language, so he worked in the coal mines. But later, when he learned the language, he wasn't someplace down there in Russia. Oh, he went when the Germans started, when the Germans came to Russia, he went, was it the Russian Army, different Russia, and he spent most since he didn't know Russian, so he had to work in coal mines. For foreign, we were financially well off. When my father died, he was heavy insured, so he left my mother, the sister a lot of money. So later, she bought property in Poland, an apartment house.

  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Before you leave Lodz and tell me what happened after you left Lodz, while you were growing up before the war, was there any antiSemitism in Lodz?
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: It was we didn't feel it, because it was a heavy populated Jewish city, and we the servants were all Gentile. The rest, the textile industry, was completely in Jewish hand and in German hands. I think German. When Poland was beaten, then the German came out with with flags, with swastikas to greet the oncoming Germans.

And later, they they took over my aunt, the sister of my mother, they took over the business. It was so so we lived together in one room. My mother had property in Czestochowa, so she thought that she will get an apartment there that we could live like human being. It take took us a long time until we got there. Well, when we traveled, we traveled by bus. When the bus couldn't make the hill, they said you | |Nrouse, and we had to push the bus up the hill.
