And if you would tell me how you were -- what kind of condition you were in, what your health was like, how old you were at that time, and 1f you remember what it- what your impressions were when you first came into Landsberg, the DP camp.

   A: When I came to Poland, I remember that a -- people recognized me, they knew who I was. And -- because we had a candy factory, my parents had that, and a restaurant, and I went to the candy factory because it was still there. And I had a cousin who came back from concentration camp, too. And I was hoping that somebody 1s there. I was there for two weeks. And I just left, I didn’t even tell them I would, I just left.

  <p id="17">
   A: Nobody was there.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Nothing. And your house, what was -- what had become of your house?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: We didn’t have a house. That’s what I just want to tell you, because this is interesting. I remember I was walking on the street, and I was si -- telling -- people were saying to other people, “She’s still alive, the Jew? She lives?” Not to me, because, you know. But I went to the house I was living, and I knock at the door, and the lady opened the door, and she ask me what I want. So I just put my foot in, and I said, “Please let me in, give me a glass of water, and I tell you who I am and what I want.” She didn’t want to, she was hesitant, she let me in. And I told her, “Please let me sit for a minute here, this is the house where I was born, where I had mine parents.” And she ask me, “Where are your parents?” So I ti -- I had to tell her this, that my parents are still on the farm, working. If I would tell her ’m Jewish, she would throw me out. And she was hesitant, and hesitant, but she let me stay there for a few minutes. And she said to me -- she talk with me, and I said, “Please let me stay.” And she said to me, “I have to go downstairs to get some water,” or milk, I’ve -- I forgot. And I said, “Would you please allow me to stay here?” She said, “I have to lock everything up, but you can stay in the hall and waiting.” And I want this. I want to go -- see, in Europe, when you -- when you wash your clothes, you hang it up in the attic.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Hm.
  </p>
  <p id="21">

  <p id="254">
   Q: You signed up to go to America.
  </p>
  <p id="255">
   A: They sign to come to America, but I have to tell you something about America. When I was 10 years old, I had a friend who was 17, her name was Marisha Messear. Sh -- you know, I loved her so much, she was like mine -- I looked up to her, she was like mine -- you have a word for it, like -- oh gee, I don’t know what I’m gonna do. How can I forget a word like that? It’s gonna come back to me. And one day she -- I knew that she has family in America, because she was always telling me about America, always. And one day -- and you know, I was very delighted, because I did -- I didn’t know much. You know, I was a kid then, too. So she calls me one day, and she said, “Let me ta -- show you what mine auntie send me from America.” I said, “I’m coming right away.” And she got those curlers, eye curlers.
  </p>
  <p id="256">

  </p>
  <p id="261">
   A: You can -- you can do whatever you want to, cause your parents can work, and make a good li -- she was telling me wonderful things. So I came home to my mother, and I ask her the [indecipherable]. Now she said USA, later she said America. I said, ““What’s America?” So she was telling me all the good -- good things about America, which they are, believe you me, she was telling the honest truth. So I went home to my mother, and I said, “Mama, I want to go to America.” She just -- she said, “Who di -- where did you get the idea to go to America?” I said, “I just came from Marisha and she was telling me what she always tells me,” for years, but tac -- I didn’t -- it didn’t go in mine head. I couldn’t understand. I said, “Do you -- do we know somebody, do you have a family in America.” So my mother said, “I don’t know, I’m going to have to check it.” And I always remember that I was battling for a long time with America. But later the war came, but I’m here.
  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: Yes.

  <p id="263">

  <p id="265">
   A: Yes, I was dreaming about to come to this -- when I was just a kid, and I didn’t know anything about America. I knew that somebody said to me in America you walk on the street and pick up gold. Okay. When you healthy, happy, you pick up gold, believe you me. It’s hard when you come, but you make it easy. I believed I was very determined that everything is going to be fine, and it is, thank God for it.

I couldn’t believe my eyes what I saw everything. You know, what’s -- to some people maybe this wa -- to me it meant -- every little thing was wonderful to me. Whatever I saw, I was happy, I was impress with everything. People I -- every person I met smiled to you, was kind, and this was the most important.

I was not embarrass, I was not -- it didn’t feel -- you know, nobody was condescending me. They were listening to me. So I repeat, and repeat until it came out right. People were very kind.
  </p>
  <p id="352">
   Q: Great, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   A: The first time when I went shopping, I have to tell you, was a market. I was waiting for the guy to give me something, so whatever he gave it to me, I brought it back to him, I said, “No good, no good,” because -- so he said, “You pick up yourself.” And I couldn’t understand what he was telling me, so he took mine hand and said pick, and put it, there is, you know, and that’s how I learned.

  </p>
  <p id="358">
   Q: Because you were not mistrustful.
  </p>
  <p id="359">

And I remember a lady came here, she said -- I was very happy t -- I didn’t know her, she came in, and I asked her to sit down, and I make her something to drink. And later I said let’s -- I ask her [indecipherable] she need for me to tell her something, or -- you know, I didn’t know her, but she came, she was very nice, and she said she came from -- she came -- she came for me to tell her mine experience. I said, “Look, you can’t,” --

   Q: She came from where? I’m sorry.

  <p id="573">
   A: She a -- she’s from America, she’s a lady, she’s -- I said, “You know, you should let me know a few days before.

I -- I couldn’t, I just couldn’t. You can ask a soldier, American soldier who went through. He can’t -- they couldn’t speak either. Because I met many American soldiers here in Richmond. They couldn’t talk. I don -- I remember there came s-some doct -- a ri -- a man came to our store with a lady, he’s doctor and she’s his nurse, to -- to do something, and we start talking. And you know, I have a -- I have -- you know that I have a accent. I said hello. So the lady said to me, “Sonia, ask him where he was in 1944.” So I said, “Do you mind?” He said, “I was in Dachau.” No, he said, “When I was liberated the people, I was younger, and I was in Dachau. And this 47 is my nurse, who was with me.” And I just went without nothing, just went and embrace him, and hug him, and give him a kiss. End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

   A: Yes.

  <p id="576">
   Q: -- at Dachau, and you hugged him.
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   A: Yes, I -- I -- I didn’t even think, but you know, he was mine hero. All the soldiers are heroes, every one of them. And they were all -- see, I was liberated by the Russians, but doesn’t matter. But look at the Americans, what they done. And they suffered, believe me. And I wish people would give them more respect, the older people here in this country. They deserve it.
  </p>
  <p id="578">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="579">
   A: And the families, too.
  </p>
  <p id="580">
   Q: It’s interesting that you felt a kind of a kinship with him, because you can talk about what had happened, and you sort of suggested --
  </p>
  <p id="581">
   A: Iki -- I --
  </p>
  <p id="582">
   Q: -- that it was hard for him, or hard for soldiers to talk about what had happened to them, too.
  </p>
  <p id="583">
   A: Sure, because I knew how hard it was for us, and I went through a lot, a lot. A lot soldiers were mistreated and hurt, and put to concentration camps, too. I tell all the sold -- even if I don’t know them, I tell them you are mine hero. They just give me this look. I said, “Please take my word for it, I know what I’m saying.” So they stop and talk to me, because they are our heroes. That’s why we can sleep in peace at night. Nobody [indecipherable] us, nobody bothers us.

  <p id="584">
   Q: What about the other survivors that you knew, did you talk to them, or was -- was it just kind of understood that people didn’t want to talk, or --
  </p>
  <p id="585">
   A: Some -- some people are here who are survivors, but they were not in concentration camp. They survived [indecipherable] other things. They survive a lot, too, but some survivors speak about those things, I don’t want to say. I -- I speak about wonderful thi -- I speak about our children, our -- our -- where we gonna go, what we gonna do. The first time when I went to the Holocaust Museum when they open, my husband went, Maria with her boyfriend, and I went. I couldn’t look. I was there -- a lady was there who saw -- she looked and she saw her picture when she was 17 years old, and she start screaming. And late -- the first thing when I went in, you had 1s the -- the German soldiers beating somebody, and right away you know what came to my mind, mine father and those Nazis. And when I went in, I cou -- I couldn’t look. I just couldn’t. It’s -- it’s -- I was a few times there, and I couldn’t.

  </p>
  <p id="588">
   Q: Yeah. In those -- in those years, or even now, do you -- do you try and understand what happened? Is there a way to explain it, or do you --
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   A: I do -- I -- I still don’t understand. Why? What did we done to people? I -- I -- I -- how can I understand those things? I would -- I would never be -- I don’t know. I just don’t know how to even express myself. When I was growing up, I was think that everybody’s nice, and kind, and good. Something like that -- so many chi -- I s -- I saw all those things happen.

  </p>
  <p id="620">
   Q: You felt it?
  </p>
  <p id="621">

  <p id="667">
   A: No, I’m not, I’m preparing for the bookkeeper, but I’m learning, and I told him to please, if I do mistake, write me a note. He said I don’t need it. So I’m grateful for it, too, learning something. It’s never too late, huh?
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: No. Let me ask you about for the last 20 years or so, in this country, since the late 70’s, early 80’s, there’s been a lot of awareness here about the Holocaust, and me -- much more films, and --
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: Books.
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   Q: -- books, articles, 1t’s everywhere now. For a long time you didn’t know too much about it, at least not in a public way.

  <p id="671">
   A: Yes, I knew about it.
  </p>
  <p id="672">
   Q: You did?
  </p>
  <p id="673">
   A: Yes, they were telling us in the Jewish center, and I read some books, too. But I mean, I’m grateful for it, that they wrote, but you know, you have to feel it on your own self. What people who -- some -- people understand. Some people say never happen. I don’t fight with them. Fine. But a guy came to mine shop, and we were talking, and he said, because I have little things written down on cards, and hang up every place -- something from the Torah, something how you should, aw -- beautiful things. We talk, and he ask me, “How long are you in America?” I said, “A few years.” I said, “I’m longer than you are, and you speak better English than I do.” So an -- and you -- because you were lucky, you went to school here, you know, and I couldn’t. I was deny -- we -- we were denying to go to school when we were young, too. So we were starting talking, and talking, and he ask me why -- I told him I came here after the war in 1949. He was a little bit older than I, and so he said to me, “Where were you?” So I said, “I am a survivor from those death camps.” “You are really?” I said, “Yes, I’m really.” And my husband has, you know --
  </p>
  <p id="674">
   Q: A number.
  </p>
  <p id="675">
   A: Well, he asked me where’s your number, I said I didn’t have a number, I just had a little thing like the soldiers, fifty th -- 53354, my number.
  </p>
  <p id="676">
   Q: You had it on a brace -- on a necklace?

  <p id="677">
   A: On a little things -- no, a little something hanging, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="678">
   Q: Uh-huh, but you didn’t have it --
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   A: Later, they took it away from me because --
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   Q: You didn’t have a tattoo?
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   A: No, not a tattoo. Well, we’re talking and talking, and he looked at me, said, “Is it really true?” You know, I said, “I had a mother, and a father and a brother, and a family, and uncles, and aunts, and friends, and teachers. It’s true.” He looked at me, he said, “Because people were telling me, and I didn’t believe them.” I said, “Why not?” “Because they were pushing it on me.” I said, “They didn’t push it on you, they were maybe [indecipherable] I would think, but it’s true.” He said, “You know, I believe you.” I said, “Okay, thank you.” And then he -- “I wish I would have -- I would tell you that it never happened, but it did happen.” He kissed me, and he thanked me, and he went.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: This was just a man that came into your store?
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: Yeah. Now he comes in from time to time. That’s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: But in these years -- in these last 20 years, a lot of survivors have been getting together? In groups?
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: No, no, it’s -- no-not -- not -- not here in Richmond, because many passed away, and a few are -- we talk to each other from time to time. We went to weddings of the children, to -- to 50 wedding anniversary, and it’s nice, but you know, everybody has a life, and they are busy. But when we see each other we are very happy to see each other. But with some you make friends, with some -- like I vi -- like [indecipherable]
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="688">
   Q: And what --

  <p id="690">
   Q: Yeah. What kinds of things did you do when you were active with those survivor’s groups?
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   A: We -- we were getting together, we had lectures.
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: Lectures?
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: Yes, and I had people coming from other cities, to meet with each one, speaking in University of Richmond, survivor.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: Talking about?
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: Talking about the same thing we are talking now.
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: Their experiences.

   Q: He came to speak at the university?
  </p>
  <p id="705">
   A: To -- to the University of Richmond, yes. We had other speakers. And it’s -- for us it’s a little bit harder, because sometimes we have the children, the grandchildren, so you know. I was very active, and I was going dancing with mine husband a few times a week. This was very important. Now I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="706">
   Q: No?
  </p>
  <p id="707">
   A: I go to weddings, but -- so, this is the [inaudible]
  </p>
  <p id="708">
   Q: So how -- how do you think that being a survivor 1s -- 1s -- affected your life? I mean, it’s an obvious question, and I mean, it affects you in every way, every day. But how do you think -- what qualities do you think you have that maybe you -- people -- other people your age, who were born here, for example, don’t have, or --
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="794">
   Q: Mm-hm, help them.

  <p id="809">
   A: Well --
  </p>
  <p id="810">
   Q: -- that happened to him, and does he know everything that happened --

   A: But we don’t talk about it.
  </p>
  <p id="816">
   Q: Once, and that’s it.
  </p>
  <p id="817">
   A: We talk about it, we don’t want it -- sometimes when he speaks -- when he speaks and I’m there, I start laughing to myself, and [indecipherable] people looked at me, because you know, I know all the -- and he -- he tol -- he was in Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="818">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   A: Yeah. He will tell you. And he was telling about his sister, and about his sister baby, and all those [indecipherable] about his father, but 1t’s so many years, you know. Sometimes I just remind him of -- talk about 1t. Now we are busy with the children, and the grandchildren.
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   Q: Yeah, yeah, it’s behind you.
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   Q: It is behind you?
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: No. And -- and some new -- it was so nice last night, we were called, a baby was born. It’s not mine cousin, it’s mine husband -- some cousin had -- her adopted daughter, but you can imagine -- they are so happy. And they told me please call si -- ca-call up your children. So I said to my husband, “Isn’t it wonderful to have a family?” Because we really didn’t have anybody when we are ca -- when we came here. Ver -- wu -- we were - we had the people we met here, from Poland, from Germany, from other countries. But I remember when I bought this house, it’s like, I ask my husband what should I do? He said you should take candles, salt, and bread. So I said, why. Candles to light so you would always have light. Bread so you would -- would never be hungry, but I don’t remember what -- why the salt. This I don’t even remember. I don’t remember. See, I ask him because I -- I didn’t know. He was a little older than I am, so he knows more. But I’m trying to learn, still.
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: Given the fact that it’s so difficult for you to talk about those things that happened to you, why did you want to do these interviews, and how -- you did an interview with the Holocaust Museum --
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   A: Because it -- yes.
  </p>
  <p id="828">
   Q: -- and I could see when I watched that video interview, the pain that you had, just even when those thoughts crossed your mind. You don’t even have to say them, it’s clear. Well why -- why do you do these interviews now”?
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   A: I think it’s important. I think we all have to speak. See, I just can’t -- I would love to say something, I just can’t. I -- everything is engrave in mine heart, but I just can’t -- I -- I just can’t. I just want to tell you I saw too much, too much. I hope nobody any place will see it. And sometimes this is mine testimony, okay, for the people who were slaughter, and perished. So maybe I can speak -- Ic -- I cannot speak for them, I know I cannot. But maybe a few words. I just hope that the history will never repeat such self. And nobody will be prosecute -- prosecute from any reason, for any reason.
  </p>
