The only thing I remember very well -- and there was a boy, maybe he was nine or 10 years old, and he was starving very much, he was -- you know, she wanted to eat, and there was no -- no food. And he escaped. He was with his mother, and what I do remember very well, that his mother was hoping that she will come back ever. And she was staying -- there was a -- as you know, a gate from the same o -- for barbed wire, on the wooden posts. And she was staying and looking through the -- through this gate, and I remember her back. Very possible she was a big woman, or very -- very possible -- she seems to me a big woman. But her wide ba -- back, I never forget. This back was, you know, you can see in her back [indecipherable] by her back how she had the pain, and the- and she was staying when they were coming. This is al -- always, always you can see her. She was staying with her face to this gate. It was such a -- you know, to -- I remember even how I fe -- I felt about her, this pain. I didn’t remember this boy, but I remember that my mom say, “Because you don’t want to eat, do you see what happen?” This is -- this wo -- this I remember. And I remember when I was working, Dr. Girsh sometimes and he took me to his -- to hi -- to the place he -- he used to live, but this was in the same ghetto, bi -- if he in the same [indecipherable] from the barbed wire [indecipherable] you know, the -- the place.

And she ha -- once she had the white blouse, another time she took me, she had the red blouse. And I remember the blouses, because being a girl [indecipherable]. I paid attention, because everybody was gray, everybody was in gray, and here were colors. And what I remember, you ma -- from time to time the Germans were coming to the -- to ghetto, and everybody was so afraid because you know, German al -- always brought the death with them. And everybody was trying to hide somewhere. Once I remember we’re trying to hide in the deep cellar, and there was a ladder without -- with sa -- with missing some, you know, some this -- what is the -- with -- ladder with some missing --

And I remember, my memory, why he think that I will cry? I am afraid the same s -- the same way, I would not cry, but I will not express it because my mom say to me do not open my mouth, and I didn’t open my mouth. And they let us in.

I remember once I went out and smell dragged me to -- and happened to be -- could you mention -- I remember this very -- the smell very well. It was a cheese which two Germans in the commert truck were sitting and eating from plastic boxes. It was like soft cheese, you know, so soft cheese, and they were eating like -- like this. And this smell of cheese was dragging me so hard. I was going there and I was staying and looking at them. But when they turned they faced me, I got scared, and I ran off.
  </p>
  <p id="329">
   Q: And you ran away.
  </p>
  <p id="330">
   A: Yeah. And this smell I brought with me after the war.

  <p id="331">
   Q: But you remember the smell.
  </p>
  <p id="332">
   A: -- after -- after the smell, and after the war, it -- the smell brought me this memory. And after I remember that it was a big [indecipherable], 1t was, you know, less something happened, and did you know, everybody was so excited, and Dr. Girsh wanted to take my mother and me somewhere. And my mother didn’t want to go. And they put my mother -- the how they will -- they put her like Sima into the bed, this one bed, put 0 -- 0 -- over sh- her, all that clothes and the sheets, and put me on. And there was a soldier who came for my mother. And my grandmother was talking to him. And I didn’t understand when my gran -- grandmother learned it to -- to speak Romanian, or German. It happened to be Ukrainian. She was a traitor, she was a polizei. But my mother was talking to him and I did not understand Ukrainian -- Russian -- I understood Ukrainian -- Russian --
  </p>
  <p id="333">

  </p>
  <p id="337">
   Q: The Germans when they leave will kill you.
  </p>
  <p id="338">
   A: Yeah. And that why Dr. Girsh wanted to take -- very possible my mother was one of the youngest one. I didn’t know why -- I didn’t know why. Ma -- he wanted to take my mother and me with him to Romania somewhere. He was writing -- he was writing because he -- he didn’t belong to -- actually to -- to Germans, and he didn’t belong to Russian. He -- he was not -- you know, he didn’t belong to anybody. And he wanted to -- to take us, and my mother didn’t want to go. I didn’t know for which reason absolutely, you know, it was not nice talk about it, because I remember that -- maybe -- maybe my father was jealous about this, I didn’t -- I don’t remember, but it was not -- not mentioned at home.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>

And happened to be that rest of the Jew, who actually lived there, didn’t have place to go, and they went to the same house. And the house was packed, nobody can sit. The house was very little. Now, when -- when I remember, that was really very, very small village house. She was baker, so she lived over there by herself. But again, because she was my grandmother’s friend, I was privileged. I was put on them -- you know, this fireplace they have like in -- in the village, where they used to bake bread, cook in the same, and if -- there was like a p -- piece like they can sleep when -- in wintertime, when [indecipherable] was cold, they were sleeping over there. She put me there, but there was no air to breathe. It was that the house was packed, and nobody allowed to open the window or door, because everybody was afraid that -- th -- th -- of this noise, the German will -- will do -- would hear us and kill us. And she put me on this -- and to -- to make me breathe she was -- sh-she was pu -- she put a paper and sugar on fire, and this way she told she will clean up some air for me. I didn’t know this was -- this was the way -- this I remember, the sugar and the -- and -- and the paper, and I was licking the sugar. I was licking the sugar. I was -- it was °44. This was 1944.

They -- and somebody told my parents. My grandfather was very old. He remarried. He was widowed and he remarried my grandmother, who was the same age which is hi-his eldest son, who actually emigrated to Argentina.

So some was [indecipherable] returned. My mother had only one sister, who was at war, too. And she was evacuated with her hospital which she was working for. She was like nurse’s aide. And she was ni -- she was educated like -- like some kind of languages. She used to teach Russian literature in school. She was educated and a -- in this -- in this field. But at war, nobody need -- needs lit -- literature [indecipherable] understand. She was a -- a nurse’s aide. She was the one who was -- who was running after the wounded soldiers, and bringing them the [indecipherable] and relocating them to the hospital. A very brave woman, and when she got the -- she got pregnant, she was evacuated with her hospital to Uzbekistan. And -- and this Uzbekistan now. And somehow, during this time we stayed in Brailov, we -- we found out that she is alive. My grandmother, you understand? You understand what -- what happened. We were crying again, it was such a happiness. And once my grandmother gave me, it was the very possible Friday night, 1t was summer, because I was dressed very light, was very warm. She gave me a bath, and she was -- she- we were staying outside this -- this room [indecipherable] steps, and we staying here at- | was sitting on the step, and she was feeding me with those gray noodles.

Absolutely black, I never saw such black people ever in my life, the -- even after. And was her daughter, my aunt, with her new hu -- with her husband and her boy whom she -- whom she gave birth to in 19 -- in the summer of 1942. He was born in ni -- 1942. He was three -- three years younger than me. And it happened to be that they arrived in the machine room of the train, and -- where the coal was. That’s why they were so black. They were [indecipherable] when -- when they came in with silver, sil -- the war still was there, and we were hiding sealed near the wall and [indecipherable] and I remember this boy was sleeping on somebody’s -- I was not sleeping because I was afraid of this bombing, and he -- he was sleeping, he was sleeping like no -- nothing happened. And this was -- and we mo -- moved to another apartment which in -- which I was given a corner, and my toys were sh -- matchboxes, which I was cover -- covering with pieces of material, old material, and this was my furniture, I was moving it around, and from one of the assignment to vin -- to Vinnitsa, my father brought me my first book. It -- it’s was a fairy tale about a frog -- a fr-frog which turned to the princess eventually. It was very nice book, I remember. It -- and it was actually falling apart, but I was keeping it together.

And when they kicked out him from job, they kicked out from -- from -- from apartment, and my mother was staying 1n the sa -- with the same coat, with same blanket. It was November, and weath-weather was like this, was rainy, and we didn’t have where to live, and w -- we lived -- we moved in with my aunt, who occupied it with her family, to this time three children.

  <p id="588">
   A: And we moved in, and they sta -- stayed in some so obscure village, this was nothing, just horses, it is a -- I remember. And these horses were brought u -- brought me to school, like four kilometers from this place. Sometimes when the horses could not go because of snow, I was walking this -- this distance, in high boots. And the village was -- because we lived -- before we lived in Vinnitsa, and I had city clothes. And we ca -- when we came to village, we could not change, there were no money for change. And the boys were beating me up because of the short dresses. I remember I was afraid of the -- I was afraid of everything, I was afraid of those boys, I -- I was afraid to se -- to te -- tell my mother that I was beaten, because my mother was -- had trouble all by herself, with this little kid in her hand, with my sister, and no place to live, my father jobless. And you know what it means Russia when you kicked out from one place? Everybody knows about that, it is -- because you have so-called working passport, it’s written 1 -- eventually my father f -- managed to fi -- find a job another village. Soon we moved to this village. There was a guy -- in this village a plant, was very nice plant, was very nice place, there were a lot of Jewish kids which I mingled with. And all of a sudden, there was a gra -- it was 1951. There was a guy by name Swigun, I remember him very well. He was ki -- he came as a assistant of director of this plant. Nobody need, the plant wasn’t not such big, nobody need assistant, but he was assigned it’s assistant. All Jew were kicked out of this plant during the next week. And these people were staying out of the apartments like we used to stay, and my father found out before. He went to Vinnitsa, and he found another job, and we moved out, we were not kicked out. This time we were not kicked out. But the old people, I remember my friend, her name was Claudia, too. She was my girlfriend. Her- her grandmother was paralyzed, and they were dragging her out, there was no -- no -- out on the street. This I remem -- it was after the war. I was afraid of everything. There was [indecipherable] there were -- th-there was --

  <p id="591">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   A: It was -- it was horrible life after the war.
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   Q: And you were conscious of being Jewish, it was very clear that you were Jewish?

  <p id="594">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   A: This -- you know, I am proud now. I was very conscious to be Jewish, and I never -- you know, never hiding this. Besides, I always fe -- I felt that I am Jewish. Only place where was good for me, it was this -- this -- before this Swigun came, because there were -- I -- other Jewish boys and girls, only -- only -- but it was very -- for very short time.
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   Q: And then it was difficult for you to identify as Jewish yes?
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   A: Yeah, yeah, it was very difficult. It was der -- very difficult, for one reason. I was taken by my very far aunt to Leningrad.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   A: I was like from -- from -- from fifth grade to eighth grade I stayed in Leningrad. This was the worst -- worst time in my life, because there I was identified as a Jew, and nobody wanted to speak. I didn’t have friends. Absolutely I didn’t have friends, I will -- I was by myself. I remember very well always listening to the rad -- to the radio. I knew all operas for -- which were translated by -- by radio, by heart. Because I didn’t ha -- only school and home.
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   Q: And home.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   A: And my aunt, she was lonely woman, and she was deaf, and she was -- she was not very nice. I believe now she was -- she had this -- some kind of mental sickness. Not if I was afraid with her, but I was aggravated with her. She was t -- she was telling me bad stories about my grandmother, which I didn’t believe, of course I didn’t believe, my grandmother was entire world for me. And she was telling me bad -- bad stories about her, I didn’t like her, and I e-eventually one summer, and during the break, I didn’t go back to Leningrad, I stayed in the village. And -- but to this time, before of my father has a but -- had the position in -- on the plant, being I was one Jewish, and another Jewish was my sister. And I had a friend who was half Jewish, her father was Jewish. And for him it was very difficult to get a job. His mo -- her mother was working, and her father was taking care about household, because he could not --

  </p>
  <p id="604">
   A: He could not get a job. And my father would not be able to get -- give him a job, besides he g -- he got the position. It was -- you know, there was a choice, or you working, or you giving the job to -- to another Jew, and you will both be kicked out of the plant. It was very difficult time, horrible time, we were -- we -- I -- I remember my mom, who’s -- she was -- she was very skilled cook. She was making potato soup, and some kind of stuffed potato skin for the second course. And there wa -- there was only meal. And eventually we got a cow, and my mom, who was actually a city girl -- a shtetl girl, she didn’t know - she was taking care about this cow, and we had the milk. And I remember people are coming with glasses to our house, asking for a glass of milk.
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   Q: Ah, you had a cow.

  <p id="617">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="618">

   A: I -- I will say they hated -- I hate people in Leningr -- and beside my sister used to live in Leningrad, because she diyako -- she made it to a b -- a boy who was student in Leningrad, and they used to visit her. And I tried to see beauty around, it was difficult for me. You know, I saw these people, and these people who had a gray faces, believe me, this -- they had a -- I don’t know from lack of vitamins, they had gray faces, very severe look. And this -- this what I remember about Leningrad, I didn’t like it. And when Stalin died, I was crying like everybody else, I was a girl, you know, everybody was crying, and I thought that di -- you know, the end the world. Everybody was crying. And I came to school crying, and this girls was staying like this, “Are you crying? Because you Jew killed Stalin.” Because there was a story with Jewish doctors --

   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="633">
   Q: You knew this, they di -- never taught that.
  </p>
  <p id="634">
   A: No. Even the word ghetto never mentioned, even when I got the job, already not first of my job. I had to put e-every -- every time when you go to -- to new job, you have to make autobi -- biography, put on the paper. And you have to cover the full time for during the war. And I wrote on occupieded territory. I di -- I would not able -- I didn’t even know that ghetto is -- has two t. I didn’t know because I never wrote, I never read word ghetto, never. Never mentioned it. A-And I wrote that I was in occupied territory. And my supervisor, who so -- who wanted to give me a job, he was a Jewish -- old Jewish man, he said, “It’s so bad that you were on occupieded territory.” I thought, if you would count, I was two -- from two to four years old, what -- what’s such a does -- what did, you know, what actually can -- what harm to the Soviet Union I can make in this -- in this age? And the -- when I told the story to my friend, just treat it like a joke, he -- they -- one of my friend made a -- a [indecipherable] poetry, I lived in Russia, about me being a spy in -- a spy in two years --

  </p>
  <p id="637">
   Q: Nothing --
  </p>
  <p id="638">

  </p>
  <p id="639">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="640">
   A: -- for -- that we were in ghetto. No place. And we got a few -- two women who all knew, or were in ghetto, I don’t remember. And they signed a paper which -- which we notarized. And we brought this paper, and my mother, because we -- we -- we want something to -- to -- for my mother, for -- my mother was the one who was suffering the most here. I was a child, you know. My memories and s -- she actually does -- it is her and my grandmother’s y-you know, also --

   Q: [indecipherable] yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   A: -- also honors that I survived, actually. This 1s -- this is for them. And when we brought this paper to some organization here -- she brought, with my husband, because I was at work already, and my husband was the one who was taking care with her -- he was working, too, but they were very close, my parents and my husband were very close, we ve never had any problems with this -- in this -- the was th -- he was considered the son 1-in the family. And when she came to some organization, there were Russian who working in this organization, not Jewish, Russian. I don’t know how -- va -- which way they ki -- they used to ki -- to come here, and they said, “Where did today -- obtain this paper, on Brighton Beach?” And my mom [indecipherable] her face, she -- she said, “I don’t want to have you with this any more. I don’t want this any more.” She turned her face, and very soon she died f-for -- not able to -- she -- she was killed by car, th-that was sudden.

   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="657">
   Q: -- and you’re going to university, are there many people who were from Jewish families who admit they’re Jewish, or are most people hiding the fact that they’re Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="658">
   A: I will tell you something. When I have to go to school -- we lived in village. When we came with my mother, we came to Kiev because I wanted to -- I wanted to study in the same school which my father did for [indecipherable] like this family. And I came to Kiev, and in fren -- y -- this was not the si -- subways train outsti -- outside train. I saw Jewish faces, I decided that I want to live here, because I was so afraid about -- o-of big cities after Leningrad, being outcasted so much, that when I saw here Jewish faces, and Kiev was a f -- the fa -- city of the -- a lot of Jewish people lived because still before the revolution, and everybody who survived bu -- came back to Kiev and in Kiev somehow you can -- it was difficult anyway, being Jewish [indecipherable] was very difficult. But anyways, better than Leningrad, for example. And for -- I stay in Kiev, and I don’t know for which reason, but my memory, I was befriending only Jewish boys and girls. I -- for some reason -- by the way my sister didn’t -- did not, she married a Gentile, she married that Russian, I was -- very -- very possible because I suffered from an -- anti-Semitism all my life, being o-only one in school, and being one in school in Leningrad, and being so outcasted, that I want to be among my -- among my own.
  </p>
  <p id="659">
   Q: But you were clear that people looked Jewish, to you?

   A: Yes, I was.
  </p>
  <p id="665">
   Q: Hm.
  </p>
  <p id="666">
   A: Most of the time I was Jewish -- I was correct. And I stayed -- I rented the c -- it -- it cal - it call a corner, 1t means a bed. And my lane -- landlady was Jewish, and I was very anxious to bring everybody whom I meet, and whom I befriend to -- for -- for her to see them, because she has to know whom I am with, because you know, that she -- very possible she’s -- you know, t-the -- I want to -- her to know that I -- that everything 1s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="667">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   A: And this way I use [indecipherable] Jews, and I thought that if they are Jewish, they are okay. I don’t know, I was like a [indecipherable] running to the [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   Q: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   A: -- boys and girls --
  </p>
  <p id="671">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="672">
   A: -- but anyway, I thought if they are Jewish, and they have family Jewish, it means that they okay, they brou -- they brought up properly, that mean they’d -- are not --- and they - and besides, everybody went -- try to go to ha -- to college, or 1s in the college, which means, you know, it means that, you n -- they’re certain level --
  </p>
  <p id="673">
   Q: Uh-huh, right.
  </p>
  <p id="674">
   A: -- of, you know, the education, makes people -- first of all, they very occupied that -- with- with lessons, and with -- and they didn’t have time for -- for bets -- the -- for -- for betting. And very soon time of Khrushchev came, Stalin died. There was this open letter, so called. Y-You know, when they open letter was read, 1 -- I was still in high school. I believed every word right away. I didn’t know about it. But in my home sometimes, my father mentioned something. But believe me, I was very much against this because I want to be like everybody else, I want to mingle with -- with -- and my father was so against government, against the -- you know, he didn’t show it -- beside that cu -- beside -- behind the door of our apartment. But --
  </p>
  <p id="675">
   Q: You mean ou -- you mean -- oh, you mean outside the door.
  </p>
  <p id="676">
   A: Outside the door.
  </p>
  <p id="677">
   Q: But inside, he did.
  </p>
  <p id="678">
   A: But inside, sometimes he mentioned it.
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   Q: So, did you consider yourself a Communist in some way?
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   A: You know, pioneer.
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   Q: Pioneer, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   A: But no Communist.
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   A: When it came time to be even in Komsomol, even in young Communist party, I was tre -- cynical all right --
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   A: -- de -- about all this hi -- all this. And when Khrushchev came, and all my friends and me, we started to read the literature, which was -- which was prohibited in Stalin’s time.
  </p>
  <p id="687">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="688">
   A: And of course from that time I was -- you know, I didn’t believe exists a -- a civil government forever -- fo -- fo -- from -- from this particular time. This -- I’ve -- when -- when I was growing up, I was already re -- ready to go.
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   Q: You were ready to go.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   Q: So, can you explain to people what it meant to be a refusnik?
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   A: Again, I was [indecipherable] a refusnik. Because first of all we get the job, because of us trying very hard. My husband had very bad job. He had to change the job to be a refusnik, and he was -- like my father refused to ta -- tell me look at this, what she made of that -- of this guy, he was a man, a mensch [indecipherable] and now he be -- he became a frightened man because he -- he used to bring his is d -- you know, these gloves, this -- you know, the fa -- because he, who very -- very often he -- he had to, you know, to load the truck and unload the truck. And it was really very difficult. Besides, we were -- because of my husband had to change a job, his salary was half of the salary here he used to have. And because of everybody’s salary was from -- just fr-from salary to salary, we suffered a lot. And only because of again, my mother was a very -- you know, fu -- very frugal cook, this is how you can survive. We did -- didn’t -- we never had any savings on us, ne-never had. And at work I never talk to anybody about America, about my intention to leave. Everybody knew because they had to take paper, and they supposed to, you know, condemn me in voice. The -- the lot of people who just supported me, but they suppose -- what they supposed to. And I remember even this old man who is- who fa -- who didn’t want me to write that I was on occupieded territory, he was the one who supposed to condemn me. And he didn’t know how to do it. He said, “Look at this, I work fo -- with you for such a long time. I never knew that you wanted,” he didn’t know what to -- v -- what -- what else bad to s -- to tell. He didn’t know. I was like everybody else, I was coming to work, I was a consciousness at work, I was doing -- I love my work always. And you know, I was brought up as -- you know, I have -- if I come -- if they gave me work, I have to --
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   Q: Do it.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   A: -- | -- | have to do it.
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   A: And -- and actually it was -- actually it was difficult to complain about me. And I wanted to tell one story, because this story was significant enough. When there was, you know, the -- su-supposed to be meetings to condemn me, to tell bad thing about me, that -- to -- that I am a traitor, I want to leave my country, my cuze -- you know, my Fatherland -- Fatherland for some kind of America, a-and supposed to be like this. And somebody supposed to represent me. There was this foo -- of general -- retired general who was a head of personnel department, who was very nice, because he was -- he -- he -- he grew up among Jewish boys and girls who help hi -- him before the war, be -- became a man sh- and they decided -- in my division, they decided that head of division would not go because they will re -- 1 -- j -- remind him of all the mistakes we made. You know, he -- head of department, e-everybody. So he decide -- decided that his assistant will go, that’s me. And his assis -- assistant was Jewish. He was very nice, very handsome man. Handsome and to -- could -- you know, everybody in the -- in this -- in my cu -- company was talking about h-how nice, and how handsome he 1s. He is now here. His name is Weiss. I --I would like to have his -- his name, because I never forget what he had done for me. And he was s -- s -- charming, and he was the one, if there was some problem, he was sent to -- to -- to sol -- to solve this problem because he was very charming, everybody was -- you know, was -- was charmed by him, was the -- because he was the -- he -- he was the one. And he f -- everybody, they decided that he will represent me. Like when we came, there was a committee. There was a -- a chief engineer, who was -- he wa- who was a Schwarz, he was a anti-Semite. I didn’t know before, because I -- you know, on my position, then his position, we were very far from each other. I didn’t know. There was this Barbara, which I told you, who -- who was assistant of this h-head of personnel department, who was a cou -- who was undercover KGB, everybody knew that s-she is undercover to KGB, but what can we do? And a lot of other people, among them are Jewish people, too. Was a secretary [indecipherable] of party secretary, who was anti- Semite number one. But he was drunk, I remember where f -- my friends who was working, they said, “Oh, you know, we had to make a picture of him, how sometimes he will -- he is coming from work, he could not walk, he went to -- to -- to the train [indecipherable] and this pi -- picture will -- will make him tell about you the bad thing.” But then nobody made this picture, and -- and there was few other people. And to keep me at work, which I ask them to keep me at work, do not fire me because I knew that we will be refusniks, and we have to survive somehow. This, you know, assistant is Yuri Wizer, this what I thought, he who represents me, said about me good things. And he signed up the punishment for him. And now everybody said, “How can you tell about a traitor, about the person who want to leave he -- her Fatherland, good things? She’s the worst person we can di -- how can you?” And everybody forgot about me.
  </p>
  <p id="697">
   Q: And started --
  </p>
  <p id="698">
   A: -- for the moment, and started with him. And it was like for two hours. I will tell you, I was so tense. I didn’t know how will I come tomorrow to work and look in his eyes, if he will still here after everything they told about him, and this Barbara, who happened to be- you know, she -- of course she liked him, but he was -- he was very respectable man, that was far for her. She was -- she was the one who was -- her -- her language was the most -- the most -- the most powerful against him. And after two hours, we walked out in silent. We didn’t talk to each other. Everybody came. He went to his office, he had the private office, and I came to my -- and -- to my room where I work, and nobody from co- workers ask me how it -- everybody saw. And was so silent, nobody was talking, everybody understood that there’s something to -- something terrible happened. And I didn’t know if they will keep him at work. I -- I didn’t think about myself already because I felt so bad about him being so brave to -- to -- to represent me.

  </p>
  <p id="710">
   A: A refusnik actually, what does it mean? It means when you apply to leave the country. You apply to special organization -- organization for special permission, which actually belonged to KGB. It is -- 1t is a division --

   Q: Refusniks.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   A: Yeah. And being on this special list, you have a special treatment, according to it. It means that actually -- well better -- you better do not apply for another job, for different job, because not only -- you know, if -- or very possible, people who give you the job don’t know about that you’re a refusnik, and you don’t o-offer it, you don’t talk on it to them. But in while, their in-information will come to the personnel department, every company had the personnel department, and every personnel department had somebody from KGB. And eventually this information will come.

  </p>
  <p id="723">
   Q: [inaudible]
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   A: -- that you tell them from the state. That why you have to be very careful when you talk on the phone, what you talking about.

Of course we cou -- could not change a job, we could not move, we’re -- oh, about moving from town to town, when Chernobyl happened, our son lived -- was in Moscow as a student. And actually before Chernobyl he could get an assignment too after the college, because in Russia was -- in [indecipherable] was the rule, you finish the college, and you work according to your assignment. You don’t look for who -- for -- for your job, you have to work two, three years where they send you. And after you can -- you can be free.

  <p id="733">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>

   A: And it was possible that he can come back to Kiev, it -- 1t was possible because he was a [indecipherable] student, he had -- he had the privilege of his hi-high -- high marks in -- in college. He had some kind of privilege to choose the place. But when Chernobyl happened, we didn’t want to -- him to come back to Kiev, because Kiev became dangerous city to live, especially nobody wants to -- for their children, to live th -- this -- and we started to think maybe we will move some -- somewhere close to him, you know, change -- we had the -- not the bad co-op apartment which my parents helped us to buy, and they lived with us, and this was our actually ti -- we left this apartment. We left because of there was, you know, we were allowed to bring in United State, 150 dollars, which is -- which was equivalent to 3,000 dollars -- or 300 dollars in Russian -- in Russian money. And our apartment that time was six and a half thousand dollars, which is, you know, anyway this money -- we g -- we got some money we left to -- from my mother-in-law a little bit, little bit to my sister’s mother-in-law, little bit, but you know, this is actually nothing. I actually can buy this ga -- dress for this. This is -- this is the only thing we ca -- could d -- could do. And in this -- this is 150 dollars, which we were allowed to take -- take with us. And what -- and --
  </p>
  <p id="735">
   Q: Did you move from Kiev?
  </p>
  <p id="736">
   A: No, and we were trying to move, and we actually found an apartment not far from Moscow, it was not in Moscow, it is one of -- one of the small towns around Moscow. But was such thing we could not move, because of prescription to this particular place. But this is not only refusniks, this was in -- in Russia there was a rule, you prescribed to this apartment. And you could not move.
  </p>
  <p id="737">
   Q: [indecipherable] you can’t move, yeah.

   A: Not only to another city, to another -- to -- to another apartment. To -- to -- you have to have permission, government permission to move from this apartment to -- government permission to -- for to move from one apartment on. And this is of course we could not -- we -- we could not move, it just -- we just found it, but it didn’t go -- go fast, no paper were -- were from -- allowed. And actually this is -- this is what [indecipherable] and wh- what -- w-we were under -- under control --

  </p>
  <p id="747">
   Q: Yes? Yes?
  </p>
  <p id="748">
   A: Sure. First of all, why? Because -- because of the situation, the [indecipherable] sit -- situation, there aren’t -- anti-Semitism was government politics. It was permissible to not take people to the college. By the way, I h -- I was a [indecipherable] enough student, and for to get to the college, you have to -- to get exams, you know, exams, tests, tests.
  </p>
  <p id="749">
   Q: Yes, tests, right.
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   A: Tests was very hard, harder than the -- than tests in school, like five, six times, believe me. Very -- very often there was a -- they questioned you, something which is absolutely out of the school program, just to make you -- and my husband, he will tell you, he -- he - he went through, just to make you do not answer it. And there was a score, 25 it was the biggest one, 24, was permissible, I had 23, and I could not get to the co -- to the college, but with same mark my landlady, who I hired the corner from, she helped me to go to another school not so prestigious, li -- like I want to, and was really not very famous, but that’s it, I went to this school and I graduated that -- that school, which didn’t give me the profession I wanted, absolutely.

That’s why I was able to work at night, and I love this -- I like this [indecipherable] production. I knew everything about that, and I loved it, and I wanted to- but it was impossible actually, the -- I actually don’t know anybody of my age, Jewish, to be in this school, during this time.
  </p>
  <p id="755">
   Q: Uh-huh, during that time.
  </p>
  <p id="756">
   A: Yeah, and that why he -- why by the way n -- a lot of Jews [indecipherable] from Kiev went to different obscure towns in Russia, where they didn’t even saw Jewish -- Jews before. And they didn’t pay attention to it. And they got -- they studied there, not only because they were [indecipherable] refusing thing, they were Jewish.

But I decided to leave, I wanted to leave. And I left this military p- plant, where to go? There was only design companies, very bad pla -- factories, very, very old fa -- old military productions, this is -- was, and my neighbor ca - say to me, you know, in structural depart -- department, we’ll always need people. And I was an engineer here on -- on the plant, and I went as a technician, actually as a drafter -- draft -- draftsman for -- for -- to -- in structural department. And very soon, because you know, I had the background, I had the -- from I had the college background, I -- to -- very soon I understood what -- what we’re doing. And the group of people moved it -- it’s before we were refusniks.
  </p>
  <p id="763">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="764">
   A: It is -- was before -- before we applied, because my husband still could not find a job, he was still working on -- and you could not apply, because nobody will take documents from us, because he 1s working on such a secret plant. Besides, he didn’t -- being a Jewish, he didn’t have the -- the -- a level of secrecy he -- he would -- the -- really he -- he’s supposed to have on his position, a foo -- over there, he -- he’s supposed to have, but they didn’t give it to him because he was Jewish.
