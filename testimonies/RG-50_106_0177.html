  </p>
  <p id="1310">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1311">
   A: How? Because we saw that he was the most powerful country. We were taught all our life that th-the Soviet Union cannot fa-fail, and we were terribly astonished that he still failed. Gorbachev was the man who contributed to this. You know, it was terribly astonishing. We were here already, and watched on the TV what was happening. Otherwise, we couldn’t watch.

   A: But still, we were thinking, so much blood for this system, which was, you know, so much — so much war, and so much revolution and everything for the October 15, 2009 system, and finally, just fell. We thought that it will never happen, because of the propaganda, which was always that it is the most power — powerful country, and it will always persist. No. See? The Soviet Union fell. Who thought about that? We were so astonished that we couldn’t believe.
