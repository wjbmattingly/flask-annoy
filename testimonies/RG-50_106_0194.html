   Q: Yes, please tell us.
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   A: Three, we had three bedrooms, two dining areas, one smoking, sitting room for men, men friends where the piano was located. And the adults, men and women were offered drinks before and after dinner. My father had a small factory about 25 people, located about ten blocks from home. He was manufacturing hosiery for men and boys. He would leave early morning, come home for lunch and siesta and return to work around two and stay until six PM. We spoke Serbo- Croatian among ourselves. My parents also spoke Ladino to each other when they did not wanted us children to understand what they were saying to each other.
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: Did you ever learn Ladino? Did you ever later learn to understand?
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   A: Well, I got to understand most of it because of the Italian language and because of the Spanish that a lot of people speak here. So —
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: And your mother stayed at home?
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   A: My mother was at home, yes she stayed at home. She did not work outside the home.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: And were the children schooled at home or did you go to school?
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: We went to school, to public school and after public school we went to Jewish school.
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: So for the religious —
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   A: For the religious yes.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: Instruction. And that was on Saturdays or Sundays? https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   A: What, the religious?
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: It was every day after school.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: And that was it the Jewish community?
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A: No, not really but there was a Jewish center like and that’s where on the way back home from public school, we stopped there and we learned how to read and how to, about the holidays of which I don’t know much today because this whole thing was lost with our immigration.
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: So where did you grandparents live?
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A: Our grandparents, they lived not far from us. And they were pretty religious, especially my grandfather. He was married for the second time. He lost his wife at an early age and my mother took over the family, the upbringing because she was the oldest of the daughters. They had four girls and one boy. So she was in charge of the family.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: And on the paternal side?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: And on the paternal side I never met my grandparents. And I never heard and I never knew much about it.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: But they also lived in Belgrade.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: Possibly. But I didn’t even know that. I know that when we went to Belgrade, much, much later we visited my mother’s mother grave, my grandmother’s grave. And we asked the keeper there, the ground keeper and he took us to the other graves and the resemblance was such that we knew that they were both buried in the same cemetery. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: What happened to your aunts and uncles on the maternal side?
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: They all survived the war. They were in the camps; they were in Italy. And eventually we got all together, much later, as most of them went to Argentina by way of other Montevideo, Uruguay right. And because it wasn’t easy to get into Argentina so they were sort of like to making that like a passage. I don’t know. There probably some, some money was exchanged or what. And that’s where they made their lives. They continued with their lives.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: So you still have family in Argentina?
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: Yes Ido. Have most of them died. I had my grandfather was there with his second wife. My uncle, the one son that they had. And my three aunts were there and of course their families and their children. Now today I have only one, two cousins there. One cousin was a pilot for the Aerolineas Argentinas and he’s retired. Of course we’re talking about many years now. And he has two children and he is a grandpa.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: So this side of the family would have spoken Ladino at home.
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: No. They were all speaking Serbo-Croatian and they learned Spanish. They, first they learned Italian while they were in Italy and then they learned Spanish and they speak fluently Spanish.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Do you remember that you were very small if you were born in 1930, you would have been very small when the war broke out. But do you remember the time before the war. Do you remember, was there anxiety about the war. Was there an awareness of what was going to happen?
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: Not at all, not at all. Until the, there was like a big parade staged by the government. And they had, they had soldiers singing and you know about victory and what not and that they were marching with the cannons that were driven by horses and cows and all that. It was a very https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 primitive. Today it would be laughable. But they felt very strong and mighty. They never suspected that they would be, that you know taken over by anybody.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: And that would have been when, in 41?
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: No this would have been already in 1940. And my mother got very panicky about this whole thing because some rumors. They must have gotten of people being taken out of their homes and to places unknown you know. And she had family. She had cousins all over Yugoslavia. They were not taken from Yugoslavia. The right then and there but she heard rumors and so she took it seriously and she said my children and I are going to my father. He says you settle your business and we are going to, and you will join us. And we started going towards the west, towards west.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Towards the coast?
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Towards the coast.
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: But your parents must have been aware for example of what was happening in 1938 with the annexation of Austria by the German Reich. Was that —
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: It’s possible, yes it’s possible that they knew. Maybe they saw it in the newspaper. Maybe they said oh well it’s not us so it’s whatever you know. And life just went on.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: So when did your mother decide that it was time to leave?
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: In 1940. She picked herself up. We packed up whatever we had and off we went.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Where were you when the war broke out in Yugoslavia?
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: We were away from Belgrade. We were never there when they came to bomb the city. The Germans came unannounced, obviously. That was their way. They never declared war on the https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 country. They just came with the airplanes and they bombed them and then we just had to pick up the pieces. I mean news. Find out who was hit and who wasn’t hit, but we were away.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Do you remember the putsch? Do you remember cause Yugoslavia was first part of the Axis and then there was a putsch and Yugoslavia withdrew its —
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: Was, so you see I still don’t know that, that Yugoslavia was part of the putsch, because Tito was in charge. Oh no, not yet, not yet. That must be 40, it’s all right. They were, I did not know as a child that there was a, not my sister or my brother you know. Neither one of us seemed to be aware of that. We were just following. My mother wanted to go away and so we went with her.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Was the notion that there was a threat to you because you were Jewish or that there was a general threat to people in Yugoslavia?
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: It was mostly a general threat.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Do you know if any other families that also fled at the same time? Was that a communal effort or did you go separately on your own?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: Nobody. They looked at my mother as though she was crazy to leave. And all the way she had family. She had family in Sarajevo and in some other cities, not such a close family. She would stop there and she would tell them that they should leave. They should go. And they said you are crazy. There is no, no need to worry to get panicky about it. And so we went and they did not survive.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: So your mother was primarily afraid of the German invasion from what I understand.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: She was afraid of that, of the bombing and after we heard that they bombed so, so much. Without any declaration of war, war declaration or anything. They just came and they did their job. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: So what did your father do? How did your father react to your mother’s concern?
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: He went along with it. He went along with it. He let go of his factory. His brother was still there.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: What did he do to protect his factory while he would be away?
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: I don’t know. I really don’t know. I know that he tried to get some money so that we would have, we would have some money with us.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: So he tried to sell it?
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Possibly. Or he told his brother to sell it because his brother was not going anyplace and he was married to a Gentile woman and they had a baby. They were afraid. They said how can we go, you know. We had, wouldn’t have milk, wouldn’t have you know a lot of things that today people wouldn’t worry about, they were concerned.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: What happened to them?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: He was killed not her, not the girl.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: And the baby survived too?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: The baby survived til she killed herself years later. Yeah, it was a tragic thing. She didn’t know where she belonged. She didn’t know. Her mother tried to be married and it wasn’t good. She married a drunken guy you know. And my parents stayed in touch with them and told them to sell whatever they found that was — we had nice things at home. We were not that poor, poor you know, we had nice, nice paintings. Nice and they told her she should sell and use the money for her needs. And Melita, that’s the girl’s name. she grew up in that kind of an atmosphere. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 Her, after her mother remarried, didn’t work out and the stepfather was probably not so nice to her and that, that thing broke off. And they survived. They lived til she killed herself.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Which was when?
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: That was when she was already in her 20s.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: So after the war?
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: After the war, yes. In fact she was already married and she had a daughter. Yes, she was married to a Gentile man and eventually that marriage didn’t work out and I think that everybody was messed up by the circumstances. She missed her father terribly and she didn’t know where she belonged, whether she was Jewish or what, you know. And her daughter was very smart and all that. She was in touch with us for quite a while and then she was so self-conscious of her English that she stopped writing us and she could write. She could write and keep in touch. That was Ragena.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Let’s return to your flight from Belgrade. You left when in 1940. In the summer, in the autumn?
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: In the autumn.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: And you were headed west towards any specific place?
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: We were heading towards Dubrovnik.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: What was the plan?
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: We didn’t have a plan. We were just going you know. Wherever the train would take us, they would, we stop, wherever we would be closest to the ships going to Italy. And at the time there was one town there that I don’t even recall the name and from there we encountered the https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 Ustashes, who searched us thoroughly but not that they didn’t search the children. And my mother had made because you know the bank notes, the Yugoslav bank notes were huge. In order to have anything there you had to really hide them somehow. And we had those things on us and so did my brother, my sister. They only searched the grownups and they had nothing on them so they had nothing to take. And they eventually let us go.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: But they were not looking for Jews in —
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: They were. And there they were.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: And your parents had fake papers or —
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: No, no we didn’t have fake papers. I don’t know how did that, maybe they paid off somebody. You know it’s possible but I don’t know. I really don’t know. They kept us from all that kind of -- well I was ten and a half. You know today we tell our kids much more than they used to.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: So where did you stop on the way to Dubrovnik? You stopped in Sarajevo with your family.
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Just passing through, passing through and I don’t know how that was done because we didn’t have a car. We just had to go by train.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: So you traveled all the way from Belgrade to Dubrovnik by train.
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: By train.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: More or less directly.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: And then going back to, through Abatasa. There was a town, Abatasa that comes to mind. And then we went to Italy. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: So Italy was considered safe at the time?
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: Italy was our, you know our next stop. That’s what we felt, we felt that it was safer going in that direction than in the opposite direction so —
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Do you have any ideas why?
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: No that’s a good question. That’s a good question.
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: Was there may be a plan to go to Palestine at all or to go to America?
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: No, no, no, no absolutely not no. Italy was the final destination.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: So how did you get to Italy?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: Well the ship. There was a ship going from the coast, the Dalmatia coast to the, you know the Adriatic. We crossed the Adriatic and we were there and they said what do you expect to, we should do with you. We don’t, we can’t let you in. you’re not —
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: So that was on the Italian side.
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: On the Italian side.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Did you have a visa for Italy?
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: Nothing. We, as far as I know we didn’t have anything. What my mother had I don’t know. Well—and she never, we never spoke about it. We never asked questions unfortunately. And that’s how it was.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: Do you remember the name of the town in Italy where you — https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Yes we stayed in, they eventually brought us to Vicenza. In Vicenza in the Veneto region. We were able to rent an apartment.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: But tell us before how you got into Italy because that’s —
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: That, I don’t even know.
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: You said you didn’t have any visas or possibly not.
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: They let us go. They took, they had my parents sign all kinds of things. They had my parents give up all the money that they had for their safe keeping.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: So that was the Italian authorities when you arrived?
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: The Italian authorities. They were holding, though that money was not stolen from us. It was taken with the idea that we could not be on the government expense but we were just, they would give us what we needed for every day you know. That. And —
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: That was in Vicenza or?
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: That was prior to Vicenza. It was still prior to Vicenza, still on the border line with Fiume [ph] . It was I think few, near Rijeka. That’s what it was.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: So that’s where you went. From Dubrovnik you went to Rijeka.
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: And that’s where you crossed?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: That was the crossing. Yes, that was the crossing. That was the crossing. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: And how did you persuade the Italian authorities to let you in?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: I don’t know. I don’t know whether money did it. Whether, whatever. We were not alone. You know we were a group of maybe 50, 75 people.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: So who were the other people?
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: The other people. Some that we knew, that my parents knew and we didn’t but apparently they were all leaving.
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: But were those other people from Belgrade as well?
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: No. No, no. We found them on the way and they were Jewish. They were all Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: So they came from different parts of Yugoslavia to Dubrovnik.
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: To do the same thing.
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: And took the same boat to Rijeka.
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: To Ryeka. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: So how did you travel then from Rijeka to Vicenza.
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: By train.
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   Q: And you were not under escort. You were —
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   A: Not as far as I know. But — https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: You were not confined or —
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: No, not confined. Not you know not, not treated as prisoners. Absolutely not.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: Did you have to report in Vicenza regularly to the police authorities?
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: No. I think I suspect that maybe my father had to sign something or where we had to report was in Sandrigo. We stayed in Vicenza for maybe less than a year because I know they had a terrible winter that we didn’t experience in Belgrade. We came out with all those things, geloni, what they called geloni. I remember so it had to be winter time. They gave us some, what do you call it cards to buy food.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Ration cards.
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: Like ration cards. Right.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: So you said you rented your own apartment?
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: And where did you stay? Did you rent from a landlord?
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: Right. She was, that was the landlady was there. Her husband was in the war you know. He was a soldier and she was a nice lady. It was a walk up apartment. And we had fun. I tell you the truth. We had fun. I used to go to the marketing such as it was. And my mother on the fourth or fifth floor threw us always a basket down which we filled. She pulled it up and then you know it was a kind of leisurely, leisurely life. The place was enclosed by a big gate. This is what, in Italy they have a lot of, had a lot of such places. In that when you walked in there was a fountain. You know that’s where the people used to get their water. And then it was this long stairway going up. And we brought our water and we did all these things. And she was good to us. And of course she was alone and I guess money was, helped her. This was Senora Marchetti. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: And were there other Jewish families that you knew that stayed in the same area?
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: You were the only one who went to Vicenza?
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: We were the only one as far as I know. I don’t remember anybody else. Eventually when we go back to Sandrigo we were able to find out what happened to some of our others. They were in Ferramonte, which was down south in a camp. But not, it wasn’t a concentration camp. It was just a camp where people were living in little homes like. You know but nothing, nothing horrible. They were just there, detained you know.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: What did you do in Vicenza for almost a year. What did you parents do? What did you udo and your siblings? Did you go to school?
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: No, not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed to go to a movie. All that what it was, but it wasn’t a big hardship. I mean we welcomed the freedom, the kids were, we couldn’t go traveling around but you know we made, we met the people and we made some acquaintances. Not friendships, you couldn’t really.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Did your parents make an effort to learn Italian?
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: Yes, yes and we did too. And I remember that I used to, my favorite word was Capisco, Capisco. I always said Capisco. I could tell them that I did understand what they were saying. You know. I was very proud of learning the new language.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: Were you afraid at all during that time?
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: No. No. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: Were your parents concerned?
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: They were not settled there. They would always tell us you know don’t go there because this is just a temporary thing. Don’t think that this is where we’re staying. This is a temporary thing. Someday we’re going to go home. That’s what they felt, that we, so they tried to keep us, keep a low profile you know until things got resolved. But no big fear of being Jewish. What we did find over there which was very interesting for us was the Ballilla [Fascist Youth].
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: What’s that?
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: Those are the little children are brain washed in uniform, marching for Duce and for you know and they were the fascists. They were taught to become fascists.
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: So where would you see them, in the streets or —
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: In the street, marching and we looked at them and we realized, we asked questions you know. From the — and that’s who they were. And they were different groups. You know. The little ones and they had, you could distinguish them by the color of their uniform or whatever. And that was kind of at the time I didn’t know. You know I mean I took it for what it was. We didn’t have it in Belgrade, obviously. So later on of course you could tell that this is what 1t was. Just a brain washing situation. This is what you get the children. You get —
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: Was there, were there any controls in the street? Were you ever asked to identify yourselves or —
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: No, no, no, that’s why there was —
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: So being Jewish was not a problem? https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011

And I am surprised myself that it was only a year and a half, March being third and the September being nine so that’s six months there. Plus a year. So we were there only a year and a half. And it seemed like such a, because we practically befriended people of the population. I don’t remember anybody else.

There were https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 bedrooms. We shared the bedroom with, as children, we were three in the bedroom. And my parents had another bedroom. And there was a bath. And then downstairs. That was upstairs. And downstairs they had the salotti, you know the, and it was nice. And my mother did all the cooking and all the everything. Eventually she get other woman to help her do the wash. You know they were cooking the water. They were boiling it and what not. Outside there was a lot of, a lot of vegetables were growing outside. But they wasn’t ours. I mean it wasn’t for us. So if she, if the landlady brought us some that was welcome you know but it was there. And we befriended the, a family. Mr. Giovani mentions Antonietta Bozzetto. Well she was older than we were. She was about four or five years older. And she took charge of us because we had to learn everything. How to ride a bicycle, how to smoke a cigarette and we do it. That was my, my sister not but I was the one that went into all of that.

And they blew up the ship and they never told her. So she was waiting for him. My aunt Ella’s husband was taken prisoner and sent to Switzerland and he spent a long time in Switzerland. So she, you know she was pretty much alone with her little boy, who by the way is in Argentina. He is my cousin in Argentina. So these were mostly the people. The rest of the people that I don’t know the people that he mentions except for the Deleon. The Deleon people, they were two young men who took charge of us and they made a school for us. And for their younger brother. So we were in fact when he wrote to me from Australia, he said you remember that we were a school of four. He mentioned the names and I don’t remember him. I remember the, his older brothers you know. It was Elly and what was the other guy’s name, Deleon. Anyway they were https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 all there. They were more even older than my brother you know. And my brother didn’t take any lessons because he considered himself already grown up you know. So it was just for my sister, me, my cousin Anita and their brother. So we were just four kids in that class and we were learning you know the basic things. And they would guide us to books that we should read which was very nice, because we did a lot. I don’t know how we got the books because we were not allowed to go into a library or anything. You know it wasn’t the aim wasn’t to educate us. It was just to keep us there you know until things were resolved.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: So this class was privately organized by Deleon and his brothers.

  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: They were listening. I believe that they must have had the short waves and that they did listen because I know that my brother was glued to the radio. He was six years older than I, so when I, he was 16, 17 you know when I was there. And little by little he got enthused about going to help the partisans over there. And that’s how we lost him.

  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: Right. To Rome we Leno apparently and I, at the time I didn’t even know that he was the one. I thought that my parents bought the false documents when we got to Rome. But it wasn’t that. We, they were, they were smart to send us with that false documents because at that time the Germans were coming already down so they could easily have asked us to see our documents and we could produce first of all the, the names that I don’t even remember the new names that they gave us. But anyway.
  </p>

  <p id="218">
   Q: Did you travel together?
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: No, we traveled separately and we were all going in the same direction to Rome. The reason we wanted Rome was because there was a, oh my god. There was this woman in Sandrigo who had two brothers in Rome. They had sent their families, they were sending their families up north because they were afraid that Rome would be bombed.
  </p>
  <p id="220">

  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Italians. They had a young family. In fact one of them is, of course he’s married. He lives in Milano with his --- I should probably have gotten in touch with him or something. He was the son of our landlord. See there were two brothers. They each took several peoples in their three, four room apartment. And no big, big apartments, but they were willing to do something and they did something for us.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: And their mother was in Sandrigo?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: The mother was on the way up there.
  </p>
  <p id="224">

  <p id="225">
   A: [haven’t met her, I haven’t seen her or nothing, no.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: So she basically sent you, directed you and other Jewish families towards Rome to stay with her son.
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: This woman that sent us down, it was the sister of these two brothers. She was a sister. She wasn’t married or anything. She was a, something in school. And she was the one, she wasn’t married. She was lame. She was you know. She told us. She gave us their address and she told us that they’re going to be at the railroad waiting for us. So we arrived in Rome, after you know, oh the trains were packed with soldiers. They were running away. They were deserting the army because they were no longer allies of the Germans. They were traitors, they’d say you know.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: Were there a lot of refugees as well going southwards.
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: I don’t know, this I don’t know but they were mostly in uniform. And when they would see our group, you know they would get up you know to let us sit down because it was a long trip you know. It wasn’t going very fast. They didn’t have the trains that were going at high speeds. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: When you say your group, aside from your family was that your extended family your aunts and uncles?

   A: Our extended family. I would say.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: And the Deleons as well?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: The Deleons were there also but I don’t know. We lost track of them. In fact we understand that eventually they were taken in by the producer of films. De Sica. The De Sica family. In Rome. At that time they were not famous yet.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: So the group that you are traveling with was just your family?
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: Mostly my mother, my father and my brother and sister and my, my grandpa you know that. And if the others were you know, because you, there was a surge for the railroad. Everybody was in a different place. You didn’t know you hoped that everybody made it and they all made it. We got to Rome and we couldn’t get out of the station because there was the curfew. So everybody’s sitting there on the floor. The kids go to sleep or what, and the Germans are coming in.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: But were those people waiting for you at the station? The two brothers?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: They were outside the station with a car and they couldn’t come in and we couldn’t go out. You know. So it was a, at that point we were a little bit afraid. We didn’t know what was going to happen. You know. But mostly because we knew that somebody was waiting for us. We said oh my god you know everything. But not because of what was going on. You see we were not, we did not get this feeling that, that people were getting killed. That’s what’s so amazing and, and there were concentration camps all around us and we didn’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: And the Germans then checked your papers at the station? https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: Not that I know. They just, they just, they did whatever business they had. They did, they ignored us. I guess we didn’t look important enough or something. You know.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: What did the Italian soldiers do? Were they also waiting at the station? Or did they leave?
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: No, no. they tried, I don’t know but I mean they were on the way down. Not everybody came to Rome, you know. A lot of them got off before you know. They were all running home and I don’t know what they did and how they you know what the, what they had to say to each other, the Germans and the Italians. I’m sure it wasn’t easy, nice. I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: So what happened then, how did you find the people you were supposed to stay with?
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: They found us. They, they saw us. They found us. I guess they decided on some kind of a distinguishing mark or something and they took this one, Doria men, took us to the Flaminia section of Rome and the other his brother, took them. They happened to live. One lived at the entrance of Rome and one at the exit of Rome. So that was just the way it was. And —
  </p>
  <p id="244">
   Q: So was the family separated or —
  </p>
  <p id="245">
   A: Not our family. The we are, excuse me the cousins and all that yes.
  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: Which part of Rome did you stay in?
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: We stayed in the Flaminia part, opposite the Forum Romano where Duce built himself this lavish palace. And we were right there. It was an old building you know with an apartment that was, it was ok. You know I mean it was much better than a lot of people had it, much better ’m sure. And he took the five of us and my grandfather and the second, second wife. Seven and I think that’s all he was able to take. Seven. The other guy took as many. And then the De Sicas took some which I only found out from Giovani. I didn’t know, I didn’t know. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: How was life in Rome? How long did you stay there?
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: Life in Rome was beautiful. You know I, we couldn’t go into any, we couldn’t go into the, we wanted to go see the you know what do you call it where the pope is and then I saw that everything was, well everything was, it wasn’t, 1t wasn’t for us.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Were you not able to see any monuments? Was it —
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: We saw the monuments but you know my parents tried to keep us, most of our day was just gathering the food and gathering the water. There was no water. There was no, no fuel. You know it had to be lines for everything and that’s and we didn’t go to school until the end of the war there.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: So your parents and the three of you were concerned about getting the food and the water and did you stay mostly inside or did you walk around cause it was spring and summer when you —
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: We had to be outside simply to, to get the, the what we needed you know.
  </p>
  <p id="254">
   Q: Was it dangerous to be outside?
  </p>
  <p id="255">
   A: Maybe. We didn’t realize. Maybe it was. Because we had our documents whatever you know they told us that this is well you respond to this name. And that was it. And you know by then we already learned language. We were speaking the language and all but did the Germans know whether the Italian was correct or not. They didn’t. They didn’t care about that. My brother was very, because he was rebellious. He wanted out you know. He wanted, so and he was glued to the radio and listening to that and, and eventually, eventually when all this was, we saw the Germans leave.
  </p>
  <p id="256">
   Q: But when you were in Rome, were the Germans present? Do you remember seeing them?
  </p>
  <p id="257">
   A: They were present. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="258">
   Q: But you were not afraid of them?
  </p>
  <p id="259">
   A: We were not afraid of them because they weren’t, they weren’t doing anything. What they did eventually they, there was an accident in one of the, in the center of the, and our landlord was going home from his job. He was a journalist for the Corriere della Sera [an important newspaper in Italy]. He was coming home and suddenly they threw grenade from the window on a truck with Germans and they did a lot of damage. They killed a lot of people. So the Germans closed the street on both ends. And everybody that was walking there, took them into basement. They beat them up. They interrogated them. And first they pushed them down the stairs. Not letting them even walk properly. And they did a lot of damage to our Doria guy. Yeah the good ones get it you know.
  </p>
  <p id="260">
   Q: Did you know of any Jews being, suffering a horrible fate in Rome at that time, being rounded up or being deported?
  </p>
  <p id="261">
   A: I didn’t know but I know that from the ghetto. Rome had a ghetto that they took them all and they took them to, north, where there was a concentration camp. And from there they put them on trains and they took them to Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: Do you remember this happening while you were there?
  </p>
  <p id="263">
   A: No, no I just, I read that recently. I didn’t even know about it.
  </p>
  <p id="264">
   Q: So tell me about what your brother did.
  </p>
  <p id="265">
   A: My brother eventually when, when the city was free, when the war was over. The, president Roosevelt made an offer that 1000 displaced people are welcome to come to the United States, provided they sign papers that at the end of the war they’re going to go back to their countries. So we figured what the world can we lose. We are just going to do it. We’ll go and my brother was not going to go. Because he had to go back to Yugoslavia. He was not going to face his https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011 friends telling them that he was being, you know sheltered by his parents like a baby. You know he had all these fancy ideas. You know he was young and idealistic and what have you. He was not going to go and we were not going to go without him. So we waited for him to finally he, they spent many, many nights talking and arguing with him and what not and he was decided that he was going to go. In fact he wanted my sister to go because she was, she had learned how to sew. In the meantime in Sandrigo she had learned. And he feel that they will probably be needing that and my mother was absolutely not going to let anybody else go you know. So he went down, he went down to Bari which is all the way down south.
  </p>
  <p id="266">
   Q: And was his plan to go back to Yugoslavia to fight?
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   A: Yeah he was joining the group that was recruiting the young men to go and be in the hills there. You there you know with the partisans. And to fight the Germans because Tito was not in charge yet.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: But you said that was already after the war ended.
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: The war was ended. Italy but the Germans were still in our country.
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   Q: So we’re talking the last few months of the war.
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: Possibly that’s right. That’s right. They were still doing damage to the Germans. They were still doing you know the partisans were always doing something and getting the cars, getting the trains, the bridges, the whatever they were doing and they were, we inquired about him because for a while he was corresponding with us and he would tell us after a while he told us to get in touch with uncle, uncle Bata. Uncle Bata was our uncle in the United States. He made us understand that we should not come back, that we should go because the partisans, while they did a lot of good, they had a Jewish group and they had a non-Jewish group. And they were not really looking very kindly at the Jews. I think that there were books written about that. You probably — so he must have felt some of that, he maybe even tried to make his way back. https://collections.ushmm.org December 11, 2011
  </p>
  <p id="272">
   Q: And that was when he was in Bari and you were still in Rome.
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   A: We were in Rome. From Bari they took a whole group to Yugoslavia.
  </p>
  <p id="274">
   Q: But he was corresponding from Bari? Was he still corresponding from Yugoslavia?
  </p>
  <p id="275">
   A: From Yugoslavia he was corresponding.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   Q: Where was he in Yugoslavia?
  </p>
  <p id="277">
   A: I don’t even know. I think it wasn’t even named. It was all like a secret. I think it was all the way down, yeah that was in Bari and then he was sent to someplace to the mountains and over there when he got there he got the reality of things. And he started telling us to get in touch with uncle such and such without mentioning you know. And then we tried to find, we didn’t hear from him. And we tried to find out where he is. And somebody answers from the authorities in the partisans that he went to, back to his family, to his parents.
  </p>
  <p id="278">

   Q: I just wanted to ask you in the end if you have anything that you would like to add, any thoughts on your story, on your experience.
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: I think that ours was a happy, happy story and happy ending, considering what other people went through. I think we were awfully lucky. And you know the older I get and the more stories I hear from all around of Jews that were in France, or in wherever they went you know it’s just a horror story of more and more you know. And here we, it was just like being on vacation, like a long vacation. Sure we lost, we lost all this time from going to school and so we had to sort of pick up things as we went along. Some things I suppose we picked up and some we never will but school is not only going to the building right. You learn as you meet people and it’s a continuous learning process. I learned a lot from my husband because he really went through the nitty gritty, he went through the whole thing. How he survived that’s a miracle. Because he was in camp from the beginning of the war to the end of the war. He lost his brother. He lost his family, he lost all of them. With the exception of those who, cousins you know he lost everybody. Well Poland was really, he comes from Poland.
