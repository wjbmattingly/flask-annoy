   Answer: I went through my library and selected out of 15 books, two or three which are correct and such as that is, there are two Auschwitz publications, of Auschwitz, has the wrong , So if they had got to swindle or to retouch or to add something to an aerial view, then the whole United States aerial view, aerial view photographs should be now investigated.
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Question: If who swindled?
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   A: There are photographs, you said, taken by the Air Force.
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   Q: Well, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   A: That doesn't look to me like a photograph taken by the Air Force. That is a photo mounting of aerial, of aerial, aerial view of the region and a drawing which was added on top of the, of the map, just for educational purposes.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q: It looks...
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   A: What?
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   Q: Yes, ,
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   A: But I thought you are going to bring me some real aerial. [pause]
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q: Sorry.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   A: I've been moving from barrack to barrack in the whole region, including later on, new zone that was established with the new camp and I had the permission to measure each barrack, each, to take all the measurements because I pretended that I don't, that I want to do that myself because I don't want to use original architectural drawings. Because we were smuggling out plans and if we would have ever caught, then they would have suspected that I have been involved, yeah? So I camouflaged my whole operation by, by, measuring the whole model which I made, measuring barrack by barrack and distances from each barrack and so on. So I had set camp in, still in my head, I can know the numbering system, good or bad, whatever afterwards, I couldn't care less, but I, I produced a camp model and a good one which were sent, taken away and sent first to the, to the headquarters of the SS and then they told me it was to Berlin. And so did all my other, other work of drafts and diagrams went to the ofttimes. But we had no fifth row in the camp flag like produced in all of those drawings. As I have shown you, I have here some publications, with correct, with correct drawings, with correct numbers. Everything else were done and copied by, by a people who were more interested in, in, in, telling their stories than to make a correct, authentic, they are people who could not read a map then and from young people like Kitty Hart(ph), I don't where she learned to read an architectural map or a land drawing or so. And she just copies it and if go further you will find dozens and dozens, many dozens of ____. But how could the Air Force produce aerial views if, of things which did not exist then, I mean that is a very touchy, touchy, situation, don't you think so?
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   Q: Yes, yes. I: Ann and I want to add is that yes, is that she remember that Helen made a map and it was really the big size of this table.

  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Very precise mapping, very good mapping.

  <p id="17">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: All SS men came and they were very delighted of the job. Very good, very impressed.

Hersler(ph) in Bergen-Belsen. [speaks foreign language here]. What I wanted to say is that the, the SS had [speaks foreign language here].

Or in English, so we'll see. We will need somebody who is bi, bi lingual to make sense of us.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   Q: But I think we shouldn't bother with you translating too much. I: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="62">

  </p>
  <p id="66">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: So I said, I still speak Hungarian, it nearly cost my life because I speak Hungarian. [speaks foreign language here]. I volunteered to come this into the block, into the barrack, the Hungarian newcomers there, SS wanted to the ride home. Now this , huh? That's interesting. So , when I went with her [speaks foreign language here], she instructed me what to tell girls. So she said, write home, write to your people and write to them whatever you want, that you are here and you are alive and you are well off. Each helped us, so what I did, I said to the Hungarian girls, "Look, you are told to write to your people but please don't write to the correct addresses of your people because some of them are in hiding or so. Write to the center Jewish office and ask them to forward it to certain people." And the Hungarian girls were mad at me because I told them not to write to their people, but to write through a center office. So they're running to the SS woman and told SS woman that I told them not to write. Now, then what could I do, she nearly, she went mad. She said, "Are you out of your mind?" I said, "No, they did not understood Hungarian." So, but it, it was, it wasn't fun.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   Q: , I: [speaks foreign language here]. The Nazis not believe me, but they believed the SS woman. And [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. That was dangerous.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] asking me, "Are you out of your mind,?" Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]. She was caught in , 9S woman...
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. You will read about her, it's a book, which I with , there is, I made a statement to the author about , but in connection with , not with my own experience.
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah. . [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Do you, would you have some patient, to translate a thin book to your mother, if I make you a present? From English into ?

  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Yeah. [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Now I'm telling her about one situation because she's arrived at the end of '42, but she's did not know prior to that what I have experienced as being amongst the very first women in the camp. And she's interested because the Auschwitz people at the museum, in their whole research and report have very little reports on the day by day happenings during. We have general, general idea, but we don't know individual cases and so my case is a unique one, because as I have been spared by a camp commander of Birkenau, was only for two months, who had a secretary who was [speaks foreign language here]. She had a Jewish boyfriend and for that she was arrested. Now, there is a special, an English expression for , you probably know it, but it turns my tongue around and I have to look that up. In any case, if a Jew and a non- Jew live together, were married together, they were either forced to, to divorce, or if they were unmarried, the man were arrested if he was Jewish and usually killed and the German woman ended up 1n a concentration camp. The insignia of the badges turned into a combined yellow-purple star, yeah and so that commander of the camp, whose name was Miller, he was there only for two months, had a secretary who was one of those Jew lovers and, and she begged for mercy. I, because I was sitting there just to be loaded onto the trucks and while walking she walked from her barrack during lunchtime or so, to her office, which was in front of the entrance of the temp women's camp and I called out to her, "Look, honey, I'm here." And she was running up to her office and all of a sudden, a notorious SS man arrived, his name was Shteebitz(ph), "Where is that inmate so and so?" And then they guided him to me and then he asked me, "What are you doing here?" I said, "I don't know. I want to go back to work." So he said, "Come with me." Took me back to the barrack and asking me to go up and three tier of, three rows of bed which were built, one on top of the others, exactly the one you have at your museum, asking, I had Typhus and I was very sick, asking me to go up and down and up and down and up and down several times. Little he knew that I was trained to, to go up and down mountains and I'm a girl, I could climb and I, I was very weak, but still I, I, I managed. I was used to go up the ladder, by doing murals during my professional career and so on. He didn't know that and I managed nicely up and down as many times as he wanted me to do and then taking me out, asking me to jump over the, the, what was this thing, _, it's a ditch, yeah. There were ditches alongside the center, the central camp road, not like, said, [speaks foreign language here].
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Ah.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here] We are laughing because he, he translated this so funny. And he's a friend of her, so. Of, now what have I, yes, so he took me over to jump over the ditch and off to the...
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Ah, she said that was, that was . [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It was quite, and I could jump, yeah, so I jumped. So I passed my jump, I passed my up and down and then, into the camp infirmary. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. In that office, there was Orly(ph), a German...
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   A: Yes. , Orly(ph). I: Orly(ph) , who was a , no .
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. In any case, there were a lot of girls, German women from the first group that my friend Enna(ph) Weiss(ph) who was then already on the doctor, physician .
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Then there were some employees, some nurses, everybody, yeah and the men in charge, the SS men in charge, Heinry(ph) Schwartz(ph), yeah? And he, he was not happy that the camp leader, sending over who was , to overrule his desire to kill everybody and to gas everybody who is, who was there already waiting to be loaded onto the trucks. And while he, he, and, so he made it his business, he didn't know exactly how, what to do. Hirst(ph) described him as the most reliable SS man in the camp, yeah? So whenever he had an order, he was 100 percent. That's the fax.

But they had to be there before the whole camp was, was alarmed to wake up and before roll call took place. So that was the only disadvantage.

   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: And then she turned, then she became ill.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: But she reported immediately to the hospital, but she was warned don't do it, because if you will do that, you may be subject in selection for .
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. I'm always explaining to people generally, times, [speaks foreign language here]. I always explain that in the beginning, non-Jewish inmates were gassed too. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: But she, as a non-Jewess was three times selected. So when I made the statement to several groups of people or individuals, that non-Jews, Poles and Germans alike were gassed, selected, they were selected and gassed, just like the Jews, people do not believe me, yeah? And here you have a witness, who went through three selections. But then later on, some of the researchers already sometimes it 1s mentioned, but all Jewish people do not want to hear that, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: And it was through out the entire time, or did it become different? I: In the beginning.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   Q: In the beginning, right. I: And later on, I don't know at what occasion, I would say, let's listen to her. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: They stopped approximately in April '43, when the large influx of transports, of Jewish transports arrived from Holland, France, Greece and so on. Then , when they discovered another thing, not , was they discovered then, that the Jewish numbers, the tattooed numbers, [speaks foreign language here], they did not, they couldn't distinguish all of a sudden who is Jewish and who is not Jewish among the women, by selecting and when the, when the switch or the change of policy occurred, the Jews, non-Jews should not be gassed any more, during an in-house selection, because there were no transports coming from outside, where non- Jews were selected like the Jews, but I'm talking about in camp selection, there was, they stopped when the big influx of Jewish people were coming. But then they discovered, all of a sudden that we are carrying the same number, the Jews and non-Jews alike. So how to distinguish during the selections? With a man they could do anything they want as they were marked, but a woman was not circumcised. So they had some big idea we are going to supply, we are going to include a triangle under your number for Jewish women. And then when the triangle, the tattoo triangle was invented. And no one of those big shots who are now in research, engaged in Holocaust and Auschwitz research have the slightest idea why is the triangle is there. Now they started to put the triangle retroactive, but I was hiding. I knew what it meant and I just took, I decided if I can go away without the triangle, I do. And I'm still running around without the triangle of course it could have saved my life once in awhile, yeah, but not always because you were not gassed before your identity not established anyhow. But you know, that ad hoc, ad hoc selection, I escaped many times those things because I had no triangle.
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   Q: So non-Jews, when they were selected, it was only inside the camp, it wasn't on the ramp, it wasn't in coming in. I: Never. Only the transports, let me explain that to her. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Most of the non-Jews were coming from jails, from police stations and then transferred into system of . [speaks foreign language here]. If Jews were coming from a police station, they were entered as or and could not be gassed.
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, I'm just explaining that some difference between newcomers, from jail or or yeah. What the difference was administratively, even if a Jew went from police station in front of a judge, just for not wearing a star or for stealing a or who knows, but he was, he had some guarantee not to be gassed, he could be killed, he could be starved to death, but he was not allowed to be gassed, because he belonged to the same category of criminals, like the non-Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here], the description of certain categories of inmates are described in the secretaries of death, because those women were [speaks foreign language here].
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   Q: When did you meet Tsippy(ph)(ph)? I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. As a newcomer, she had Typhus and [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had what? Why are you laughing? Because no, she had, she felt sick and she was diagnosed as a Typhus candidate. So, girls were standing there naked, it was hot, waiting...
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, waiting for the SS doctor. They had all temperature. If the people were diagnosed as Typhus, patient, they were killed with injections. We had an inmate doctor there, an Slovakian doctor, under the name Anna Weiss(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: Anna Weiss(ph). I: And she took over. As the doctor arrived, she reported not Typhus, but flu, flu, flu, flu. And she was a flu patient all of a sudden and that was the moment she was saved from being killed. So [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="146">

  </p>
  <p id="176">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Doesn't matter what kind, that was no proof that they went to the crematorium, so that can't be why the [speaks foreign language here].
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. That was her only answer when she was asked how do you know that they were gassed? So that they were traveling direction crematortum. That was not a very good of, do you know the Germans were so tricky, the best proof was [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="178">

   Q: Polski, Polski. I: [speaks foreign language here]. I'm going to tell that in English. You know the Germans like to argue with inmates who volunteered as witnesses. How do you know that, how do you know that? So I ask her, "What have you answered and what happened?" She said, "All right, we had our, our paperwork, we had our death certificates and everything went nice, but..." So I said, "But that's not enough. We had cases where people were left, were discharged because there was not enough proof or we couldn't explain it. It is not enough to say that you went direct to crematorium." But those people, who were stating sometimes, who worked in, in the stores, closing stores...
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, closing stores [speaks foreign language here], sometimes recognized the clothing which was returned from the crematorium with a number and when that happened then they, then we had more confidence and proof that the people were not with us any more. And it was still, today you still have to argue with non-believers, with revisionists, even with our own Jewish people. How do you know, how do you know, how do you know? But proof, that wasn't very reliable proof, that when, when the clothing was sorted or cleaned or, or steamed, deloused and some numbers were still on those clothes and the inmates of course, if is an individual, wanted to know if one, if the inmate is still there that just went to the barrack where he used to live, , but it was very complicated, very hard to prove to the world that we know what happened.

Anna said that she exactly remembers the day when she arrived to Auschwitz, it was July 20th in 1943, because the day before it was her birthday, July 21st. I: [speaks foreign language here].

  <p id="387">
   Q: One. I: One. Well, that's good enough.
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   Q: Yeah it was enough. It's enough. I: It's enough. I know. It's enough. I: Going back to the story. I: , I: 20th of July she arrived to Barrack four and she remembers that it was very dirty, full of lice place and they didn't have a floor, the floor was just a mound. Then later on they put the floor and let me think what, what else has been said. Well, the, the... I: We had to sleep in the beginning, outside. I: Yeah and from the beginning they had to sleep outside. I: Outdoors, because they couldn't wait until the barrack was not put into order and cleaned. Because the men were living before us there and that, they were not as good as a woman would have been by keeping the barrack clean. In any case, it was a dirty barrack. Full of all kinds of fleas, bugs. I remember there were rats too, but she does not remember. Rats. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: See how, have used some poisoned gas for the gassing and the, the, for, my God, they are not even using that any more, those things.
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   Q: What, extermination? I: For extermination of the barrack. And so it's couldn't even enter or sleep there because after the extermination, which took place in , It was smelly and we were afraid to sleep indoors because we had the impression that's the same gas they have used for the extermination, but they've used on, on humans, so it took awhile until the whole barrack was allowed, of us, we were able to enter, to breathe, to sleep and to work.
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   Q: So they actually tried to clean the barrack?
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   A: Yeah. Because the neglected the whole thing and the women were afraid to enter.
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   Q: Now were the women actually treating the barracks better than the men? I: Definitely, definitely. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Iam going to translate, but I'm going to historically answer your question, okay? Because it was not 100 percent answer to be what you want it to be. If men were, if a woman was, if our women were better in housekeeping than previously the men, that was your question. Now my answer and her answer combined is that when the barrack was assigned for the administrative, administrative work details, to work and to be housed there, it was very a neglected one, the male prisoners left for the male camp and we were assigned to that barrack, which was Block four, a wooden barrack. So disinfecting took place and then the women organized the barrack to be cleaned, cleaned, , we had enough of water and scrubbing material, all wooden parts, floors, whatever we had were cleaned and was, the barrack was assigned for half of administrative activities, like the camp office, as the private room of the Katya and special room for the drawing office, of which I became part, not part, but in charge. We were administratively part of the camp office adjacent, but they assigned me to a private room where I could prepare my activities and, and work undisturbed. What underlined, which is of importance, and among others, end result of my, of the beginning of my career was that any trait, profession or activity, which had to be performed, like repair of the roof, laying of the floor, of the wooden floor, repairing of any inside work to be done, erecting some walls up between, between the, in the barracks to, to, to have some partitions erected actually, to have an room, you see it was in big hall and then it was divided into certain rooms for certain activities, so the camp office was erected by putting wall and, and, and dividing that into a certain size. Then the private room also, top administrative inmate, like Katya, who was, became the report and another room which I, which was assigned to me where I could work and was called the drawing office. They had neglected the drawing office all the time, I don't know why, I have been known , known as the from the camp office, but I was actually in charge of the drawing office, in addition to, to, to the administrative belonging to the camp office. So drawing office became office of the drawing office. So I was from the [speaks foreign language here]. But, but she, especially on the , certain functions could not be performed by a woman, because we had no know-how, like repairing of the roof, the replacing of broken glasses, putting a new floor, building partitions to, to divide camp, barracks, , designated to us, into a housing or sleeping, sleeping area and another area, so there we had the first time, certain male work details who were coming from the mens camp to perform those activities. And what I just want to add to it, that because of that, the policy was, if there's a woman who can perform anything a man would have had to do, a man was, if there was a capable woman, able to perform those that did it as they preferred, a woman, because they wanted to avoid the, the contact between men and women and that was always an opportunity to exchange certain views, to spread certain news, or words or whatever. And if that wouldn't have been the policy, I would have never obtained my drawing office, never have been put in charge of the drawing office, where I could practice whatever I have been trained for, that means graphics, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. I have been just explaining what I said, what I've been adding to her previous statement and made my remarks that while reading, while counting the kind of professions, which women could not perform and therefore we had to engage male prisoners, well, in addition she added painters. So I said but we had painters only later and they have been always looking for painters in the , but in those days we had no painters, no.
  </p>
  <p id="396">

   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Look, there is an existing, an existing standardized, existing standardized layout for a concentration camp indoor, indoor establishment and, and so, so, it isn't standardized policy, we need where we need that, we need that. Only the size had to be decided. The, the [speaks foreign language here]

  <p id="434">
   Q: But the men's office had no drawing office, yes? I: No, never.
  </p>
  <p id="435">
   Q: So how, how come? How come you, the women had one? I: Because we were adding a room, that's all. Yeah. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="436">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: It's the right person, it's the right time that you add. I: She said that was something that the reason that the men didn't have the drawing room, there was something really new and really unusual that women in this barracks had a drawing room and then because of Tsippy(ph)'s(ph) talent, she was a very talented drawer and, and, and graphic designer, so that was the reason why they opened a drawing room in, in the Barrack four.
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: was organized because of Tsippy(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: That room was organized because of Tsippy(ph)? I: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   Q: But do you understand, I don't, I don't want to belabor the point, but do you understand my question? If Katya comes in to Anna's barrack, now I don't know how you got into it, so just, one, one moment Tip, and she says she wants to reorganize.
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   Q: What, what is she reorganizing? If, if the organization... I: , the camp. Reorganize the camp.

  <p id="443">
   A: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: So she wants to change the...
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She had no intention to change, because she couldn't, change the system, but she wanted to exchange the personnel in charge of the inmates to be able to conduct a more efficient organization , but to, to obtain an out, an better out, yeah, so she switched from one inmate in charge to a better one. She was a very efficient person, a very success oriented person and all of a sudden she had here on one hand, a primitive prostitute from Ravensbruck in charge of the Polish women who were wives of officers of and, and, and the high ex-Polish officials, where the balance was impossible, I mean you can imagine how primitive Slovakian girl, even from village with a highly trained Polish intellectual, she could not deal, she only could be rough and was not able to perform anything of what was asked her to do, not even a list of an inmate because they could hardly write. So he or she matched the inmate population of one barrack to the people in charge, who will, were, will be able to conduct exactly what she needed to bring her system or the system in which, which was created by the Germans in a certain way, to satisfy the Germans but not to serve the Germans, to satisfy the Germans and to help us. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Now you understand.

   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. What 1s, what was the question, what's the answer? We had a private discussion.
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. She mentions the word political , so I said, I added, [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. Yeah, no I explained to her that I am taking the liberty to add and to clarify certain things which 50 historians, no 100 historians in 50 years were not able to do. We can solve that by adding the wording and explaining the difference, exactly how it is, how it was and how people may, will be able to understand. And she mentioned [speaks foreign language here]. I added to it, registration. Because the [speaks foreign language here] meant Gestapo and we were not Gestapo, but they, they had the [speaks foreign language here] Gestapo in the [speaks foreign language here]. And that is something not you understood before and not, understood or explained before, not the Auschwitz museum ever printed the [speaks foreign language here], that's all.
  </p>
  <p id="454">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Correct. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Bravo. [speaks foreign language here]. Did you understood? I said we make history right now.
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: That part I understood. I: By bringing something to the attention for the first time, the difference which was never understood, never told and never even take... People could care less because so what? [speaks foreign language here]. SS, SS, what's the difference, yeah? And that's why we are where we are, ina vacuum. No, I will not talk any more. I said enough.

   Q: No, not... I: ...that I explained to her. I also told you that we may create opposition .
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   Q: That I understand, but you... I: Then I told her the same thing, then I told her we may, we now have reached the point where we were able to compare and to explain and feel that isn't, that is an was an very important morning and she agreed.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: But did you, you... I: What?
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   Q: There are two different offices? I: There are two different systems.

  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Auschwitz was a central administrative ;

   A: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   Q: That served the SS and the camp office served the inmates, but the camp office also had Drexel(ph) and Mandell(ph), who are Germans, who are SS, yes? I: Every work detail, every barrack, had an SS man in the camp, in charge, who signed for anything. That means we served the camp office, the function of the camp office was logistic supply of everything, organizing the camp for our betterment, we tried to, but the SS had in mind, first of all the SS had, that was a network. We had blocks, barracks, we had work details. Inside work details, outside work details and for each inmate in charge, there was an SS man who was not a very high, high ranking SS man, justa puppetto _..
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: For every, for every... I: Function. For every...
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   Q: For every function? I: Yeah.

  <p id="478">
   Q: SS men or SS women, or? I: And/or, and/or. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: To serve the inmates, yeah, was a function to serve the camp. Each function had an SS man in charge, who was more or less on a rubber stamp, yeah? [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: We were in charge, in the camp, to serve the inmates, assigned by the system, an SS personal member to give the rubber stamp, yeah. That was all, we had nothing but [speaks foreign language here]. Every employee of the SS was a Gestapo and the inmates who worked there worked for this Gestapo man. We did not work for any Gestapo man in the camp. Is that clear?
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   Q: Yes, that part is clear, but you understand that if someone's listening to this organization... I: ,
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: To explain, no, I under... I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: But what I'm trying...
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She 1s just trying to say, not to misunderstand that the women who were working and living in the , yeah, were not, were not collaborators.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   A: No, not collaborators. I: Yeah? Correct?
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: Mm-hm. I: You had certain...
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, correct, they are not collaborators. So that you have to draw the line somewhere, they were forced [speaks foreign language here]. You see the difference was, once you were serving the SS in the of the Gestapo, you could not get out of it, you could never resign. You can, you could refuse in the camp by saying, oh I am not capable to do it, let somebody else do it. So she went to Katya...
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here], they have all... [end of side one, tape 3]
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. He described very in detail, the camp organization, but again from the point of the male. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: So the women's organizational structure was never really taken very serious, in spite of the fact that the women's lager(ph) was in a huge camp, if it comes to, to numbers of inmates. So as well, the women's structure they didn't know, they couldn't care less. Nobody who visited us in the camp office from the main prisoners had an idea what we are doing, how we are function. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. There were more women in the than men. So those four, five Polish prisoners who worked there, they are known, they were giving their testimonies, but they still, the people, the secretaries of top management did, did not know what we are doing, they didn't know about our function. The SS secretary from, from [speaks foreign language here]

  <p id="493">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Did, did you know, if the men didn't know the organization of the women's camp, did you know the way in which the men were organized? I: Yes. Exactly like us, only we were perfect and they were, they were, they had difficulties [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: She said that you can ask any question you want to ask, because she's .
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: Did you know about the way the men organized their camp office? I: She didn't know much about the office at all. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: About our lives, the men and, and, and from and men and women, they know about each other lives because they were sending secrets letters, there was only the road which divided the men camp from the women camp and the, of course there were families, so the husband was in the men camp and the wife in , so that the letters and they, sometimes they talk through the wires, SO was a certain way of sending information about the camps
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   A: Birkenau, Birkenau, [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   Q: Did you have meetings in Block four about the organization, about how things were working, I mean how was there communication inside the block about the, since this was the, this is the organization of the camp prisoners, did they have meetings so that they made decisions together, how?
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: I bring you something to .
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   Q: But, but come back Tsippy(ph). I: I bring a bottle glasses.

  <p id="502">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Can you, yeah, can you be more clear? So you want to know about the...
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   Q: Well in all organizations, when people have different functions, they have meetings. Now if, in spite of the fact that this is an extermination camp and a concentration camp, they had functions to perform, did they have meetings where they discussed problems, where they had to make decisions or did Mandell(ph) and Drexel(ph) simply say, or Katya, you do this, you do this. I'm just wondering if there's a certain... I: We don't know that.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: We don't... I: The SS had no sessions 1n front of us.
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   Q: Well then did you as prisoners have meetings? I: No. You received orders. I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: No, no, no.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: No, no, no, that's not what I meant Tsippy(ph), I didn't mean, I meant was there any, how was decision making, I didn't...
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: Wait, wait, one at a time. I: I know what you mean, you compare with civilian, normal civilian procedure, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   Q: Well no, I'm not comparing it, I'm asking if there's any comparison. I: No, no, no. See [speaks foreign language here]. What is an environment in Deutsch?
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: In Deutsch, I... I: What's an environment? [speaks foreign language here]. No. military environment, yeah? Military? I: [speaks foreign language here] I: Yeah, the whole system, the SS system, wait a minute, the SS system...
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: But you... I: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   Q: But you, you understand, when you, when you say that, you were working for the prisoners? I: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: Right? I: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   Q: And if Katya... I: Theoretically, theoretically.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: No theoretically understand, the larger structure is an SS structure, it's the German structure, it's not your structure. I: No.
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   Q: You are working within a structure to try and make things work more efficiently, you're trying to help people in that structure. I: We're trying to help them, the SS...
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: So that... I: But with the, with, with the purpose in mind to help .
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   Q: So you're trying to satisfy the SS, while you are at the same time trying to help the prisoners? I: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: So, right. I: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   Q: Okay. I: [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="524">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Correct. I: Any, any made by SS, they are trying to figure out how they can avoid it and their way can help inmates, to, to, to help them. [speaks foreign language here] I: [speaks foreign language here]. You want me to translate? I: Yes, because you speak also German and sometimes I don't follow the story, so you... I: Yeah, I have been under the impression that I am talking too much, so I don't...
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   Q: No, it doesn't, no, no, it doesn't, it doesn't, 1t doesn't matter. What we're trying to do 1s get at the information here. I: So, so the answer of hers is the same . We tried to figure out how to make the appearance that we follow the instructions, but our main purpose, most of our women who were assigned by Katya, our main purpose was to serve our people, yeah? To serve our inmates. We had individuals who were not intelligent enough to, to follow that kind of the line. We had inmates who took orders and behaved cruel, without any thinking, they were just like, like reflex animals, yeah. We had a beautiful woman who turned out to be stupid enough to become too, be cruel and then she had to pay with her life for it. [speaks foreign language here]. Nobody forced you to be cruel. They expected you to be cruel, but you could always behave like a human being. And if somebody was not willing to do so, paid for that later on, after the war, yeah? We had many cruel people, behaved cruel, but they could have behaved just normal, like any normal human being, we had normal, good people. So here you are, the system was established and , it depended on the inmate in charge how to, how to exercise her power and her position, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: If there was an SS around... I: No, not always.
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   Q: No, no, I said if. If there was an SS around... I: Then there be...
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   Q: And the expectation was that they would be cruel... I: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   Q: Would a person usually then be cruel? I: No. If an SS was around, they were screaming, they were hitting, but afterwards they apologized to the inmate, we had to do it, yeah and just to give the impression and to impress the SS. But they never meant [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: Good. I am glad it's been so [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="531">

  <p id="603">
   Q: The plans that went from Auschwitz to . What is, what is going on, why are they, they sending plans for what purpose? I: Because they wanted to know, they wanted them to know...
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   Q: What was going to happen? I: When they arrive, to know where they are going or what is going to happen, because they thought if they are going to be carried straight away to the gas chamber and they will know about it, that a mass of people, they will be able to revolt, yeah? Or to resist.
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   Q: To whom did they send these, do you know? I: To, to to certain people in Theresienstadt.
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   Q: It was contacts that they had? I: Of course, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   Q: And how would, do you know how these were sent? I: Wait until she comes because there was Tosha(ph) involved. You see that was , 1, I, I played an very important part, see I never spoke about it, but if you want to know I may mention something and I wanted to speak yesterday to , but she, there was no, I'm afraid she's not alive because since two weeks I'm trying to contact her and just a constant busy sign. Finally I asked the operator yesterday to, there was only, the telephone, busy sign, but no conversation, so.
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   Q: All right, let's wait til Anna comes back. I: Never made it my business to, look I cannot fight, on how many fronts shall I fight?
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   Q: Tsippy(ph), I'm not arguing with you. I: I know, I'm just asking, I'm asking myself, on how many fronts can I fight? I have been fighting with, fighting, I mean fighting, all right? Since the Auschwitz exhibit at the UN, arguing about the, about the correctness, that's better, yeah, of the insignias, which was, they were wrongly interpreted, the Washington Holocaust office, the Washington Museum produced wrong information, the Auschwitz people in the, what's the museum in Auschwitz? Produced wrong information, cause they engaged in so-called consultants, a famous from Auschwitz, who didn't know the difference between an, an, Jehovah Witness and an Jewish and a non-Jewish person who had a love affair with a Jewish man, they were differently marked, the women's camp had their own, yeah and I will probably sit down with you and explain to you my activities and my functions and my work in the drawing office. And then you will understand why I'm objecting to the insignias, why I'm objecting to other things, to, to the plans of Birkenau in general. I have never disclosed to anybody because I've never been asked, never been understood what I did because to be, to have, I mean the historians don't even know how to read a map, to be quite honest, they don't look for the, for any clues which could be misleading. They are looking things from an entire different angle and I cannot blame them. But if there comes some graphic artist, who, who was trained and worked all her life in the profession and is trying to argue about something of, of a graphic nature with an historian, it is an tragedy, yeah? Because I had cases where, was mentioned yesterday, I had to explain what a stencil 1s, yeah? By explaining what I designed for a particular, in a particular situation. So I'm fighting against many thing, it's not fighting, I'm just arguing about it and I always, I never had a real sympathetic ear by anybody to listen to me and it's, I've developed a situation where I suffer from an certain kind of loneliness, I cannot talk always to myself. People don't know what I'm talking about. I'm not quoted in any world famous historical literature because I've been living a world of silence due to my handicap, where I couldn't hear, where I couldn't communicate and when I finally opened my mouth it was, I was totally isolated, misunderstood and too technical for their taste. No, now you know. Now let's come back to the aerial views. The aerial views as we've discovered is that they were, I mean for the purpose of explanation and important that they have inserted the plans and, and brought out the area they were, the area in question, but why couldn't they do the right thing, why have they used and copied the wrong thing, that is my, I am had no, no objections that they have inserted the camp, the women's camp on their aerial views. I've given strong signal, yeah? Can I call that...
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   Q: You mean, you mean with a diagram as opposed to a photograph?
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   A: With a diagram, correct. But then they had not and you cannot even blame the people what they did because from the first day on, the very first publications after World War 2, produced in Poland, by famous researchers like Dr. for example, he published the very first book on Auschwitz and it's a good one, I have that in both languages, in German and 1n, in, in Polish, which he forwarded to me because I, that's always active and tried to keep in touch with the post-war Auschwitz family of inmates, I mean, it's not the families, but we got a small family of people who tried to stay in touch with. That was in Warsaw in headquarters of the international Auschwitz committee, under the stewardship of ____. And then there was the museum and there are people who tried to do their best but the world was not very sympathetic, they had no money, they had no, they were not very, we were not very popular because the world had enough in those days, so there was a Stagnation of interest and after awhile people started to publish correct or incorrect. But then it comes to diagrams and to the drawings of the camp, there were irregularities, they were using some, they couldn't, tools, all those by foot, they had no experts to perform, they, to perform a layout of the measurement instruments, they had no access to the camp building office, they didn't even know then that it ever existed. People, the historians who were trying to start to bring the history down to paper, had no idea that there was an Auschwitz official building office and so that those, that, maps and drawings and sketches were preserved miraculously, yeah. We know today how the camp looked, we know and, but somebody was, sit down and complain. So the first plan was used, the first basic information was used from , that document of, the Berlin planning of Auschwitz. I mean they tried and they still have enough of material and they had enough of material, but it was wrongly interpreted because the draftsman who was able to read the drawings, was not reading the historical background, yeah? If they would have done what I did all my life before I had to perform a drawing for my husband for his publication, I first had to learn the text and to translate his scientific language into simple lines and diagrams. The people who were assigned to make the sketches of the first sketches after the war, were not presented with an historic background, they're not even asked to read or to understand what they are drawing, what they are doing and so we have know the after effects.

  <p id="612">
   Q: Tsippy(ph) where was the, where were the, the building plans office? In the men's camp or in the women's camp? I: No, you can spot that in one of the aerial views or you have to [speaks foreign language here]. You know, we have now the same...

The political situation, how to camouflage things, how to pretend, how to lure the people into be able to be driven into the gas chamber without any resistance. So we were, nobody was sure the Germans in Auschwitz had no idea when, when and what order will come from Berlin, huh? I: [speaks foreign language here]

What ts the relationship of the men's camp to those camps and what's the relationship of the women's camp? Because all the rest of the camp 1s divided by sex, pretty much. I: Okay, only, only the role call.

  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: [speaks foreign language here] I: The tragedy was that they made no use, during a war, where manpower or womenpower was short to use the young family members, men and women for something productive, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: You mean the Germans didn't use any? I: No.

And that what the Germans tried to do, but what you don't know is and you have not reported and never mentioned, [speaks foreign language here]. Katya overheard once in an telephone conversation, while she was on her own, it is actually, but I'm not [speaks foreign language here], I wouldn't like to talk about it because it's very, very described what I have to say about Katya in one of the books of wrote in his last years. [speaks foreign language here], so let's bypass Katya, we are now back to Theresienstadt, yeah. The Theresienstadt from the [speaks foreign language here]. You see we, we received the, the lists of death simultaneously, simultaneously [speaks foreign language here], so they, when they were gassed in the night [speaks foreign language here] and they were gassed, next morning, next moming, we already had the list of death and we had to administer that and, and absorb [speaks foreign language here], I was so [speaks foreign language here], with my head [speaks foreign language here]. So I'm tell you, we knew in the morning, they were taken at night, they were gassed.
