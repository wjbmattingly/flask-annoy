  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: So, he was hired out?
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   A: And the mut — and mother used to miss him so much, that he — she used to come to visit him. When she did not show up, she used to watch him from the woods when — the edge of the woods, that — so that she could see him, but he could not see hi — her.
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: Okay.

  <p id="173">
   A: To — you know, yeah, to — to break his heart, so to speak. June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: So you grew up with this kind of story, her — his mother tells your mother, and it becomes known to you, about this —
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   A: Yeah — no, farmers talk to each other —
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="178">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="179">
   A: The village where — where I grew up until age of seven, eight, was — all the 20 families were — were together. They were not dispersed like later it happened in ’27, 28.
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: I remember reading that you said that was a great tragedy for the village.

So it was part of the whole circle, and you have the idea, also. And we — we — and then we sang together, we — later, you could hear somewhere, somebody sing June 29, 2018 [indecipherable]. But we did not — when they dis-dispersed the families into settlements, it was a completely different situation.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Well, from what I understand from the history, it was that there was a land reform act.
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: Yeah, this is — oh, look at the Danish people, look at the German, you see they do very well, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: On single farm — single family farms.
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: Yeah, yeah, that was the motivation.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: And what you’re describing is much more the Russian mir system, where — where villages were collected in one place. That is, they lived in one place.
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: They — they were not collected. They original, they grew from there, and the one, and then the neighbor, ah, I like you, I will be here, also, I will, I will ma —

  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: — but the land was somewhere else. The land was not —

  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Tell me —
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Later they joined, they said, okay, let’s have each one of us should ha — have all our, you know, little — those places, in one place.

  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: He was — you see, it’s here we — where I do not know the details, because many things during that period, were very, very, very secretive.

  <p id="715">
   A: Sure, when I’m talking about, you know now, around the questions here, and I’m sort of trying to get to it. You see, intuitively, and as a poet, and who sort of was there, and some of it I remember like un-directly, and un-directly, I know that I’m right, but I cannot feel — put my — you know, fingers on — on — on — on — on facts, on specifics, that I’m no — I know that I’m right un-direct, about the feelings of the people there. I know — remember very clearly, you know, sort of, you know, what I https://collections.ushmm.org June 29, 2018 heard — some glimpses out there, and I don’t need everything literally, from A to Z to make my — my — my observations, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: I understand that. I understand that. It is — excuse us — okay. There are — I’m going to talk now, more than I usually do, but it will be in two parts. One, in trying to say back to you what I think I understood. Second, about the purpose of interviews like this, and the whole idea of oral histories. When — when we — when we conduct them, the strengths of oral histories are exactly what you say, you know you’re right. It is in the impressions, it is in the experiences, it is in the memories.
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: The danger is always to have — make it too narrow, too restricted. Permit a lit — me to open that’s there, and —
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: Yeah.

  <p id="719">
   A: — which sometimes, on direct memories observations, are more truthful than — than factual sometimes, factual.

  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="722">
   Q: That — but in the — in the purpose of what we’re doing here, is we’re trying to establish an historical record, through the memories of people, decades after the events happened. And — and that’s why, in some ways, it is a counter kind of purpose. And, I would say, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="723">
   A: Why? June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   Q: — forgive me for that. Because as much as possible, I need to anchor things in context, in dates, in understanding. So I think — a-and I think it —
  </p>
  <p id="725">
   A: But that’s what you are getting.
  </p>
  <p id="726">
   Q: I know. But here’s the thing. What you are telling me, makes sense to me. But that is because I know of a lot of the history that people who will be looking at this interview, may not. So that’s why I want to repeat it back, and see if I have understood it properly, so that someone else can understand it properly.
  </p>
  <p id="727">
   A: Yeah, do it.
  </p>
  <p id="728">
   Q: Okay. So, here’s what I’m under — here’s the impression I’m getting, 1s that at some point in 1936, or 1937, because that’s the time of the Spanish Civil War, and it is a topic that is discussed, you remember being in your bed area, you know, the — separate from the living room, and lying and hearing — lying down in your bed, and hearing others in your family, behind the curtains, talking about politics.

  <p id="729">
   A: Not o-others, only one: Povilas and his invited friends.

   Q: So you — for example, at that time, you’re about 14 years old. Your brother is already a young man, he’s around 23 - 24 years old. And he invites his friends over, and they’re talking about the Spanish Civil War, and they’re talking about social democracy of a certain kind, and in the end, they sing “The Internationale,” in Lithuanian. And then you remember, but you didn’t know this at the time, but you remember at some point in later years, hearing that when Justas Paleckis, who is someone most American or English speaking people would not know about, but Justas Paleckis was a leftist writer, who, when the Soviets came into the country, became the president, quote, unquote. I don’t remember his exact title, but Snie¢kus was the first party secretary, Paleckis was the president, and under his signature, a lot of people get sent to Siberia, both then, and later. And what you are saying is that you intuit that your brother was somehow or other, a trusted person, because Paleckis —

  </p>
  <p id="753">
   A: I don’t know what that discussion was, but I understood that I do not remember my brother’s voice. But I think was to the — in some way, he was consulting him, should I take it, or not, trying to make up his mind. And I have no idea what myJune 29, 2018 brother told him.

   A: Or they were maybe involved — oh yes, now I remember that that week, on the branches of the trees by the road, by the cemeteries, and the cemeteries were by our house, there were some leaflets attached again, political leaflets. I have no idea what they promoted. And it was next day after that, that I had to stop at their house in Kubeliai — Kubeliai for something, and the police was — and I saw that, you know, everything was — was in a mess. The police was there. They probably suspected that they produced those leaflets and hung them there.
  </p>
  <p id="802">
   Q: Were they known to have a particular political view?
  </p>
  <p id="803">
   A: N-N — people maybe knew. I had no idea.

  <p id="804">
   Q: So, it could have been they were very leftist.
  </p>
  <p id="805">

  <p id="807">
   A: I-I was not in that age, and I was still in my shell.
  </p>
  <p id="808">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="809">
   A: But those were glimpses into the real world, which I remember very well, that there were people who were doing something, I don’t know wh-why, and what — for June 29, 2018 what reasons, and what is said, what was in those leaflets. Because police came, people said, oh don’t touch them. Let the police do — come, and took, so I had no — had no idea what was in those leaflets.

   A: I want to interrupt one more.
  </p>
  <p id="818">
   Q: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   A: Same as later, when the Germans, same as Soviets, they did not come blindly, with no preparations. They had already people watching for years, probably, and some of them were connected, preparing, you know, here and there and there. Like Germans had same. Some of them — some of those people maybe were, you know — I don’t kn-know. But none of those occupiers came with, like they do now, sometimes they just go to another country, with — I think they had planted people. I’m thinking that now. June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   Q: Yeah. Yeah. So, let’s come to 1939. Do you remember whether there was any reaction in SemeniSkiai, or Birzai, or Papilys, about the German attack on Poland, September first?
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   A: There were two reactions. The dominant reaction was ah, we have Vilnius now back.
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   Q: Because of the controversy with Poland on Vilnius.
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   A: Yes, yes. Vilnius was the center — there was produced happiness. The — the Poles were the most hated nation in the world, for Lithuanians.
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: Why?
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: Why? The —
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: For — we have five —

  <p id="829">
   A: No. Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   A: No, no, they were — they’re more Pilsudskis, and all those — those guys, they — they were all most hated people.
  </p>
  <p id="832">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   A: So th — there was elation when the — the Russians decided to — to — to [indecipherable] eventually put — attach — to reattach Vilnius to Lithuania. So for June 29, 2018 some time, that, almost like sort of — that elation, almost to cancel all the bad things for e — for — at least for a moment, until they began to think, you know, and see, oh, they’re bad, bad [indecipherable]. They are the [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="834">
   Q: So you said there was another. There was — there were two reactions. One was nice —
  </p>
  <p id="835">
   A: Oh, the other reaction that says oh, now — now — now, we may have another war. We are having another war, and — and — and —
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   Q: So people started talking about that?
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   A: Yes, yes, they did — I — I don’t remember [indecipherable] but I — I — I cannot con — yes, every family already knew that this is bad.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   A: That this is bad.
  </p>
  <p id="840">
   Q: Okay. Now, was the — when you mention that — that Russia attached Vilnius back to Lithuania, why would Russia do —
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   A: I don’t know really, again my mem — see, I am very bad at dates — at which point that became real, because first the — okay, Germany, and the — they met — they made a deal with Russians, and they wanted, sort of, Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="842">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="843">
   A: But at which point — and then Russians march into Lithuania only in 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   Q: Thirty-nine.June 29, 2018

  <p id="845">

  </p>
  <p id="848">
   Q: What — what the — what the — the factual reference —
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   A: All I remember boy — being in Papilys in sixth grade, in the bench, sitting there in the middle of the class, and the teacher — somebody comes in and take the teacher out, and then the teacher returns, and asks everybody to listen carefully, and tells that the war started, and that — and the Soviets — that the message was given to the teacher, and that was the situation. So — and so that — that’s how we found out what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   Q: Okay. The background to this, from what I — from what I have read, is that that Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in August, 1939 — August 23", and one week later, September first, is when Hitler attacks Poland. And sometime in the fall, I believe it was October, I could be wrong, the Soviets start marching in, and that 1— then — start marching in, but do not take over the country until 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   Q: Okay. So, during that — those several months, did you continue going to school, did you —

  <p id="855">
   A: No, no, no, I was in this — sixth gr — sixth — fifth — sixth grade in Papilys. I was in Papilys.
  </p>
  <p id="856">
   Q: Okay, you were still in sixth grade —
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   A: I—I went — began going to school very late, because I was needed on the farm. And then, after the fourth grade, I skip one year again, before going to the fifth grade. So there were many — I was not — the family was not even sure if I will, you know, ever go to high school or gymnasium.
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   Q: Okay, okay, okay. That — that — that makes sense.
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: Because first I was still very — I was not in the best of — my weakness body remained for a good — until I was fif— di— 16.
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="861">
   A: That’s all. And I did not talk to anybody, I was always [indecipherable]. I did not communicate with anybody.

  <p id="866">
   Q: And then —
  </p>
  <p id="867">
   A: And I remained in the — in the shell, I mean, to — today, I’m in a shell.
  </p>
  <p id="868">
   Q: What are your first memories of life changing, when the Soviets appeared in Lithuania’? What are your first memories of that?
  </p>
  <p id="869">
   A: Fear was — you began to feel — I mean, feel fear. You could feel it floating over, like everybody — like how it manifested, that fear, I cannot describe now. But you could feel it, and see it in the — in the — almost in the physical movements, in the faces, and how — in the relationship. And silences here, and — creep in, and — and then you — we immediately began hearing about neighbors being arrested there. It wa — it started before the mass deportations, even those small deportations and arrests —
  </p>
  <p id="870">

   Q: Did your schoolteachers change?
  </p>
  <p id="879">
   A: Yes, the atmosphere felt like — like — like the de — joyful hap — sort of blissful, careless atmosphere [indecipherable] like some cloud began descending.
  </p>
  <p id="880">
   Q: Did that mean that the teacher who might have formerly been a friendly teacher, now became more closed, or did it mean it was a new teacher?
  </p>
  <p id="881">
   A: No, they were the same, but you could almost feel, you know, a certain kind of seriousness, a different kind of — it changed da — through the village, it’s — I mean, 1- i-it’s difficult to describe how a system, repressive system like that, and especially when you begin to see the actual, real results can begin to affect the whole — th-the — and like produces kind of invisible atmosphere there, that is there. You cannot describe it, but you — you — you feel it’s there.

  <p id="882">
   Q: Let’s cut for a second. [break] Okay.

  </p>
  <p id="923">
   A: No, no, in Birzai.
  </p>
  <p id="924">
   Q: Oh, so he had become a pastor in Birzai now.

  <p id="925">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="926">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="927">
   A: Yes. He was never in Papilys.
  </p>
  <p id="928">
   Q: I thought that’s where your parents went to church, and that he was the pastor there.
  </p>
  <p id="929">
   A: Yeah, but the pas — you go — you don’t have to go to your pastor’s church.
  </p>
  <p id="930">
   Q: Got it.
  </p>
  <p id="931">
   A: You can go to —

  <p id="935">
   A: Or any Catholic church.
  </p>
  <p id="936">
   Q: Okay, got it. I— I misunderstood.
  </p>
  <p id="937">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="938">
   Q: Yeah. So, this is when you actually moved to the city, the local city, Birzai?
  </p>
  <p id="939">
   A: Yes, for tha — yeah, for the winter.
  </p>
  <p id="940">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="941">
   A: And then —June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="942">
   Q: Now, the bagel shop — excuse me now.
  </p>
  <p id="943">
   A: Ye-Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="944">
   Q: The bagel shop, was that in a Jewish neighborhood? Was there a Jewish neighborhood?
  </p>
  <p id="945">
   A: I do not — I— there must be clattered in the different areas of Birzai. I — I only remember that there was — you know, I know there was a — not mok — what do you call that, mosque —
  </p>
  <p id="946">
   Q: The synagogue.
  </p>
  <p id="947">
   A: Synagogue. I don’t remember any specific Jewish area, but there must have been.
  </p>
  <p id="948">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="949">
   A: Because even in Birzai, when I moved, I was as — as you can see, I did not have time to walk around, and know the city. To skip si — you know, six classes, imagine — five —
  </p>
  <p id="950">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="951">
   A: And even later, I was not that — I was — I still remained a book person. I did not — I —I did not famil — now I regret it, I did not vo — familiarize more with the city. But
  </p>
  <p id="952">
   Q: But you — in other words, you didn’t really know whether or not it was neighborhood that was predominantly Jewish, or not. It was just a neighborhood. June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="953">
   A: No, you could see them there and there and there, different stores, scattered through the whole city. I did not — tell you the truth, I did not know the — did not — was not aware.
  </p>
  <p id="954">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="955">
   A: Even th — maybe there was, but I was not aware. I under-derstood that they were every — you know, scattered.
  </p>
  <p id="956">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="957">
   A: Through the all, sort of — there was some bur — suburban par-parts, where there were no Jews, but in the center, they were ev — you know, there and there and there and there.
  </p>
  <p id="958">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="959">
   A: And I did not even — could not even tell how many, you know? I figure that there must be, in a city of 5,000, which I was told by the mayor of BirZai later, in Brooklyn — he had the [indecipherable] in Brooklyn.
  </p>
  <p id="960">
   Q: Oh, he also went — he — he was also an — a refugee, in Brooklyn?
  </p>
  <p id="961">
   A: Yes. Kulibis(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="962">
   Q: Kulibis(ph), okay.
  </p>
  <p id="963">
   A: Ye-Yeah, that — there were five — at that point was five. He would have known the — how many Jews there may have been. I figured that there may be two — 300.
  </p>
  <p id="964">
   Q: Okay. June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="965">
   A: But then later — now I — I keep the information that I have seen was that there were 2,000 Jews still in Birzai? Says, how could that be? Because that means that 5,000 people lived in Birzai, and there were 2,000 plus killed, that means almost like a half. So th-there is something wrong, but I think that that figure comes that when the Jews were killed in Birzai, they brought them from all other places, like including Papilys.
  </p>
  <p id="966">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="967">
   A: Probably that’s what — that’s how the 2,000 come. Th — it does not come from the city itself.
  </p>
  <p id="968">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="969">
   A: It comes — I think they collected from all other areas, and then th-thi-this — this 1s — this is the place where we’|l dump [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="970">
   Q: We’ll come to that.
  </p>
  <p id="971">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="972">
   Q: But right now, we’re — chronologically, we’re in that first Soviet year of occupation, where you — during this time is when you skip four classes, through your uncle’ s sort of both suggestion and — and strong advice —
  </p>
  <p id="973">
   A: So my first gymnasium class, the seventh, was already — was under the Soviets.
  </p>
  <p id="974">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="975">
   A: Yeah. https://collections.ushmm.org June 29, 2018

  <p id="976">
   Q: Do you remember anything in particular from that year, in that cla — in this — in this grade?
  </p>
  <p id="977">
   A: Oh yes, I k — I remember.
  </p>
  <p id="978">
   Q: What — what can you tell us about it?
  </p>
  <p id="979">
   A: I mean, there — one — one thing is — is that we immediately in this, besides la — that — no, no, no, no, the first — first year was still — there were no Russians the first year.
  </p>
  <p id="980">
   Q: Okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="981">
   A: That’s why I had one year of French — not fr — that — actually, before that, I had two years of French, and Latin, because the next, in the grade, under the Soviets, first then went out, Latin out.
  </p>
  <p id="982">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="983">
   A: French out, Russian in. French no good, Latin no good, Russian good. So I had at least one year —
  </p>
  <p id="984">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="985">
   A: — of —
  </p>
  <p id="986">
   Q: Russian.
  </p>
  <p id="987">
   A: — Russian. June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="988">
   Q: Well, that would make sense, because the government, in July 1940, is when there is that vote to join the Soviet Union. And that would have been after your seventh class —
  </p>
  <p id="989">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="990">
   Q: — but before your eighth.
  </p>
  <p id="991">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="992">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="993">
   A: And then, one new category was introduced, the political education.
  </p>
  <p id="994">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="995">
   A: The political teacher, political —
  </p>
  <p id="996">
   Q: And who was the political teacher?
  </p>
  <p id="997">
   A: Don’t remember his name. But very boring, talking like somebody who tells that this is what happened, this is what communist party is, and what’s a — it’s very good for the people. Talking always a very monotonous voice, and very like somebody who did not believe in it himself. Somebody who was like assigned material, he did not sound that he believed in what he was —
  </p>
  <p id="998">
   Q: Sounds like a parrot, almost.
  </p>
  <p id="999">
   A: — what he was saying. But you had to learn, you know, first thing you had to learn by heart, the history of the communist party. A-And then, there was another one. He was, you know, radical — class to teach. That was the subject we had to learn. ButJune 29, 2018 then there was another, assigned — a ka — general political supervisor of the gymnasium, of [indecipherable] the high school. And don’t remember her name. She was a woman of some 40 — 40 — some 40 years, and she was always there, and we knew who she is, and why she is there. And when she was approaching passing, everybody became silent until she passes, and — but I — to me it’s wa — very, very — became very, very, very important, this woman. She was also hated, hated by everybody, not — not for another reas — that — because she was Jewish. And because the mayor, as Soviets marched in, the mayor — they appointed as the mayor, a Jew educated in Moscow, Kelber(ph)
  </p>
  <p id="1000">
   Q: Kelmer(ph)?
  </p>

   A: Kelber(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1002">
   Q: Okay, k-e-I-b — [break]
  </p>
  <p id="1003">
   A: — at me straight, and says, never do this again.
  </p>
  <p id="1004">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1005">
   A: And put that — puts where it was, just [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1006">
   Q: Wow. That could have ended a lot differently. Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1007">
   A: And thi — and that’s, you know, one of the moments you never forget.
  </p>
  <p id="1008">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1009">
   A: Because it could have ended badly, not only for me, but for — also for my family, and — and we don’t know how far that would have gone. But then, all these years, I June 29, 2018 have been also thinking, why did she do that? I mean, one thing that, you know, was —I was still very fragile, and very naive, and very — sort of like, she may have really meant okay, he made — he’s a stupid, little guy, and he made a mistake. If I tell him maybe — you know, she like, had a picture of me. But then I thought, maybe she played double game. Maybe she worked also for the underground. She may have worked — okay, here I am, I’m hated, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="1010">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1011">
   A: — by everybody. I will — knew that, but I will — will be — I will also help the underground. She may have been a double like, agent.
  </p>
  <p id="1012">
   Q: Was she — do you know if she was from Birzai herself?
  </p>
  <p id="1013">
   A: No, no, she — she was not from Birzai.
  </p>
  <p id="1014">
   Q: Okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1015">
   A: But when the — and now, now, when you ask this question, I — I — I cannot guarantee, really. We assume that she came from Moscow with the — you know, but she may have had some relatives in — so, I will never know. I will never have an answer, because later in that she retreated together with the — when the Soviets retreated, and she was shot with other Jews. But she saved my life.
  </p>
  <p id="1016">
   Q: Yes, she did. Yes, she did. And it’s interesting how they — I mean, did that mean that they look through all the caps of the students, to see if there are papers in them? June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="1017">
   A: No, they knew. They were educated, they went — went to KGB training, you know, where to look next, if somebody hides something. They knew where to look for — where people usually — they had track of record where people usually hide.
  </p>
  <p id="1018">
   Q: Did you speak of this to anyone at the time?
  </p>
  <p id="1019">
   A: I could not. I could not. Because I could not let the other students — they were asking, so what did she tell you? I made a joke, or something, but I could not tell, because then other students would know that they are connected with underground. I could not talk.
  </p>
  <p id="1020">
   Q: And they wo —
  </p>
  <p id="1021">
   A: And later — I don’t know where that was already, on the Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="1022">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1023">
   A: That’s another story.
  </p>
  <p id="1024">
   Q: So, did you ever —
  </p>
  <p id="1025">
   A: But this, I— I —I-— there, I could not talk about it at all, to nobody, absolutely nobody.
  </p>
  <p id="1026">
   Q: Not even the student who had given you the leaflets.
  </p>
  <p id="1027">
   A: No, I could not.
  </p>
  <p id="1028">
   Q: Okay. Okay. Now, you mentioned earlier, someone who had been the mayor of Birzai, Mr. Klabees(ph), is that his name?
  </p>
  <p id="1029">
   A: Kle-Kle-Kleibas(ph).June 29, 2018

   Q: Kleibas(ph), Kleibas(ph). And then a new mayor comes —

   A: Thanks to him, I bought my first Bolex camera.

  <p id="1032">
   Q: Oh, no kidding.
  </p>
  <p id="1033">
   A: He lent — he was the guaran — guarantor, for when I had to buy, and had no money. I went to Peerless(ph), and he was the guarantor, so that I could pay in installments.
  </p>
  <p id="1034">
   Q: That’s quite a significant step. Now, was he — he was the mayor, and then comes the Soviet system, and then comes Mr. Karibel(ph), or Draugas(ph) Karibel(ph), Comrade Karibel from Moscow. Did — does that mean that Mr. Kleibas(ph) was thrown out, or did he stay?
  </p>
  <p id="1035">
   A: Must be, because — must be.

   Q: Got it. Got it. It’s okay, that’s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1041">
   A: My interests, I — people don’t understand that — how could one be, and done what [indecipherable] with no interest in what’s around me. In the social life, I don’t know if you are aware — you must be aware that somebody did a very, sort of dirty paper on me in — in the New York book. June 29, 2018

  <p id="1045">
   A: And ha — it’s all — you know, it’s all absurd, all these [indecipherable]. But I could not — he could believe — he could not understand that one can be so totally submerged in what one is interested in, and lack for — he was ask, would you tell me, you must have been very involved in — in — in — in the local, you know, with the [indecipherable] I don’t know the society. I know no — I knew nobody there, and was not interested, you know. He say, oh, but you wrote in your book, “I Had Nowhere to Go,” that you were very, very involved in — in — well, I was. And people who were ri — who were in literature, they knew. But that was my work. The rest did not exist. That’s all. So that — that’s — life was going there, you know, everything —
  </p>
  <p id="1046">
   Q: Did you ever —
  </p>
  <p id="1047">
   A: So I don’t know, I never asked — same as never asked my own father, you know, who was your father? So, Kleibas(ph) to ask — Kleibas(ph) never came to my head. The more that I met him here in Brooklyn, and we had already different problem here. So — but of course, automatically, I think the nec — I’m — what I’m amazed that he was not deported. Oh, I — I think he ran — he maybe had left before the se — Soviets came in. He knew, he was not that stupid. June 29, 2018

  <p id="1048">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1049">

   Q: Did you con — now, after that, did you continue distributing those leaflets, or had you —
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   A: Yes, and I even intensified, but that was a lesson, that was a lesson that — how foolish I was. And I di — you know, I — I did not carry — I had to be much more careful.
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   Q: Well, who would you get them from, and who would you give them to?
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   A: This very — okay, first where I got them. There was one teacher, Kavalunas(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   Q: Kavalunas(ph), okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   A: Kavalunas(ph). He later ended up in Chicago. And he started the Lithuanian department of that University of Illinois.

  <p id="1058">
   Q: Okay.

   Q: Vitakunis(ph), okay.June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="1061">
   A: Vitakunis(ph). So, I know what happened to Kavalunas(ph), I don’t know what happened to Vitakunis(ph). But, Vitakunis(ph), when she was studying, his — hi-he —he studied history of liter-literature, and this thesis that she wrote, was on the — on cu — futurists, Dadaists, the whole period transition, beginning with the — with the — what was happening in — in — in Russia, pre — before even Mayakovsky here, with the young Mayakovsky, and all the — the — all the early constructivists, etcetera, were the early, modern arts. That was his dissertation, and he was deli — teaching literature in the — in the high school. So, one day, he said, don’t tell anybody, but I want you to — to read this now. He said, now it’s, you know, forbidden, even to know — read about the history of the — and I read this dissertation. And that was my introduction to many, many, many things.

  <p id="1062">
   Q: Okay, so yes, of course Mayakovsky —
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   A: An introduction to modern art in the — in the west [indecipherable] Russia, in Paris, etcetera. And then a — we discu — tal — after I read it, and thanked him and returned it, we sort of became friends. And then it was he who gave me the first leaflets. And then he in — he wrote — he did not introduce me personally, but Kavalunas(ph) appro — yo — he — they knew tha — you know, Kavalunas(ph) and Vitakunis(ph) were like that.

  <p id="1065">
   A: Yes. So, he told me that, you can trust this guy. So Kavalunas(ph) was the one — Vitakunis(ph) had not — he was not so connected with the underground. But Kavalunas(ph) was very involved. I don’t even know how deeply. He was very, very, very, very. So, the leaflets came to me from Kavalunas(ph). We used — and we used to meet — a-and we — we ru — at the — at the castle, somewhere.
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   Q: And, what was the content of such leaflets? What was written in them?

  <p id="1097">
   A: No, I did not get it — no, since then I did not carry, because they — they won’t — I did not know, maybe she informed somebody else about me, and I may — maybe — may have been followed. I had to be very, very, very careful after that.

  <p id="1098">
   Q: So you didn’t — you didn’t continue, and —
  </p>
  <p id="1099">

  <p id="1100">
   Q: During this time, was there any violence —
  </p>
  <p id="1101">
   A: Also, that — that — that happened actually very close also, to the Germans marching in, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1102">
   Q: So that would have been spring 1941, because they march in June, in 1941.

   A: Yes, yeah.

  <p id="1104">
   Q: Okay.

   A: And that’s wa — maybe why I don’t remember her name, because I met her very, very soon after that, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1106">
   Q: Okay. Now, during the Soviet time, was there any open — you talk about this atmosphere of fear, that’s even hard to describe, but it kind of descends. Was there violence? Did you see people beaten up in the street? https://collections.ushmm.org June 29, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="1107">
   A: I was — there may have been, but I’m not aware of th — I was not involved in it, and — and the use of any violence against Soviets in Lithuania would have been very, very, very much kept suppressed by — by — by this — would be difficult for facts like that to come out.
  </p>
  <p id="1108">
   Q: I even mean violence by Soviets. Was there any —
  </p>
  <p id="1109">
   A: The violence as psychological, and — or — or — or direct, you know. If you are arrested in — you — you know — you know what happens [indecipherable] with so — the — the — how the Soviet police handled those whom they arrested, or — or deported. So that’s — if that is not violence, then what is violence, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1110">
   Q: I’m talking before the deportations, the actual deportations, in that intra-months, and so on, when you talk about that, was there —
  </p>
  <p id="1111">
   A: It was an — it was deviously — the control was like a — a — a — okay, it began immediately, because they came with a plan. And immediate wa — slow was the critique, of course, in the press and presentation of the existing, previous system, preparation for the — for electivization; it was to take place immediately. So that there were — they were restructuring every part of the society, of the — if the — under the Germans, who had, you know, they came in, in action, they were chasing somebody. They had no time to stop and — and control everything. Here they came in, and they settled down. In two days they cannot began — they began exerting their control. If under the Germans — you give them first page of the provincial paper, for June 29, 2018 their bulletins; it had to be, or — or [indecipherable]. Then you can do whatever you want. Under the Soviets, not a single sentence, not a single word we passed at — you cou — you could pass without being — without approved. Because they were there. They were, you know, they had nothing else to do, but to control and — and transform it into their own system. And their — you know, they came prepared.
  </p>
  <p id="1112">
   Q: So, is that sort of total control, you’re talking.
  </p>
  <p id="1113">
   A: And — and — and — no, we are talking about total control. Total. Absolutely total. And they always a — a— managed to call up if — I mean, many came already prepared from Moscow, the key persons. But many satellites, local, either — at the beginning, maybe even had some dreams and fantasies that this may be good, we can, you know, the — when — because all the propaganda was, you know, that this is it, this is great, this is way — you know, that was real bad, and now we’ll be paradise. And some felt — some sort of believed that, maybe not hundred percent, but th-th — they thought that they can also have some impa — impact themselves, and they say that, what I will do a lit — with we will shift it that way, we’ll be okay, maybe, maybe. So what happened later, like a — maybe when the deportations began, is something else.
  </p>
  <p id="1114">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1115">
   A: The be — e-even those who real believed that — that maybe had fantasies about that this could be maybe somehow turns the right direction, I think there were very, very few who believed 10 months later. June 29, 2018

  <p id="1116">
   Q: So, what was going on with your brother Povilas at this time? The Soviets have come in —

   A: But he was struggle still, you know, leftist, and he sort of — he had some ideas. Which is nothing wrong. But — but he was out of the — of the — if he had even any dreams that maybe this was clear with — immediately, it was clear to anybody.
  </p>
  <p id="1122">
   Q: At this point, Povilas would have been about, oh, 28 years old, something like that.

   A: He was — became also very closed just in his profession. He did not write any more, did not publish.
  </p>
  <p id="1128">
   Q: Hm. Well, you know, it was, for someone who has leftist leanings, this kind of experience was quite traumatic, because it is belying the idealism that a person could https://collections.ushmm.org June 29, 2018 have had, you know. And you have this inner immigration, what the East Germans call innere immigration, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="1129">
   A: Yeah, you know, that’s — that’s what — they said that. Unfortunately, the whole — this [indecipherable] communists started in their ow — in their own country, and their own time.
  </p>
  <p id="1130">
   Q: I want to touch on something else that you mentioned earlier. And you said — and that’s on the — the anti-Semitic aspect. You say that both the politruka —

   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1132">
   Q: — and the mayor, were hated —
  </p>
  <p id="1133">
   A: I think that — that fact that both were Jews, to the farming community, who had just 20 years earlier, managed to liberate from tsars, and had this very — like a sense of being independent, unfor — a-a-and still very, very fragile. To — to — to see that we are again of controlled by somebody else, if not tsars, then Jews, somebody. I think that these un — it was not — I could feel that. It was not talked much about, but jo — j- jokes were made about [indecipherable]. I don’t remember those jokes, but — but then the Russians — now we had again Russians, and the Jews, and the — a-a-and the — and I think that that aspect — this has not been — maybe it has been written about, sort of mentioned that this instituted just fresh liberation. And now again, somebody else is there, on the — on top of us. Had important effect, on the why some were — some — some of them ignored, or — or did not pay too much — and then, he — he — I — June 29, 2018 especial — the killing of Jews, coincided with the big deportation, you know, of Lithuania. But that minimized, I think, simp — sympathies for what was happening, at the same time, to the Jews.

   Q: Okay.

   A: It affect how much, you know, the — like — like same went out and discuss, you know, how Putin and Russia affected Trump’s el-election — election, and one says this and this, the other [indecipherable]. But definitely, yes.

  <p id="1136">
   Q: And had you heard before, like in — before these events, before the Soviet takeover, had you heard people make jokes about Jews, or say anti-Semitic things?
  </p>
  <p id="1137">
   A: No, no, no, Jews were some — and what — even if I could read in those transcripts from BBC, and later in the — you know, was typing them, it’s still — it was so outrageous, that many did not believe that this really happened.

  <p id="1138">
   Q: Okay, what —
  </p>
  <p id="1139">
   A: Saying that you don’t re — hu-human beings are not made up to react personally to — to abominable events. Like, okay, I — I have to confess that I did not react to the 9-11 event, until I saw — met some, really peop — people who just managed to escape. Or the — or the — the firemen from SoHo, right there where I live, then — then it became real. When I watched the buildings collapse, and I knew that thousands of people are there collapsing, I-I had no emotional res — it’s like, it was too big. It was too big. June 29, 2018

   Q: Not that you — does it mean that when you had no emotional response, you didn’t care, or it was too big?

   Q: Oh, you know, that reminds me of what Stalin said, which many people say was his strategy and his tactic, that the death of six million, or — he didn’t use the word six million, but the death of a million is a statistic, the death of one person is a tragedy.
  </p>
  <p id="1145">

   Q: You know, I’m paraphrasing here, but it’s —
  </p>
  <p id="1147">
   A: Well, that’s [indecipherable] it’s too — it’s too big. We are not made up psychologically [indecipherable] and that you need something personal, something that you could iden — identify. So —

   Q: So here is my question. When you —
  </p>
  <p id="1149">
   A: So when I was sta — people were — those — again, the nor — the population did not get that information, those newsp — [indecipherable] newspapers.

They’re taking out somebody in the https://collections.ushmm.org June 29, 2018 village shoots one German soldier, they wipe out the whole village. They believed, and they did not believe. It was like it’s — how could anybody do — be so horrible, you see?

  <p id="1150">
   Q: So, you’re talking — if I can — I’m going to try to anchor this —
  </p>
  <p id="1151">
   A: Yes, yes.

   A: What Germans were doing, it was not — not — not so real yet.
  </p>
  <p id="1162">
   Q: But was the BBC, at this time, while they’re still allies, the Soviets and the Germans, were they transmitting already, the crimes of the Germans against the Jews? That is, was that something that you were picking up? 100 June 29, 2018

  <p id="1163">
   A: I—I think they were — when they did already, they were doing that in Poland, you see —

And — and people were a-at — in their circumstances, non-Jewish people, the Lithuanians, and whoever else was not Jewish, was looking at the Jews who might have been put in power, and saying, look at, they have brought a new regime, we’re not independent any more. And at the same time, if they get news from some underground press, they don’t believe it too much.
  </p>
  <p id="1173">
   A: Yeah, but the — but [indecipherable] as I said before the bys — the population of the Lithuania — Lithuania did not know that, did not get that news. They did not read BBC then, yeah.

   Q: Okay, okay.

   Q: That’s okay. Now we come to June 1941. Do you remember the actual deportations? Did you see any of it?
  </p>
  <p id="1191">
   A: At — during one period — and, but I do not know a — if it was during that period, and I don’t know what month, but I remember that, with some other — some other friends, students, the railroad station in Birzai was lit with sort of — on the side of — https://collections.ushmm.org 102June 29, 2018 not in the center, as in many old cities, which will be — on the side of the city. And I —I was very good in mathematics, and some other things, and I was tutoring some students in mathematics, and — and not far from this station. And — and then there, as we walk back to my place, says, let’s go around. Those — those are the trains where the — yesterday th-th-they arrested, you know, some [indecipherable] they are full, and there are guards, and they’re ready to go to Siberia, or wherever they send them.
  </p>
  <p id="1192">
   Q: So someone told you, as you’re going back, that — first of all, the train station 1s not in the center of town, it’s on the outskirts, in Birzai.

  <p id="1193">
   A: On the side, sort of.
  </p>
  <p id="1194">
   Q: On the side.

   Q: And did you see the guards? Did you see guards?
  </p>
  <p id="1197">
   A: No, we were to — too far to know — know. To that we just saw — you could see the train. So that’s the — the only thing that I — I could ever — ever under — you know, and I don’t remember which ma — I don’t think this was — because I was not in BirZai during that June — during that period.

  </p>
  <p id="1863">
   A: Because I was — there — there was exactly the same name, a writer, playwright in Chicago. So I thought he — I did not know he moved there, is it the same person? Telling the truth, I never asked him, I never met him, if he is that person.
  </p>
  <p id="1864">

  </p>
  <p id="1873">
   Q: You must have trusted him.
  </p>
  <p id="1874">
   A: He trusted me, because he admired me. First he knew the reputation I had f-for a- a-a-a perfect speller, and that I, you know, was a good — I knew Lithuanian language well, so that I will be able to correct, and — because it had to, you know, put in good shape. And then he was writing short stories, himself. That’s why I thought that maybe the connection is with — in Chicago, that guy, which he used to give me to read, because I had, you know, already, a certain reputation, you see.
  </p>
  <p id="1875">
   Q: So he shared his shto — his stories with you?

  </p>
  <p id="1897">
   Q: Sure, let’s get there now.
  </p>
  <p id="1898">
   A: — that — so he comes to pick up, and I said no, I could not type, because the typewriter was stolen. He — he like — he immediately like panicked. I could — I — I - the change that took place on his face, his whole attitude, he — he totally panicked, because this — he had told me before that, take good care of this typewriter, that this germ — you know, the German police is looking — military police is looking for that type. So what hit him remains mystery in a way, to me because what — his first act was, he came — it was raining and they had a raincoat. He pulled out a gun — he pulled out a gun, and held it in my face. You’re not fa — it’s — it’s — it too — you know what this means, 1n this — it — what this means, that this — you could be end of — not end of me, it could be end of you. You know this. And then, he puts down. What that act — I could not — even today, I — I see, I see that moment, that I don’t 161June 29, 2018 understand his feel and motivation, but I think it was a — like a panic. Sudden realization that this could be in — Germans discover, and that he sells it, it’s discovered. I mean, it was — it was bad, but his reaction was — why didn’t — he could have just told me. Why did he take — have —
  </p>
  <p id="1899">
   Q: Why did he pull a gun on you?
  </p>
  <p id="1900">
   A: Why did he pull — yes. And that, I— I’m still, you know, when I remember that moment, I — and it’s very vivid, and I’m still see — you know, mystery. But I think he sort of — it was panic, realization and panic. Something, some — and maybe he thought that how he — he could have thought that I’m lying, or faking that, because th — tha — that wouldn’t — I mean — me — I-I-I don’t know, it’s a myst — mystery.

   A: Why he got it? Because he was in Birzai more — mo — maybe of five people who spoke German. And Germans, when they really needed somebody, needed, went to him. Also, he managed, because of his German he ha — managed we — because I was already the age of the draft — being drafted into the army.

   Q: So the doctor understood immediately? June 29, 2018

I said, why — why — why — why not — not you? Why am I to complain here, yeah. But hey — and with — with no second thought, I said, sure, I will do it.

  <p id="2085">
   Q: Were you?
  </p>
  <p id="2086">
   A: No. I did not think at all. I was so naive, and so innocent. And I think that’s why — because you know, th-th-the previous two people who comp — complained, they are not here any more.

  </p>
  <p id="2230">
   Q: Yeah. Did you work at any time —
  </p>
  <p id="2231">
   A: Everything went — and that’s why I say I lost with the quo — during that period of occupations, I lost like, regular education. I really had no — well, you know, usually you have gymnasium, then university, step by step, and then gradually you become this or that. I did not have that. So I lost the normal growing, like, period. I jumped from child to — to — to 27, when I was — landed in New York, I was 27. So there is almost six, seven, eight, 10 years, totally messed up.
  </p>
  <p id="2232">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2233">
   A: Which then, the way my story goes, I tried, you know, to grab as much as I could, and as fast, like choking, you know, life, what I missed, when I came to New York. July 1, 2018 There was no ending, no — I had no day when I did not go to theater, when I th — I missed nothing that opened in New York, like for three, four, five years.

  <p id="2235">
   A: No, even the universit — they were ne — after the war, you know, we’re still in displaced person camp, and the camps are moving, moved around. First Wiesbaden, okay Wiesbaden. The next, Wiesbaden, Mainz. There is a good university, so we enlisted with Adolfas into university. But then a year later, they — they moved us to Kassel. So I had to, for like a —a year, I commuted, once or twice a week from Kassel to Wiesbaden.
  </p>
  <p id="2236">
   Q: From Kassel to Wiesbaden.

  </p>
  <p id="2241">
   A: I started with philosophy, then I change it into literature, with — with — in reality, I was going to any class that was — I could — you know, co — tha — that sounded interesting. https://collections.ushmm.org 189July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2242">
   Q: Let’s go back still to Lithuania. Did you ever work at another newspaper, besides BirZu Zinios, or Naujosios BirZu Zinios, in PanevéZys?
  </p>
  <p id="2243">

  </p>
  <p id="2244">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2245">
   A: Which was — one step sort of more — okay, it was edit — BirZy Zinios were edited by like — they were an education, Rudise(ph), and Lupniiinas, they were, you know, teachers. What their other interests were, I never, you know, def — you know, patriots, educate — educators. Panevézio balsas was edited by Jonas Narbutas(ph), who was a writer, and had — was very closely connected with the Lithuanian writer — artists, writers community. So, it was a more — they gave more space to — to — to — to —he gave it to his friends, and they were writers, so there was — it was more like, literary. Still the same — the same system, the same like how the fir — first page, to the w-war — to Germany, and war machinery, bulletins. And then the rest the same, [indecipherable] structure, local culture, and —
  </p>
  <p id="2246">
   Q: And you’re —
  </p>
  <p id="2247">
   A: — but it was the — the — the atmosphere mo — was more intellectual, because it — in Panevézys, there were several very — very important writers and si — and science people, like Ivanauskas, there — it — 1t was — a-and of course, the theater, and Miltinis. It was a different — a-and many of the Kaunas people, mostly about https://collections.ushmm.org 190July 1, 2018 [indecipherable] etcetera, used to come to visit when they went — came to Panevézys to visit their friends. Very often the — I could sort of sit in the corner, also, and listen.
  </p>
  <p id="2248">
   Q: So what was your involvement with Panevézio balsas?
  </p>
  <p id="2249">

  </p>
  <p id="2250">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2251">
   A: To type, and then to proofread, to — to — to some of — I did not have to read already all of them, like Birzy Zinios, when Lupniiinas used to pass to me the materials. Sometimes I — mo — I tried to read them all, and tried to correct pre — paneva — Panevézio balsas had already a proofreader, and they had, you know, corrector, so I — my function was to see that everything is there, every area, and everyone who’s responsible for local news, for the art, or what’s happening in the — in the arts in Panevézys, that they delivered it on time —
  </p>
  <p id="2252">
   Q: So —
  </p>
  <p id="2253">
   A: — and then to put it — the — the — the term was, I guess I invented it, technical — technical, I-I would say, editor. https://collections.ushmm.org 191July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2254">

  </p>
  <p id="2258">

  </p>
  <p id="2259">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2260">
   Q: But then in Panevézys, it was more than just layout, it was also responsibility —
  </p>
  <p id="2261">
   A: In— oh, in Panevézys, all the materials are there already, ready on the — my table, to take to the linotypist. The linotypist passes, brings to me, and then I pass it to the proofreader, and then he brings me back, and I take back to the linotypist, he corrects. And then, like a next day or so, 40 hours — it’s a weekly — 40 hours later, all the metals are there, ready to put it into pages and places.
  </p>
  <p id="2262">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2263">
   A: And I — and — and I did all that.

  <p id="2264">
   Q: So, within this — these responsibilities, did this include the political articles that were required —
  </p>
  <p id="2265">
   A: Whatever was — whatever was there, ended up on — on my table, ready to — to — to —if1—sometimes with a note that, please read — check the language. These writers, July 1, 2018 sometimes, you know — I will look, we think it’s okay, but maybe could you check — check again.
  </p>
  <p id="2266">
   Q: Okay. So —
  </p>
  <p id="2267">
   A: That’s — that’s about it.
  </p>
  <p id="2268">
   Q: So —
  </p>
  <p id="2269">
   A: But everything ended up, you know, on my table.
  </p>
  <p id="2270">
   Q: And that’s in Panevézys, and in Birzai’?
  </p>
  <p id="2271">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2272">
   Q: Okay. So —

  <p id="2273">
   A: [indecipherable] that in Birzai, I had also sometimes to — to — I th — Lipnitinas or this, did not know that something took place in — there was a reading, poetry or something, but I knew — and I — I order — I knew who could review it, so I-I had right —I had right to also order and engage some writers.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="2279">
   A: Not — not — not — nei — neither in Birzyu Zinios, nor PanevéZio balsas, and — and I believe same for all — all other regional newspapers after the — a year after th-the — the killing of the Jews, you could really try to find with the various — you need a strong light to find anti-Semitic article in any of those papers.
  </p>
  <p id="2280">
   Q: In the regional press, you’re saying?
  </p>
  <p id="2281">

  </p>
  <p id="2283">
   A: They were all concerned for the local cultures, and they were fed up with — they knew where they are, they knew where the Germans are, and — and — and what the Germans — Germans all about. And I — I wouldn’t say a hundred percent, you know, I’m not — I did not see everything. But not in BirZy Zinios, and not in pane — Panevézio balsas.

I would not — I could not 194 July 1, 2018 bet — I think some of that had been maybe totalitarian, I don’t know, because the — the thinking — a-and I told last time that I managed even to keep some out —
  </p>
  <p id="2286">
   Q: Yes, you did.

   Q: Okay. July 1, 2018

  <p id="2301">
   A: So who am I to talk? At some point I give up, of course, you cannot talk if you — the — the — the person doesn’t believe what you are saying.

  <p id="2302">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2303">
   A: Because a-all — yes, yes, yes.

   Q: So you were referring to Mr. Michael Casper, who wrote a piece on the — in the “New York Review of Books.” We’ll talk about that a little later.

   A: Okay, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2306">
   Q: Okay. Let’s now then proceed to — is there anything else about leaving Lithuania, about working in these papers, and about any of those activities, that you didn’t mention before, that you’d like to talk about now, before we go on to Germany”

  <p id="2307">
   A: I would still — I would add something t — about the local newspapers.
  </p>
  <p id="2308">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2309">
   A: Because they felt a certain respi — responsibility to their regions. And I think that I — they have to get credit, some of the people who worked on those pe — newspapers, for helping to — to keep the local culture going.
  </p>
  <p id="2310">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2311">
   A: And to te — and sometimes with even a danger, you had to outsmart — outsmart. Sometimes, I mention that some major articles had to summed up briefly, very July 1, 2018 briefly. And there — sometimes they — they did not exactly translate [indecipherable] wrote the way — they wrote it the way Germans would be — like.
  </p>
  <p id="2312">
   Q: Be happy with it.
  </p>
  <p id="2313">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2314">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2315">
   A: And they took chances. And it’s to their credit that — that they managed to devote ma — most of their — the body of their newspapers to that life of not only what was happening at that period, but there is a lot of the past, always, of — from pieces on their past cultural personalities of the period, I mean going like — going back to [indecipherable], yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2316">
   Q: Well, you know, two things come to mind; 1s that if we’re talking about articles dealing with the past, I think East Europe, if I — I’m going to — I’m going to kind of bring forth a stereotype, that east Europeans live in the past a lot, for le —
  </p>
  <p id="2317">
   A: But especially they — they — that — during that time, there was even a need. It was positive, to live in a— to go back to the past was positive.

  <p id="2324">
   Q: Here is another thought, though, and it also has a certain parallel into how people in the cultural sphere dealt with in Soviet times, that you have —
  </p>
  <p id="2325">
   A: Here it’s very — totally different, because there you — you could not ri — choose your own subject, could not choose your s — your own theme, and whatever you wrote was the re — everything was read, and had to be approved. In Germany, at that period, we don’t know what would have happened later, with, you know, a familiar, and — and — and know how it was during those two plus years. Because they were in the war, they were too busy. They could — they did not have enough personnel, friends, they were all soldiers.

  <p id="2326">

  </p>
  <p id="2331">
   A: Yes, I’m talking only about the so — but th — we know also, that it continued. That the control, total control continued near — continued until after Khrushchev, maybe, I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="2332">
   Q: Yeah, that’s — that’s what I’m saying, is that in later decades, there was also wiggle room, where people in the arts, and the culture would te — 1n the Soviet Union in general, and this included Lithuania, would — would write their perfunctory introductory paragraph, or —
  </p>
  <p id="2333">
   A: Yeah, yeah.

   A: Yes, I began noticing that there, somewhere around ’75, or something —
  </p>
  <p id="2338">
   Q: And so that in some ways, it is saying okay, we will work within the system, because this is all that we’ve got, and we’ll give them their duorkle(ph), their due, and then we’ll —

  <p id="2339">
   A: Yeah, yeah, that’s exactly what the provincial pa-papers did. 199 July 1, 2018

  <p id="2341">
   A: They — only that that — that duorkle(ph) was much smaller.

  <p id="2344">
   Q: Yeah.

  <p id="2345">
   A: — page one, the [indecipherable] bulletins, and then information, you know, when the farmers have to deliver grain, or potatoes, you know, that — for the army.

  </p>
  <p id="2348">
   Q: Okay, duorkle(ph), how do we say that in English? I can even think —

   A: That’s how, I guess, the readers treated — treated those pages, also.
  </p>
  <p id="2354">
   Q: But here, I — when you talk about that, here is another effect, and that is, perhaps, the price one pays. I mean, there have been a lot of artistic works, whether they’ve 200July 1, 2018 been in film, or in books, that have talked about, what does it mean to one’s sense of artistic integrity, and also human moral integrity, when you decide to play with the bad guys, whoever they are.
  </p>
  <p id="2355">
   A: Yeah, but there are — there were an — I know, during that period there were at least five poets, and five prose writers, who already had the — I think they — they got involved by mistake, because they — their first interest in the Soviet Union began before the Soviets came. So they did not even knew — know what’s happening there. They were sort of misled. But they were caught, and they — they — they still believed.

  <p id="2356">
   Q: You’re talking about those who were left at —

   Q: During the first Soviet occupation.

   A: I don’t remember. I read it, and I forgot it. I read it because I respect her as a poet, but what — we were all, you know, could not believe that she did — wrote the poem.

   A: How great — of course, it’s a poem, it’s happening, kind of a panegyric, kind of praising and admiring, and oh, he is great, he is fabulous. You know, I don’t remember the poem, I never read it again. 202July 1, 2018

  <p id="2400">
   Q: What did I want to — ah, there was one final thought that I wanted to kind of express, to get your views on it. And that is another, let’s say, danger, or gray zone, https://collections.ushmm.org 204July 1, 2018 that can appear. I mean, what your — what I see in your descriptions of how the regional press worked, how the — is that it’s an attempt to bring some non- propaganda material into the public sphere. Yet now, when I read, let’s say, or glance at papers from the time, they look particularly dangerous, because the non- propaganda sections could legitimize the propaganda sections. Do you see what I’m trying to say?
  </p>
  <p id="2401">
   A: No, but we did not see it that way.
  </p>
  <p id="2402">
   Q: No, you didn’t —
  </p>
  <p id="2403">
   A: We did not see it, we did not accept it there, we did not treat it that way. But we thought this [indecipherable] you know, this is that, that’s — you know. Who cares about that? But this is our — this is our culture, this is our paper, and we don’t care about that. It can be disputed, and there can be opinions, but in reality, when you are there, and when you really live in that situation, you try to out — outsmart, you — of course, you could not publish anything. You close the theaters, you cl — you do — you just give the milk, give the [indecipherable] whatever Germans ask. But that’s not how life goes under a — the occupation. People continue try to live, not to be disturbed by it, and try to continue their lives normally, and ignore, and sort of like to fight indirectly, 1n — in very invisible ways, the occupation.

  <p id="2407">
   A: Yes.

   A: But you’re talking to it we —
  </p>

   Q: — but have bi — reading it now, 60 years later, I see, for example —
  </p>
  <p id="2411">
   A: Yeah, but you are now, you are free, you are in America, or live in Lithuania. You are not there. You are from the outside, a different context. And — and — and you don’t — it’s like, okay, I think Michael said, you know, well, why did you really le-leave? Okay, this guy, Ostrauskas told you to go. This is not realizing how serious this situation can be, that to — we did not play games. It was not a game in which I was involved. It was in a real situation, as real as the gun under your nose. So you — you — so, okay [indecipherable] okay, you say that I should leave, you know, why should I leave? And also, the German military police looking specicfi — specifically for that face — typeface, was not a joke. Was no — so, it was all real. Now, it’s a little more less like, look — it’s like a game. It was not a game.

  <p id="2412">
   Q: Thank you. Okay. Okay. Let’s go back to Germany. There — I think that, if we have other thoughts, or you have other things you want to say about this, we can come back to it — 206 July 1, 2018

  <p id="2429">
   A: They could go to bars, they could go — still, I think they needed permission to leave the barracks, but they — they could — they were allowed to get — to write home, to receive packages. We were not allowed. We were a much stricter regime.

  <p id="2430">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2431">
   A: But we could go, you know, know that we were for a permit to go with a bookshop — and nobody asked to go to a bookshop, except myself and my brother. So they were looking — looking at us amazing — with amazement. And — and movies. That’s all where we used to —

   A: But — and we were permitted, during the — some weekend days, maybe sa — we- well, the — now I can’t remember, I think Sundays — all sort of — to go during certa — certain hours for — it took like 20 minutes to reach Altona station, which was the last station left there, and that was the only area not destroyed, and that’s where the bookshops — luckily, it was the bookshop area. And that was not destroyed, around the station of Altona. So we — we — and where — very often, when we were the — we a— we — we — we tried not to go. We avoided Hamburg, because whenever we went [indecipherable] to the bookshop, it was always air raid. So we used to — and the train was always there to — to go out of town, and it — the — and — and so usually we ran to the train and — and then the train moves — moves away, like for a mile, to the suburb, and stops, because they used to bomb running trains.

  <p id="2499">
   A: Because the bomb [indecipherable] other factories. They could not get metal, they could not get thi — so suddenly, from 16 hours a day of work, or somewhere there, they began cutting. First they cut one hour, then another hour, and of course, the more hours they cut, as they were cutting down, our — our spirits got — went the same speed up. We knew that oh, they’re running out of stuff.
  </p>
  <p id="2500">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2501">
   A: But, well, that was not much better than the work, because you still had to be there, and many hours, and — and since there was no more materials to really do the work on those pieces, they — we had like to keep cleaning. Keep cleaning and cleaning, and like 1-1t was, we came so bor — to work, you will work, you do, automatically you begin to forget even that you are working. You begin to dream, and your future fa — fantasies. But when you just cleaning and cleaning, the boredom of it is — 1s — 1s — 1s suffering.
  </p>
  <p id="2502">
   Q: Okay. And so —
  </p>
  <p id="2503">
   A: So eventually — and that’s when we concocted a — when it was reduced to like five or six hours of actual work, and the rest was cleaning, we thought, with Adolfas what — okay, when we came — when we left with — on the same train — not on the 214July 1, 2018 same, had later somehow, they joined — they transferred from some other train, into our train, two Karaims, Tinfavichas(ph). And then, when we arrived, already they brought us to Elmshorn, we found that there was one — one more Lithuanian, and he was — and I knew him from Birzai. He was a young graduate of medical school in Riga, Kregzde, Jonas KregZde, who was very, very, very, very bright, he spoke many — Riga had at that time — was a university where you could study Sanskrit, you could — oriental languages and philosophies and — and he spoke them all, and he was in music. We learned really a lot from him. So for some time they put him into our barracks, also. And it’s from him — and he was very close to Jakubénas — Jakubénas, prof — Professor Jakubénas was a — a — a te — te-teaching in Kaunas, and there was some religious institute, a Protestant religion institute, and he was quite, you know, prominent in his field in Lithuania. And he had the top — when some of the intellectuals left the be — because they’re so — so even he left a — during the first weeks, I think, or months of German occupation, and — and settled down in lud — in hoi — Holstein —
  </p>
  <p id="2504">
   Q: Oh, Schleswig-Holstein?
  </p>
  <p id="2505">
   A: Schleswig-Holstein. And Kregzde knew him, and the — a-a-and he was ver — Jakubénas was respected by local Germans there, and they — he persuaded them to give — to crack the — to — a job in one of the local hospitals —
  </p>
  <p id="2506">
   Q: Okay. July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2507">
   A: — because he was a medical — you know, he had just graduated. So he ended up here in — in Schleswig-Holstein, in — in — in that area. But before he left, he said, if one day you want to try to — to — to — if you think it’s realistic to run to Sweden to escape, I will give you some leads. He — he knew beca — from Riga, during his studies, he had made contacts with — with Sweden. So, but he said — but first if — before you go, go to Jakubénas and we — and — and s-see me, and I will give you then the last, latest contacts to the boats that could take you to Sweden from schwa — from —

  <p id="2508">
   Q: Schleswig-hol —
  </p>
  <p id="2509">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2510">
   Q: Schleswig-Holstein.
  </p>
  <p id="2511">
   A: From a — from a — a town just across, on the other side of the border.
  </p>
  <p id="2512">
   Q: Kiel?
  </p>
  <p id="2513">
   A: Denmark.
  </p>
  <p id="2514">
   Q: In Denmark. Oh, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2515">
   A: No. So, we — we talked. Somehow when the — the hours became shorter, we thought, why don’t we tell brothers Neunert that since there is no work here, you know, we could — maybe we’re willing to go to — to — to — they could send us to Kiel.
  </p>
  <p id="2516">
   Q: Okay. July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2517">
   A: But we also, when we said this, we knew that Kiel was bombed almost every day, every night. So somehow, I — he did not know what to do with the workers.
  </p>
  <p id="2518">
   Q: Because they’re all cleaning, they have nothing else to do.
  </p>
  <p id="2519">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2520">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2521">
   A: So, I think the idea came first — we overheard from him, that he was with his brother, he had a brother who was a very, actually nice supervisor there. He used to be a teacher, and when the war started, they put him in the factory. So, he never liked, he was o — and he, that helped me — you see, I had the machine, I was working with the machine. I all — always had little pieces of paper with German let — with German words. I was studying there, my language. So he used to come to me like a teacher, and then examine me. So, I think we overheard there was, then figured out — out what do do with the workers, and that’s when we dropped this Kiel idea. So said, oh, yes, I think we — we will be sending some people, some of the workers, because there they still have materials.
  </p>
  <p id="2522">
   Q: How did you know that Kiel was being bombed?
  </p>
  <p id="2523">
   A: It was not very far from us.
  </p>
  <p id="2524">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2525">
   A: All the workers knew, everybody was, don’t go there, don’t go there.
  </p>
  <p id="2526">
   Q: And did — was there anybody — did you get broadcasts from anywhere? https://collections.ushmm.org 217 July 1, 2018

   A: Only news — local, that — the — the newspapers.
  </p>
  <p id="2532">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2533">
   A: So — and so wa — one day, the Neu-Neunerts call us in, said — and give papers to us which tell — it’s clearly written that we are — that please permit to travel there, and that we’re going, it say, to Kiel, to that — to a factory so and so, and — and — and that’s it. So we said okay, we go. But on our way, as we — where we crossed the riv — river, we got rid of our documents, and we continued to Flensburg.
  </p>
  <p id="2534">
   Q: Okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2535">
   A: Naively thinking that, you know, we can very easily — but before that, we continued to Flensburg, and from there to — we walked to Husum.
  </p>
  <p id="2536">
   Q: Husum, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2537">
   A: Where Kregzde lived.
  </p>
  <p id="2538">
   Q: Lived, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2539">
   A: And he gave us some information where we — whom to meet on the other side of the border. So we go back to Flensburg, we board the train to cross — that was going towards Denmark. But just before we boarded the train, and the police comes and https://collections.ushmm.org 218July 1, 2018 asks for our papers. So we had the basic papers fro — that Germans had given to all their workers. So that it — identification was there, but the fact that wet — we’re supposed to report to Kiel, that was not there. They — that did not know. So, is it — no, you cannot — you cannot cross the border. So, they threw us out. So we — we walk around, and we took our time, we walk around, and we — we go into like two or three wagons, la — and we — and we — we walked there around, and we — we — we sort of jumped into — on a train that was already like moving out. But it — like in 15 minutes we realized that it was not going to Denmark, it was going back to — to Schleswig, or — or another town, back to where you — we came from.
  </p>
  <p id="2540">
   Q: Someplace in — in Schleswig-Holstein.
  </p>
  <p id="2541">
   A: Yes. But then we — we also noticed that this — every station, every train was full of German refugees, that there was — it was already — there were so many Germans running from the eastern parts, that already like was beginning of the chaos there. So we said, why don’t we mix up with them?
  </p>
  <p id="2542">
   Q: And did you?
  </p>
  <p id="2543">
   A: And that’s what we did.
  </p>
  <p id="2544">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2545">
   A: This is all like taking chances, but it was easy to take those chances, because we noticed that even the police could not control any more. https://collections.ushmm.org July 1, 2018

   Q: Did you have any Lithuanian documents when you left Lithuania? Any passport

   A: In [indecipherable] then we also noticed that th - when Germans run, they run in very organized way. They — they — they knew — everybody knew in what school they can sleep.

And why? Because at the same time, like for — there were, you know, all those millions of Russian war prisoners, and forced laborers, and immediately the Soviets had, you know, made a deal with the 225 July 1, 2018 Americans and British, that they should all go back.

  <p id="2624">
   Q: With the Russians?
  </p>
  <p id="2625">
   A: Yes. Who were like — who was desperate to decide to go, or not to go, to go, or not to go back. But then they usually ended up at, oh, it’s bad, you know, and we have this — this guy, this criminal, this is our king. But Russia still is my home. So I —I go. I don’t know what will happen to me, but I’m g — I have to go. But then, every train, every, was supervised by — in all those groups, they were — who were dedicated members of the communist party. And they’re all in charge of those trains full of Russians. And they immediately put flowers all around, that the joy of going back home, and — and may have forced them to sing — to sing, and — and not only that, when we stood and looked there, they — they — they threw stones at us.

   A: And they were afraid that at the same time they considered that, you know, Lithuania is part of Soviet una — Union, many Lithuanians did not sleep during that pa — period, in the barracks at all. That they — they took them, they may take us also.
  </p>
  <p id="2636">
   Q: Okay. So, you were esta — were you afraid of this?
  </p>
  <p id="2637">

  </p>
  <p id="2647">
   A: Moved — sa — we stayed in Flensburg for maybe a month. And then we thought, we are stuck here. I-I mean, what — and — and there was nothing there. So then, why don’t we go tra — somehow, to the south, to the American zone. So we were — bought bikes, and we again — because they said, you cannot go, there are no — there are no bridges, no — how can you go, even with a bike? So we managed to reach on bikes, Hamburg, which is like 30 miles or so, through the center —

  <p id="2650">
   Q: Did you have anything like money?
  </p>

But — and went in wur — Wiirzburg — by the time we reached Wurzburg, I me — between Flensburg and Wiirzburg there was like a month of traveling, of no food, no water, no — every place you pass, and you — like there is a well, they said, don’t touch the water, it’s — it’s all contagious.

You know, we have all these people here, specialists, authorities in various subjects, so we could have a series of lectures. So, again he looks, and nobody wants to do it.

  </p>
  <p id="2890">
   Q: You never know how an — avant-garde can become controversial. I want to go back to another point, and I want you to describe for me, if you can — people, you know, have images that — of a group, and sometimes they get reduced to stereotypes, and sometimes those stereotypes happen to have truth to them, you know’?
  </p>
  <p id="2891">
   A: Yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2892">
   Q: And one image that stays in my mind is what a — what you had said earlier, during the first part of our interview, when we talked, and I asked, did you know of anybody who had participated in crimes against the Jews, who ha — could have been
  </p>
  <p id="2893">
   A: No, I can tell you right now.
  </p>
  <p id="2894">
   Q: You didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="2895">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="2896">
   Q: You didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="2897">
   A: No. But from Michael — Michael — Michael — his last name always falls — has written to me, has said that some of the people that I knew had practiced [indecipherable]. Like the po — and in which way? Not in crimes, in the — that the poet Matuzevicius(ph), who had — was in the — from gymnasium Birzai, two or three years earlier than me, and some of his friends — and so I understood from 249July 1, 2018 Michael that he has — that he has confessed to the Soviet secret police that during the shooting of the Jews, he was asked with his friends to take care to protect their home — their home belongings [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2898">
   Q: Okay, their — their items, their assets, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2899">
   A: Their assets. So that is the — so I— I knew, and — and actually admired li — like the — like the younger, budding, you know, poets cal — you know, want to be published, and want to be know — every young poet wants the — and has it — some people, close, that he — older poets that he or she admires. At that time Matuzevicius(ph) was the poet of [indecipherable]. He was the young, like [indecipherable]. And he was good, and very promising. It did not happen, because he was arrested, he went to Siberia, etcetera. He was destroyed. But we, all the younger of ones who — who were writing poetry, wanted to be poet, admired. So, it was — when I heard this from Michael, to me was a little bit of a shock. But he was also one of ‘the six.’ He said — so, in those six — and he wrote a poem about six with — which was pub-published in BirZy Zinios, at — I don’t know what — what — what month. And ‘the six’ became like heroes. People did not know that such — that they existed, when — and they found out tha-that somebody was in the underground. Whatever they did, some of them later, I— I— I don’t know, but I think they were instrumental to — to star — help others to decide that they should, you know, work underground also, like — like those six who worked against the Soviets. 250July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2900">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2901">
   A: Now, I thought it was — when I read it, I thought I — I als-also like admired that they did it, but I also thought, why is he publishing this? Though they — he did not name the names. The poem does not name names. But I thought — I didn’t know — of course, already, you see, I was in — connected to the underground, my own —
  </p>
  <p id="2902">
   Q: So —
  </p>
  <p id="2903">
   A: — by distributing leaflets, that is why. And then, this was already under Germans. And then, somehow it was clear that this was like wrong time to — to publish some — something like that.
  </p>
  <p id="2904">
   Q: So what you — if I interpret what you’re saying, is that Matuzevicius(ph) was a poet you admired —
  </p>
  <p id="2905">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2906">
   Q: — before then, with the Soviets, he works underground —
  </p>
  <p id="2907">
   A: Underground, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2908">
   Q: — against the Soviets, he’s one of “the six.’
  </p>
  <p id="2909">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2910">
   Q: When the Germans come, he publishes a poem about this —
  </p>
  <p id="2911">
   A: Six.
  </p>
  <p id="2912">
   Q: — underground six.
  </p>
  <p id="2913">
   A: Yes. July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="2914">
   Q: And you were thinking, this is not the right time to publish —
  </p>
  <p id="2915">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2916">
   Q: — your connection to ‘the six.’
  </p>
  <p id="2917">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2918">
   Q: Whatever that would have been.
  </p>
  <p id="2919">
   A: Yes, and later on I said — it was always what — why — why did he did that?
  </p>
  <p id="2920">
   Q: And the next time is when Michael Casper, who has written the “New York Review of Books,” article, mentions to you, shows you that he had confessed un — in a Soviet trial.
  </p>
  <p id="2921">
   A: Yeah, but you see, that — whatever is confessed to the Soviets, I never take it for real money.
  </p>
  <p id="2922">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2923">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2924">
   Q: Okay. But I started this questioning for a different question. And that was about —
  </p>
  <p id="2925">
   A: But I ended — your — your question ended up very simple, in three or four word, do I know anybody who killed, or committed criminal acts against —
  </p>
  <p id="2926">
   Q: I didn’t finish the question, though.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="2931">
   A: No, I did not know, cause — yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2932">
   Q: But the — what I wanted to say with that, is that when you answered this in part one of our interview, you said that, but in the DP camps —

  <p id="2994">
   Q: Okay. Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2995">
   A: No, because the — the farmers, they were much working with the Jews. The — the — the all — in Birzai, in Papilys, we depended on them. And I know from our neighbor, from my mother, fro — they were very [indecipherable] you know, like part of the family. It was not so — and that kind of the communist rumor, I did not hear from my farmers, actually, I heard that when I went beg — in the fall, when I went to the — to th — already back to the studies, in Birzai.
  </p>
  <p id="2996">
   Q: Yeah. I think that —
  </p>
  <p id="2997">
   A: And farmers were very open in — in the — at least northern Lithuania to the — and there were Jews in every smaller town. And that’s why, you know, when — when [indecipherable] all 5,000 people in Birzai, and then I hear from Michael that there were 2,200.

   A: How could it be? Not half of the city I haven’t seen [indecipherable] hundred. But in the — they were brought from those other little town, that are smaller, like — like Papilys, and — and they were, you know, sometimes maybe it’s three families.

  </p>
  <p id="3003">
   A: That when farmers, I think, there was a working — s-some of them, of course, were not happy that some maybe — I mean, there are all kinds of business sharks in every r— in every race, in every group. So some — there were Jews, like — like others, who wanted maybe to make some profit, more profit than they should. But in general, that was not in the air. It was a [indecipherable] and that in — I would say Lithi-Lithuania in general, now that’s why we had an — this renaissance of the Jewish cult — culture, literature, arts, in — in — in Vilnius, in — in Lithuania, and a century earlier — earlier.

  </p>
  <p id="3005">
   A: E-Even in the camps, I was not so involved with was going the camp. We were, three or four or five of us, interested only in literature, in the arts, we were publishing, working in that area. And the rest, again, did not exist to us, because we almost hated the rest of the camp, because to us they were just interested in to go somewhere, and be — make money, and become successful, and — a-and they were boring to — all of them. We kept ourselves apart. So, I’m not authority even to — I’m sure not even talk about it, the rest. 259 July 1, 2018

   A: And we look at Manhattan, from that big window, at the pier 23, and myself and Adolfas, I remember very clearly, we said, almost at the same time, and we said, here we are, in New York. It would be stupid to go to Chicago, when you are in https://collections.ushmm.org July 1, 2018 New York. We never went to Chicago. So, can we stay a day or two with you? And Landsbergis said, I will put you up for two or three days, until we find a job.
  </p>
  <p id="3038">
   Q: And what was your first job?
  </p>
  <p id="3039">

  <p id="3050">
   A: But the very first — second evening, we went already to a loc — to a film society in Manhattan, and we saw two avant-garde film classics.
  </p>
  <p id="3051">
   Q: What were they?
  </p>
  <p id="3052">
   A: One was known as doc — “Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.”
  </p>
  <p id="3053">
   Q: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="3054">
   A: The other was known as “The Fall of the House of Usher,” based on Edgar Allen Poe —
  </p>
  <p id="3055">
   Q: Poem. Or story, I don’t remember which it was.
  </p>
  <p id="3056">
   A: Because we read in “New York Times,” we bought [indecipherable] and — and we saw the announcement. I said, we have to see.
  </p>
  <p id="3057">
   Q: Well, our interview, of course, doesn’t cover this part of your life, which 1s the major part.
  </p>
  <p id="3058">
   A: Yeah, that’s okay, that’s — that —
  </p>
  <p id="3059">
   Q: But, there is one final episode that I’d like to touch upon, and that you already foreshadowed when you said that you wrote for “Iskusstvo Kino,” and therefore, became in some ways, not popular in the Lithuanian emigre community. But, it reestablishes a tie to what then is Soviet Lithuania.
  </p>
  <p id="3060">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="3061">
   Q: Either in your book, or you mentioned it, is that after the Soviets returned, your mother told — at some point — 263 July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="3062">
   A: Yeah, when I visited in 1971.
  </p>
  <p id="3063">
   Q: Seventy-one. She said that you — they had been looking for you for a year.
  </p>
  <p id="3064">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="3065">
   Q: Why?
  </p>
  <p id="3066">
   A: Because I th — first because I was not there, that means I may be in the woods, joined partisans; myself, Adolfas, were not there, where are they?
  </p>
  <p id="3067">
   Q: Yeah. You’re of the age, you’re of the age, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="3068">
   A: You ask — you ask — yes. You ask a mother — a mother doesn’t know. I don’t know where they are.
  </p>
  <p id="3069">
   Q: So explain for the camera what that means —
  </p>
  <p id="3070">
   A: Yeah, and then — and —
  </p>
  <p id="3071">
   Q: Excuse me. Explain for the camera what that means, to be in the woods, at that time.
  </p>
  <p id="3072">
   A: In the woods may — means that you joined anti-Soviet — Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisans.
  </p>
  <p id="3073">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="3074">
   A: So, they figured that I may have joined the partisans, but there may be other — another reason, because I had also somewhere in — in the maybe fall or winter of — of °41, you know, published in the BirZy Zinios, a stupid — a stupid little, you know, 264 July 1, 2018 poems, sort of banal. But it was anti-Stalin, anti-Soviet. Anti-Sta — the anthi — and the — “Stalin’s Anthem,” I think I called it.
  </p>
  <p id="3075">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="3076">
   A: And it was, you know, ah — very openly against Stalin.
  </p>
  <p id="3077">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="3078">
   A: So, I don’t think they liked that.
  </p>
  <p id="3079">
   Q: Okay. Did you ev — well, when you went back in 1971, that also suggests of having some special treatment on the part of the Soviets —
  </p>
  <p id="3080">
   A: Yes, as an — as an editor — “Film Culture” magazine — I have to tell you that, right now, when I’m talking to you, I should be in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="3081">
   Q: Ooh.
  </p>
  <p id="3082">
   A: Where th — a huge conference is be — opening tomorrow —
  </p>
  <p id="3083">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="3084">
   A: — on “Film Culture” magazine. International conference about the importance of the magazine. So the magazine, very fast, because it was the only serious magazine in United States, became very important of — for the — for the United States, and — and the world. It was international.
  </p>
  <p id="3085">
   Q: And this is a magazine you founded.
  </p>
  <p id="3086">
   A: A magazine that I started in December, 1954.
  </p>
  <p id="3087">
   Q: Okay. 265July 1, 2018
  </p>
  <p id="3088">
   A: So it became very fast, the leading world publication. I mean, this conference is just a reminder, and that what — what — and that magazine had contri — contributed to the — to the American film community, and the world. So, in Moscow, of course, they wanted to know — to have contact with anybody li — ist — ist — “Iskusstvo Kino,” had to go to “Film Culture.”
  </p>
  <p id="3089">
   Q: And therefore, to you.
  </p>
  <p id="3090">
   A: Came to me, and they kept inviting — inviting me to film festival, because they want — need coverage. So one time I decided to go, and that’s, of course, another story. In 1971, that’s when I went. Because I already, by that time, I was cle-clever enough, and learned enough of a — how the world works, that I thought I can use this maybe, to visit my mother.
  </p>
  <p id="3091">
   Q: And could you?
  </p>
  <p id="3092">
   A: And I did. But that’s a long story.
  </p>
  <p id="3093">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="3094">
   A: That’s another story. But you can read it, because it’s very funny.

  <p id="3124">
   A: And I thank you, because nobody asks me about th-th-th — that period of my life. And — and as time goes, you know, I begin to forget some as — so this forced me — forces me — even Michael, that’s why I’m grateful to Michael — he — he asked some questions that — that forced me to think, try to figure out, to tr— not have — as much as one still can. And because I’m preparing slo-slowly also, I’m collecting these materials, I will sort of have my own book.

You just t-take it all as you are — you’re somewhere else. You look at it, oh. And I consider that — I remember what our friend, Ken Jacobs, he has a son, Aza.
