  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Okay. Tell me about what your father’s profession was.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: My father was the officer in the Polish army, and he retired dru — early, at the age of 47, because at that time they wanted more younger people in the army. And he was a graduate of the so-called Russian West Point, with the number one vocation. And so he ret — he was ret — he re — he retired, and I had a great time with him, he used to walk in the park, on every Sunday in Kovel where I used to live, before I was deported. And he always was teaching Jewish university subject, like ROTC. So —January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: At a Jewish university?
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: There was a Jewish university in Kovel.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: What was it called?
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Pardon?
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Do you remember what it was called?
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Not the name itself, no.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: So, you say you were born in Lublin.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Did you live — did you spend your childhood there?
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Probably — maybe — I remember when — 19 — 1935, I was still in Krasnik, which was by Lublin. I was born in Lublin, obviously, in a hospital, but we lived in Krasnik, where my father was some kind of a official for the Polish army, or so. Krasnik — so in ’35, we’re still in Krasnik. So probably from ’36, we — we moved to Kovel.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Mm-hm. And is that far from Lublin?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: Oh probably, I — maybe couple hundred miles.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Okay. So, within — was it still in the same part of the country, then?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Okay. And — and what was Kovel, was that a village, or a town?
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: No, that was town, that was town.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Aw — about how many people? Do you know?
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: Offhand, probably 100,000 maybe, about. That I’m not sure of.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Did your sister play a role in your growing up, or had she moved out of the house when you were born?
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: Well, she — well, she graduated from high school, she moved to Warsaw, she was studying there. So, I had the very brief relationship with her. And of course, with the age differential, little brother.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: Well, in some ways then, did you grow up as an only child?
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: Yes, I did.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Did your father talk about his military experiences as a young man, to you? Did he tell you about what his early military career was like?
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: Yes, he was talking that he was a f — go-got first lieutenant when he graduated from that — I call it the Russian West Point. And then when Bolsheviks took over, they escaped to Russia. They expec — escape to Poland, and his parents lived there. Also, he had a brother, so he lived in Kovel, but he was a doctor, so Russians didn’t bother him.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: Okay. I want to go back to the time — the Russian West Point, was that within the Tsarist empire?
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Was it outside of Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Kiev, it was in Kiev.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: It was in Kiev.
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: It was in Kiev. So he was at first inducted, or — into the Imperial Tsarist Army?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: And did he fight in that army?
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: I don’t believe that he fought in that army, because he joined — he joined Polish underground, and so on.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: In those — in the — during World War I?
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: Yeah, correct.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: And your mother, was she from Lublin as well?
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: My mother, I don’t know exactly where she was born, but probably around Zytomierz or Kiev, in that area. And — and she was a registered nurse, and of course, during the — in Poland she didn’t work, because my father is an officer, made very good salary. As a matter of fact, we had a full time servant, and he had —January 31, 2015 he — he had — and we had the part time servant, and he had the orderly. Later, dis- discontinued orderly, but at one time, each officer had a —
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: Had an orderly.
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: Yeah, that’s right, so —
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: Okay. How do you say orderly in Polish?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: Ordynans.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: Okay, because another interview that I had this week, somebody was talking about an ordynans, and they couldn’t think the word in English, and I didn’t know what it was. And now I know. Thank you. Okay. So, to go back — so your mother was born in the territory of today’s Ukraine.
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: It if was Zytomierz or Kiev. And your father as well, or —
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: Yes, that’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: So they all came from the east, then.
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Vinnytsia or something like that. As a matter of fact, his parents probably were deported by — by Stalin, because a lot of people from that area, Vinnytsia, Zytomierz, Kiev, were deported.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: You mean jer — before the world war — world — World War II?
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: Yes.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: In 30s.
  </p>
  <p id="96">

  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: In early 30s, they were.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: Did he have any communication with his family? Because you were in Poland, and —
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: Not really, not really, th — the only communication, he was writing the Polish consulate in — in — in — about — asking about some of his papers, but I don’t — I didn’t see any postcards from — from his parents, so it, of course, when Bolsheviks took it over, probably 1-1f you are sending letters, they probably threw it in a round file. The circle file.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: So, did he talk much about his underground activities during World War I?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: Well, he wasn’t the bragging type, he just mention here and there, and he took part in a—ina-—inaf-—a fight against the Bolsheviks in 1920, and Poland defeated them, and —
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: So he was part of that battle?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Okay.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: And he really — in Poland, somehow government didn’t like people who got education in Tsarist Russia. They rather lean toward the people who were under Austria or Prussia.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: Why?
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: And he was — he was a graduate of the —
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Russian West Point.
  </p>

   A: Yes. With the number one —
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: Certificate?
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: Yes. So — well, like in many politics, there’s no like to — those people were too smart.
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: Yeah, that’s true. Do you know the name of this military academy that was in Russia?
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: Not really. Probably Kiev military academy or something. I probably could dig out from — from some of the papers that I have here, because at one time I was thinking about getting a lawyer and trying to — because my grandparents had a big, big, big landowners they were, around Vinnytsia. And one of the guy from Serbian society, he went to Ukraine about five, 10 years ago, and they paid him for his house which he had over there. Except he couldn’t take money fr-from Ukraine, so he got to leave it to his aunt, or something.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: So you’re thinking about reparations, about you some —
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: But you know, it’s getting late. I’m 85 now. Another month I’Il be 86, so —
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   Q: Well, congratulations, happy birthday. You — so your grandparents were landowners?
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: And they had two sons, your father and his brother?
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: And so did both of them finish higher education?
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: Oh, the one was the doctor, so evidently he —
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: — and he had to finish it in — in Russia, yeah. And ri —
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: And did they have girls? I’m sorry, I interrupted you. You — I — were they the only two boys, or were there more children in that family?
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: That’s what I am aware of, because I haven’t discuss it with my father, but I know for sure that him and his brother, because he lived in same town. And when the Russians came, he didn’t visit us be — for the obvious reasons.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: Of course, of course. Tell me a little bit about your mother’s family. Were they also landowners?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: That — I don’t know too much about my mother’s family, but evidently they were well-to-do, because she — she graduated as a registered nurse. At the time it was like at the university, at that level. So evidently, you — they could afford to send her, you know, to — for her education. So evidently they were doing okay.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: And was her family also in this Vinnytsia - Kiev area?
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: Evidently so, because you know, when the — my father and they met, so that they had to be someplace in the area.
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: Which — which to me suggests that — did you know any of her family members? It sounds like you didn — you wouldn’t have had the chance to do so.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: No, there was a elderly woman that used to live with us. She was a part of my mother’s family, but I don’t know what was her relationship to — to my grandparents there. But she lived with us, about 95 when she died.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: I see. Okay. But this is also unusual for the people that I’ve talked to, that so much of your parents’ families were on the other side of the border. And that that border was closed, you know, during the 1920s, and the 1930s. Most people had their families around them. The larger families. Did you — before World War II, did you visit with your doctor uncle much? Did you see each other often?
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: Oh yes, they used to come over to our house, we used to go to their house. And by the way, we were doing much better to hear that he’s a doctor.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Well, if your father was a high ranking officer, that would — that would make sense.
  </p>

   Q: Oh. And your uncle, you say he was also in a concentration camp?

  <p id="193">
   A: Yes, then he came back to Poland, br — as a matter of fact, she was buried at Pouwonski(ph).

  <p id="194">
   Q: Your sister?
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: Yeah. And I’m sure that right now it’s probably cost 10,000 dollars, the plot over there. But I’m sure during that — in 50s it was still — so he buried her there, so —
  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: Your uncle took care of that?
  </p>
  <p id="197">
   A: Yeah. And he wrote me couple times, and then asked me, why don’t you come back? And I wrote him back, I said, listen, I don’t want to come back to a country which killed my father. And so then I got the reply, he said, those letters with English stamps do me lot of harm. So our correspondence stopped at that.
  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: Oh dear, oh dear. Were you able to find out more about what his life had been under German occupation?
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: No, not really.
  </p>

   A: No, I wouldn’t know. But at — the letters did say that they were in a — in a cattle car, something like that, like we to Siberia. And sometimes they were standing in the water up to their ankles, and stuff like that. So there were some horror stories about his life.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: And it’s also — I mean, that is a tragedy, but it is also a tragedy that you could never meet and talk about these things. That you — that — that you were so separated, and you couldn’t correspond.
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Well, of course, back in 50 s — ’53, like any young man, 1s not interested in those things. I mean, I was always patriot, stuff like that, but you know, young people, they have different — for example, even here in — I jo-joined the Siberian society about 25 years ago. Before that 1t was playing cards; bridge, poker, stuff like that, so

  </p>
  <p id="208">
   Q: Well then, let’s go back a little bit, okay? Let’s talk about your family, your immediate family, your mother, your father, yourself, pre-war Poland. You said thatJanuary 31, 2015 your father earned quite good money, or must have had a very good pension, if he retired from the military, so that you had both a maid, and other household help, and he had an orderly.
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: Correct.
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: Okay. Can you describe your home to me, in Kovel?

   A: Oh, peachy, peachy.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: Peachy.
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Yes. As I said, we used to take walk in the park every Sunday. We used to go to the cemetery, visit this aunt - my — my mother’s aunt, I believe, that, you know, she died when she was about 95. And — and —January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Did you have conversations with him as you were taking these walks?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Oh yes, we were talking about different things, but he never — never talk about his military service, and stuff like that. He would say oh look, they building a new park here, and I used to enjoy it, even as a little boy, I say well, that town is going someplace. And —
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Did you spend as much time with your mother, as with your father?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Probably yes, yes, with my mother. Both of them were pretty strict.

   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="228">

  <p id="229">
   A: Well, for example, I didn’t go to the first grade, my father was tutoring me. That wasn’t the —
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: It wasn’t fun, huh?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: — best year of my life. And my mother, she was strict, but [indecipherable] for something, if 1t was reason — reason, she would say okay. And my father was, when he was at home, he was engrossed in his books about military, even though he was retired, and he was a big stamp collector, and this type of a thing. And as I said, it was — it was pretty nice.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: What was — why was it that you didn’t go to first grade?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: Well, my father says, why you should go with all these people there, where you can do it at home?
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: As a matter of fact, I only went to second and third grade. And then not — from that, I jumped to the high school. Wasn’t easy.

   Q: Mm-hm. And — and what kind of a personality did she have?

  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: Oh, she was tough. Sometimes, she was sick, had the heart condition and so on, and s-some — my father had the military doctor, so — but you know those military doctors, they didn’t think much of them. So he used to go to private doctor, even though, you know, uncle was a doctor, but he didn’t go to him. So sometimes a guy would come and say something bad to my mother, my mother says, get out of this house, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: She didn’t like the diagnosis.
  </p>
  <p id="243">

   Q: Were you studying any of these languages as a little boy?
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: Well, I— I— when I went to — to high school, I took English, because at that time you need only one modern language. When my sister went to school, she needed two classical languages, was Greek and Latin, and two modern languages, which was French and a —

  <p id="254">
   Q: And Polish.
  </p>
  <p id="255">

  </p>
  <p id="258">
   Q: That’s quite a classical education.January 31, 2015

  <p id="261">
   A: — just now, so yeah.

  <p id="266">
   Q: A — areal facility for a language.
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   A: And she spoke three languages, and later she tried to learn English, when we were in India. And some people here, they come and they spend here 40 years, and they don’t even learn English.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: And she learned it there?
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: She had a rough time with it, I’m sure [indecipherable] 50, so that’s —

  </p>
  <p id="274">
   Q: In himself?
  </p>
  <p id="275">
   A: — even though — even though he had, you know, good education, and so on. But he wasn’t pushy, let’s put it this way. And he — like in any — in any area, you have to be pushy, to really succeed.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   Q: And did you sense that from how you knew him, that he was more reserved —
  </p>

  <p id="294">
   Q: Just a scratch. Were your parents very religious, or not so much?
  </p>
  <p id="295">
   A: Not so much. They — th-they believe in God, but my mother very seldom used to go to church, and — and my father, right before the war, I think, he went to — to confession, and so on. And of course my mother was running the orphanage, and she was running the home for the old people.
  </p>
  <p id="296">
   Q: This is before the war?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="309">
   A: For her it was. And as a matter of fact, the president of the — of the Kovel, she was involved there as well, but later they found that she took some money, so there was a trial be-behind the closed door.
  </p>
  <p id="310">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="311">
   A: In those days when somebody got the big position, they used to get every break possible. Yeah, so — and the — on the other hand, my mother used to take some stuff from home, and take it to the orphanage and my father says, well, what are you doing? Says, don’t worry, it’s enough for both of us. January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="312">

   Q: Mm-hm. Did you ha — [phone ringing] Okay, let’s cut. [break] Did your parents talk about politics at home?
  </p>
  <p id="317">
   A: Yes. My father was for government. He subscribed to newspaper like “Polskas Bronna(ph)” — Armed Poland in — in English. And of course everything was rosy in that paper. My mother was it — reading so-called “Dzien Dobry”. They had different opinions.
  </p>
  <p id="318">
   Q: Your — who was reading “Dzien Dobry?”
  </p>
  <p id="319">

  </p>
  <p id="322">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="323">
   A: That was like, well, wasn’t very literal paper, but as it turned out, they were right, and the — then the “Armed Poland,” because “Armed Poland” followed the government line, and of course, everything they said, we’re not going to give youJanuary 31, 2015 the button from our coat, and you know, we lost war in 30 days, except France lost in 10 days.
  </p>
  <p id="324">

  </p>
  <p id="325">
   A: Yeah, my father was blindly following the government line, and my mother was rather realistic about the things.
  </p>
  <p id="326">
   Q: I see. And the government was headed by whom at that point?

  <p id="327">
   A: Moscicki.

   Q: Did they talk also, about international politics? That is, what was going on in Germany, and what was going on in Russia? Do you remember such conversations?
  </p>
  <p id="331">
   A: Well, of course they were talking about Bolsheviks, how bad they were, and so on. But as far as Germany, England, I don’t think they discuss it ver-very much. Of course, my father thought that after 20 years, the Bolsheviks became more human. As it turned out, they weren’t.
  </p>
  <p id="332">
   Q: Yeah. So they — beca — did they talk about Bolsheviks more because they were from the east?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="333">
   A: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="334">
   Q: Let me think. You mentioned before, your sister came to take care of your mother a little bit, in August of 1939. And your father begged her to stay, and he said, the war is coming, the war is coming.
  </p>
  <p id="335">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="336">
   Q: Did — did — did he have some sort of inside information, or was this something everybody felt?
  </p>
  <p id="337">
   A: It’s everybody felt that it’s a matter of days. As a matter of fact, he — he got the letter from — from the army that they inducting him back.
  </p>
  <p id="338">
   Q: He’s being mobilized.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   A: Mobilized, right. And he became the chief — chief of anti-aircraft defensive cover, except they didn’t have an air — aircrafts.
  </p>
  <p id="340">
   Q: So — so at that point, he was 51 years old?
  </p>
  <p id="341">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="342">
   Q: Okay. Do you remember the day the war broke out?
  </p>
  <p id="343">
   A: Oh yes, I do.
  </p>
  <p id="344">
   Q: Tell me about it.January 31, 2015

  <p id="345">
   A: Well, listening to radio. Radio that day used to say, this plane 1s crossing our border, this plane is doing this, and the Warsaw is bombed, and other towns are bombed, and so on. So it’s a—
  </p>
  <p id="346">
   Q: How did — how — what was — when your parents heard this, and when people in the — in Kovel heard this, how — how were people behaving? How were they reacting to this news?
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   A: Well, I think they took it in stride. For example, we — we lived — we lived close to downtown, and on one occasion we went to the — where there was a army headquarters, and they have a army mess over there, and we went there for lunch, with my father, mother. And as we were having lunch, all of a sudden the planes came over. You could see the faces of the pilots, and one of the lieutenants says, oh, those are Polish, because they got Polish insignia on the planes.
  </p>
  <p id="348">
   Q: Did they really?
  </p>
  <p id="349">
   A: They did. And as he said they are Polish, they started shooting. So we went — run away from the building, and there were some planes over there, so we hid in there. So that was like probably third and fourth of September.
  </p>
  <p id="350">
   Q: Amazing that they were so close you could see the faces.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="351">
   A: Yeah. They — well, there was no aircrafts. And the — later my father got couple with those aircraft guns, so then they were flying very high. Evidently they had some space on the ground.
  </p>
  <p id="352">
   Q: So those first few weeks, your — was that as close as you got to someone from the German military —
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="354">
   Q: — was this person in the plane?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="357">
   A: Not German, Russians.
  </p>
  <p id="358">
   Q: Okay. But before we come to the Russians, those first weeks before they — they arrive, what were people doing? What was happening in Kovel?
  </p>
  <p id="359">
   A: Well, they were going to work, and I think schools were closed, because they made the hospital with those schools. So — and I was going to go to the fourth grade, but never happened. And —
  </p>
  <p id="360">
   Q: By the way, were there Jewish people in Kovel?
  </p>
  <p id="361">
   A: Quite a few, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="362">
   Q: And what professions did they usually have, or jobs, or trades?
  </p>
  <p id="363">
   A: Running businesses, running businesses, what else?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="364">
   Q: Okay. Did your family know any? Did you have any interaction?
  </p>
  <p id="365">
   A: Oh yes. My mother had a good relationship with those Jewish people, because she was running that orphanage, so she needed some funds. So they — they were —
  </p>
  <p id="366">
   Q: Supporting it.
  </p>
  <p id="367">
   A: Of course, where we lived, the owner of this house was Jew, too, and — and I was talking with his son. His son was six, seven years older, and I was telling him that we going to beat Germans, and this guy says, no way, they’re too strong. Of course, he was 15, or something.
  </p>
  <p id="368">
   Q: So, two military experts having a conversation.
  </p>
  <p id="369">
   A: Exactly, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="370">
   Q: So, people still continued going to work, even though there was no school. What was the talk that was going on?
  </p>
  <p id="371">
   A: Well, really, we didn’t interact with — with the outside world, you know, we just —my mother, father, and myself, except for that trip that we made to that military mess over there. Cassino(ph), you could call it cassino(ph), really. So, I never finished that lunch.
  </p>
  <p id="372">
   Q: No, I guess not. So you stayed at home.
  </p>
  <p id="373">
   A: Yes. January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="374">
   Q: Did you — okay, did you do any preparations? Did you expect the Germans to arrive at some point?

  <p id="375">
   A: Well, we as a military family were given the gas masks, because at that time everybody was expecting the day going to — to gas, but never happened. So we — we — we received the masks, those high — high tech masks that — because the old ones, you could choke in them. The new ones, they were really comfortable, but we never use them. And later we cut them to pieces because they didn’t want Russians to take them over.
  </p>
  <p id="376">
   Q: Okay. So how do things progress throughout September? What happens?
  </p>
  <p id="377">
   A: Well, September 17", Russians entered Poland. And they were marching. And we — we lived in that house, and by that house there was a water pump. And as they were marching, this soldier — I was outside — came by me. Says, can you give me a cup, because I want to get some water. So to was — ma — my first interaction with the — with the Russians. And he was very, very polite, very nice. So that was probably on the 18" of September.
  </p>
  <p id="378">
   Q: Was Kovel close to the border?
  </p>
  <p id="379">
   A: Yeah, we’re very close. I don’t know how many miles, but yes, Kovel was pretty close to the border, Russian there. So, of course, my father [indecipherable] that, January 31, 2015 and when the Russians came they getting men to shovel the snow or something. So we were selling some different things, to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="380">
   Q: So, but that’s already in the wintertime.
  </p>
  <p id="381">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="382">
   Q: Before that happens, did you see many soldiers after that?
  </p>
  <p id="383">
   A: Oh, they were — they — they were di — there were whole columns of tanks, and everything else, going through Kovel, going east.
  </p>
  <p id="384">
   Q: Or west. Or were they g — they were going west?
  </p>
  <p id="385">
   A: We-West, right, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="386">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="387">
   A: Going west.
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   Q: Did many stay in Kovel?
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   A: Don’t know how many, but at one time we had a lieutenant living in — in our home. They took — took one room from us, and he was living there.
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   Q: That was pretty early on?
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   A: Yeah. Army — Army lieutenant, and by the way, he was very nice guy. Of course, a lot of Russians were okay, except for the government.
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   Q: Does there any interaction between your father and himself, because both of them are military men.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   A: No. My father was already arrested when this lieutenant moved in.
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   Q: Tell me about this arrest.
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   A: Well, it was the second day of Easter, in 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   Q: So it’s the se — it’s half a year later.
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   A: It was probably March.
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   A: Knock on the door, it’s three — three en - NK VD guys enter, and there was one civilian, who sort of sided with Russians. He was a Polish citizen. So they — we had the big radio. So they took that radio, they say it’s no way private person could have a radio like that, it had to belong to the government. And then he — had the leather — leather briefcase, they took that one too, and they took him away, and told my mother that he’ ll be released in — in couple days, which of course, never happened.
  </p>
  <p id="400">
   Q: Did they say why they were arresting him?
  </p>
  <p id="401">
   A: No, they arrested all the officers, all the officers —
  </p>
  <p id="402">
   Q: So, was he expecting this to happen?
  </p>
  <p id="403">
   A: Well, probably. But he had the chance to go to Romania, that — that was still when the war was on, because the — the people were going — from part of the government, they were going through Romania. So they stopped and they say to him, listen, let’s go with us, we go to Romania. And my father says no, I got to takeJanuary 31, 2015 care of my wife, and my — my son, so he didn’t go. Otherwise, he — he would survive. That was still in the — September, of course, that he had the chance to go to Romania.
  </p>
  <p id="404">
   Q: Do you think he fully — do you think he expected he’d be back in a few days, like they said?
  </p>
  <p id="405">
   A: Ah, probably not. My — my mother went to the NK VD, and says, where are they going to process him, and so forth. And she says, where is the radio? Oh, you’ll get it back eventually. Didn’t care about the radio, she cared about him.
  </p>
  <p id="406">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="407">
   A: And — but they made her offer. They said, we are going to release him right away, if you’re going to give us some information about lot of people in this town. And of course my mother turned them down, for two reasons. She was really patriotic. Second is she knew that they were lying. So, she didn’t pick up it.
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   Q: How long did this take, when they came to your home, and they banged on the door? Was it a half hour, an hour, sa — all day?
  </p>
  <p id="409">
   A: Oh, at least hour and a half probably. They were searching the house for — for guns, some reason. Suddenly that’s a — most hour and a half, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="410">
   Q: Do you remember saying goodbye to him?
  </p>
  <p id="411">
   A: Oh, he said goodbye to me. And he said, take care of your mother.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="412">
   Q: Oh my.
  </p>
  <p id="413">
   A: Never happened to me before. First time. Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="414">
   Q: Well, these aren’t easy memories. These aren’t easy memories.
  </p>
  <p id="415">
   A: So, what was, 24" of March? That’s six — three weeks later, another knock on the door. Again, three NK VD, and a private person.
  </p>
  <p id="416">
   Q: Same private person?
  </p>
  <p id="417">
   A: No, different. You got 30 minutes to pack.
  </p>
  <p id="418">
   Q: Did you recognize the first or the second person who came by, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="419">
   A: No, I didn’t know him.
  </p>
  <p id="420">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="421">
   A: Oh, he really was a member of communist party before the war.
  </p>
  <p id="422">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="423">
   A: And so, half an hour, and pack. My mother started arguing with those people, with those NKVDs. Probably Germans would shot her on the spot because she was telling them that Stalin gived his own mother, and so on. And I started to pack, and this NK VD man was helping me packing, because my mother didn’t pack.
  </p>
  <p id="424">
   Q: She was busy arguing.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="425">
   A: She was being arguing with them. And they also admired her language, you know, that they were exhaust probably. Great education, and she — she was a college graduate. So half an hour passed, hour passed, five hour passed.
  </p>
  <p id="426">
   Q: Were you still in the house?
  </p>
  <p id="427">
   A: Still packing.
  </p>
  <p id="428">
   Q: Packing?
  </p>
  <p id="429">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="430">
   Q: What did he help you take? What did you take?
  </p>
  <p id="431">
   A: Everything.
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="433">
   A: Like I have pictures here on that wall over there, my pictures from before the war. So finally the truck came, lorry, or whatever. What was happening, they were deporting so many people on that day, that they ran out of those trucks. So when the truck came, we loaded the truck all the way to the brim.
  </p>
  <p id="434">
   Q: Oh my goodness. How unusual.
  </p>
  <p id="435">
   A: Ie—I even took a dog with me.
  </p>
  <p id="436">
   Q: You took a dog with you?
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   A: Yes, I did.
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: What was the name of the dog? January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   A: Katsis(ph), or whatever.
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: What kind of dog?
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   A: Oh, mongrel. So then we go to the station, those cattle cars, all this stuff, and the dog. And of course we thought — we used to sell the stuff later in Russia, so —
  </p>
  <p id="442">
   Q: But you were able to take a lot of things with you.
  </p>
  <p id="443">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: But does it fit into the wagon, and there was space for it?
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: So tell me some of the things that you took.
  </p>
  <p id="447">
   A: Linen. The towels. I took some stamps that — my father’s collection. I took lot of pictures, and — and by the way, this lieutenant comes with a — th-there was a — before the war there was a jam in about maybe five pound cans. So he brings this sugar, and he says to my mother, take this. Because they keep telling you this — everything is in Russia, but there is nothing there.
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   Q: So this lieutenant who was in your house —
  </p>
  <p id="449">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   Q: — Soviet lieutenant —
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: He was living there, because they r— they di — took one room, see?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   Q: After your father is arrested for those three weeks, here was this lieutenant, in one of those rooms.
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   A: He was there all the time, and he brought that sugar, so we took that sugar. And he was a very nice guy, quiet and everything else, and of course he didn’t discuss politics, because you know, he would be afraid to discuss politics, and so there were, I don’t know how many, 50 people in that car.
  </p>
  <p id="454">
   Q: Was your — did your mother quiet down at some point? What happened?
  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: Not really. She was arguing with them all the time.
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: She was arguing, and you were packing.
  </p>
  <p id="457">
   A: Yeah, the — wi-with the — with the —
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   Q: With the NKVD fellow.
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: NKVD, yeah, right. He says, take a — take you can, but originally they get half an hour, but it lasted five hours, so we took lot — lot — lot of stuff, and —
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   Q: Did you take food?
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: Not — not really food. May-Maybe a little bit with the food, because we used to dry bread, you know, before the war, figure just in case. So we took some of that dry bread, and of course that was a February — April 13, so weather wasn’t bad as February 10, when the first people were deported.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: Did you know about those first deportation? January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: Oh yes, we did know, yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Did you know anybody who was deported on February 10"?
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Over here?
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: In Kovel.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: No, from Kovel they didn’t deport February 10", because they were deporting people who — who had parcels of land, see?
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: Oh. So February 10" was a different category of people?
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: Oh, different, yes. That was people who — who got the land as a prize for fighting the Russians in a 1920 war.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: So how come your father didn’t get any?
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: Well, we didn’t need it. He was an officer, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: Okay. But he fought in the 1920 war.
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   A: Yeah, but he —
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   Q: He was fine as an officer.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: Okay. Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   A: Work on land is — is a—1s a hard work.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: It’s true.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: It’s not — not easy. And by the way, that’s how my parents treated help. Thi — this woman that worked for us, when my father was in prison, she too-took parcels to him. So evidently, they were good employers.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: That means something, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: Except one thing I couldn’t reconcile, because she wrote to us in Russia, a letter, in 1940, in December. She says that she — she — she passed the parcel to — to my father, and at that time, he wasn’t there. So evidently those — those prison officials took the parcel and told her he is there, but I’m sure he wasn’t there, because it was December of 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: And when was Katyn?
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: It was in May.
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: It was in May, so th-th — the —
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: But when you were taken to the train, did you think your father still was in prison, locally?
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: I thought so, because they screened the windows in prison. They put the screens over there, see? So they didn’t want — of course, that was April. They didn’t want to see those people that people were being reported. But that was in April. TheyJanuary 31, 2015 probably went to Katyn later that month, or beginning of May. Because the order to execute those people was signed on my birthday, March the fifth.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: Yeah. And Stalin died on March the fifth. Good present for me. ...
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: Okay, so you get to the train. Tell me what — how many people were in that cart, along with your things?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: About 60.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: In that lorry? Or in the train? In the train?
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: No, no, the car.
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: In the car train, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: So were — what did it look like inside?
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: There was no toilet, there was a hole in the floor of the — of the wagon, of the car. And —
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: Where did people sleep?
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: Oh, the — oh, on the [indecipherable] It’s like a wooden floors.
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: Like platforms, or something?
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   A: Yeah, yeah, that’s —
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: Like bunkbeds?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: Not beds, but yeah. So, that was a three weeks trip.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: Well, tell me about those bunkbeds first. About how many people would be on one platform?
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Oh, probably eight, or so. And they were like three story deep — high, and —
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: Three levels high?
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: So there were three of them? Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: Yeah, about eight or nine. So — and there were about four of them that way, so it’s about 60 people, like I say. I never counted them, but —
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: Did you know anybody who was on that train? Did you recognize them?
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: Yes. There was a [bell ringing] —
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: — my father’s friend, so after my father was arrested, and this guy was arrested — [coughs] Excuse me.
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: That’s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: So that his wife and his daughter moved with us, and the daughter was about year older than — than I was, I guess, and we were pretty good companions. So they — but later they moved out, but somehow they got deported same day, too.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: Okay.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: So, the officers’ families were deported on the April the 13".
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: So that was the category for that deportation.
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: Yeah. Policemen, officers, and high — high government officials. That was the 13". Later, there was another deportation in June. That was from towns again. But February 10", it was strictly from — from villages.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: I see. So, where did all your things go? All those things that you brought with you? Did they go in the middle of that cattle car, or something?
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: And did anybody take them? I mean, did people steal it on the — you know, steal an —
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: They couldn’t steal that, the doors were locked all the time, so no, no way to steal them. I don’t know how they — don’t remember how they treated my dog over there, because there was a dog, too.
  </p>
  <p id="524">
   Q: Was it the only dog in the cattle car?
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: And did the dog survive the journey?
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   A: It did. But didn’t survive Siberia. Those big Russian Huskies killed him.
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   Q: So tell me about the beginning of the journey.
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   A: Well — January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   Q: Did you see anything — did you — were you near a window? Were there any windows?
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: No windows. They would open the door once a day and give some hot water and clothes, on the floo — on the February 10" they were opening more often, to throw out the dead bodies. But you know, weather was pretty good in — in April, so it took about three weeks, then we got to this nation there.
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: I still want to talk about the journey a little bit. Do you remember leaving Poland? Did people know when they were leaving Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: What do you mean? What people?
  </p>
  <p id="534">
   Q: Well, the people in the train. You were on a train, the doors are closed —
  </p>
  <p id="535">
   A: Oh — oh yeah, they we — they — they — they knew, because we had to change the cars, because Poland had a w-wider, or not narrower rails. So they had to s-switch the cars.
  </p>
  <p id="536">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="537">
   A: So-
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   Q: So also the — there was a delay.
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: And that’s when you knew you were leaving Polish territory.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: There was Szepetéwka, there was — that’s as far as we went on the Polish, and then they switched to the Russian cars.
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   Q: The — the place was called Szepetowka’?
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: Yeah. That — that was where the rail would stop.
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   Q: And were the doors open during this time, or were they still closed as the —
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   A: Closed. All the time they were closed. That the — they open them when we are moving from one car to the other.
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   Q: And did people react to this, that is, when they realized they are leaving Poland, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   A: Yeah, they were singing, you know, religious songs, and patriotic songs and so on. That’s about it.
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   Q: What — how was your mother on this train? Was she quieter, was she still angry, was she —
  </p>
  <p id="549">
   A: Well, she didn’t have nobody to argue with, there were [indecipherable]. Yeah, so that —
  </p>
  <p id="550">
   Q: But you said her health wasn’t that great.
  </p>
  <p id="551">
   A: Well, she had a, I guess, heart condition. But maybe part of it was in her mind, too, because what they say, that lot of people, when they went to Siberia, all of aJanuary 31, 2015 sudden they got well. You know, going to the doctors all the time in Poland, while they were in Siberia, the sickness disappeared. So —
  </p>
  <p id="552">
   Q: And what about you? Do you remember how you were feeling?
  </p>
  <p id="553">
   A: Well, as I said in — I, from the very beginning — for example, after my father was arrested, I used to go with this girl, you know, go play. And I didn’t think much of it. | mean, I was sorry they arrested him. I didn’t think, you know, he’d be killed, but — but all my life I have everything took in stride, because I figured well, it’s not going to help me if I am going to despair and stuff like that. Is going to make things worse. So, I was on the train, doing nothing, like most of the people. They were singing, and so on.
  </p>
  <p id="554">
   Q: Was it that you were trying to keep yourself from being sad?
  </p>
  <p id="555">
   A: Oh, as I said, you know, usually I — I take things 1n stride. It’s — I lost my father when I was 11, mother when was 17, and —
  </p>

   A: Picking up the wheat, or something like that. And then my mother said, I’m a nurse. I want to work as a nurse. And again they told her [speaks Russian] cannot be a nurse, because they’re going in to cure patients. So, with her fluent Russian, they made her supervisor for that whole group of people who are working there —
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   Q: My God.
  </p>

But — so we were burning this stuff, and in the wintertime it’s [indecipherable] just sitting around, and burning in a s-s — in a furnace — there was no coal, but I don’t know how to explain it, it’s a cow’s —

  </p>
  <p id="662">
   Q: Now, the fe — now, were you still living in the same room as the woman and her manager of the estate?
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   A: No, no, we moved to the private — private house over there. I don’t know how it happened. Evidently, my mother went to the city hall and got this — this room over there.
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   Q: I don’t speak much Russian, just a few words, but when you describe your mother, there’s a phrase in Russian which comes to me, which is wot(ph) Zhenshchina.

  <p id="665">
   A: Oh yeah, what a woman.
  </p>
  <p id="666">
   Q: What a woman, what a woman.
  </p>
  <p id="667">
   A: Yeah, that’s right, yeah. So evidently she — she went over there and they gave her this room in this — but next door was some guy from Asia, I think, Uzbek or something. It could be Kazakhstan, this part of Russia, I don’t know. But —
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: Well, do you remember what the house looked like? Was it — how it was built? Was it wood, was it stone, was it mud?
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: Well, it was more or less wooden, yeah. But there was electricity.
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   Q: Oh.January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="671">
   A: And thankfully so, because my mother went someplace, and that storm came, that snowstorm, which really, she had to crawl on the ground, but she saw the light in our window over there, and she crawled all the way to that house. But, for example, wa — one woman who lived in different building, she — she went to buy milk for her daughter, that storm caught her, they found her in the spring, clinging to that tel — to — to the telephone pole.
  </p>
  <p id="672">
   Q: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="673">
   A: Fortunately, she had the mother with her, so grandmother took care of that —

   Q: Daughter.
  </p>
  <p id="675">
   A: — little girl.
  </p>
  <p id="676">
   Q: Yeah. Did many people die in the sovkhoz, of the deportees?
  </p>
  <p id="677">
   A: Not too many. I know this one colonel’s wife, she died on the Christmas eve, and th-th-they were joking that they’re making Wigilia, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="678">
   Q: Christmas eve dinner, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   A: — dinner, and she’s supposed to get some mushrooms from the suitcase, and she leave to get us mushrooms, and she drop dead. So they said probably she was sorry for those mushrooms, that she has to give those mushrooms. But yes, she — she — and the — late — later on, when we moved to Uzbekistan, this — another young man January 31, 2015 died, but not too many died over there. And for example, in the sovkhoz, I never saw u— Russian soldier.
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   Q: I was — that was my next question. How much — how much was there interaction with any authorities, any Soviet authority?
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   A: Chief of the sovkhoz maybe, but when I was two years in — 1n Siberia, I never seen Russian soldier, never. And I read those stories in that book what I gave you, some people say they were guarding them, and stuff like that. Didn’t happen to us. Probably that bochinkow(ph), he was politic —
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: Yeah, political officer.
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: Yeah. But he was a nice man.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: The one who did business with you.
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   Q: These are things are so interesting. You know, there’s — there’s the — the official stories, and then there’s what really happens, you know’?
  </p>
  <p id="687">
   A: You know, I hate to say, but we had all this stuff that we took — took from Poland, because sometimes you couldn’t buy anything with money, was all with trade, barter. But, as I lits — other peoples’ stories, hunger and so on, I cannot say that about us.
  </p>
  <p id="688">
   Q: You had enough to eat, do you think?January 31, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   A: Yeah, most of the time. I think I was very hungry maybe two days out of those two years. But what I explained that my mother did so, so good, you know, over the —her lifetime, so maybe somebody was watching over us.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   Q: You never know, you never know. Then tell me, what was the hardest part of being there?
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   A: Hardest part of being there ... was pretty boring. Boredom.
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: Was there a school?
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: Yeah, there was a school, but my mother didn’t want to send me to Russian school. She was afraid they may convert me, which would never happen. So she told them that I don’t have shoes, and the board of education says they don’t have in the budget money f— to buy stuff for the shoes. So I wasn’t going to school, which was a big mistake, because I could learn s-something. Th-Th — they had a good level math in Russian schools, and of course I learned Russians at home, because lot of those Russians officers came to Poland after Bolshevik revolution. As a matter of fact, we lived block and a half for Gagarina, who was a princess. They said that Gagarin was her nephew, or —
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: Oh, you mean the astronaut — the cosmonaut was her nephew”?
  </p>
  <p id="695">

  <p id="698">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="699">
   A: So, they used to come to our house, and of course they didn’t speak Polish, but my parents speak Russian, so they were talking in Russian all the time. And you know, eight year old, nine year old kid, picks it up like that. So my parents realized that I understood everything, so if they wanted to say something that I don’t — wouldn’t understand, they switched to German, because Russian I understood everything. Even now I understand everything in Russian, my — 1-if I took a brush- up course, probably that would came back to me, the Russian language.

  <p id="700">
   Q: So, did you have to work as well, or were you to — considered too young to work?

You’ve painted a wonderful picture, in words, of at least a little part of what you had been through. And Id say that, with that, this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial January 31, 2015 Museum interview with Mr. Eugeniusz Chmielowski, on January 31“, 2015, in Chicago. Thank you again.
