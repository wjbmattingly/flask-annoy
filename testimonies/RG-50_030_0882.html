   Q: So you would see news films while you were in the cinema?
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   A: Yes. They were — they were special films just with news.
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: Okay. And what are some of the things that would stand out to you?
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   A: Everything was so foreign. This physical thing, this marching, and yelling, and this boasting of how good they were, and — and the sports, and — and then things were forbidden, and then we couldn’t go to the movies, we couldn’t sit on park benches. We had — have you ever heard in your interviews, about the Kulturbund?
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: Tell me about it.
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   A: When we couldn’t go to the theater any more, or to the concerts, Jewish theater started to come — got into existence.
  </p>
  <p id="442">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="443">
   A: And it was called the Kulturbund.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: Culture bund. And my parents, of course, were members of it, and my sister and I would go to all these performances. They were all done by Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: And were they in sp — different places —
  </p>
  <p id="447">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   Q: — the performances?

   A: Yes, they were in theaters, and — June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   Q: So they were able to rent out space in different theaters?
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: I don’t know the — all the background of those things.
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   Q: No, no, but you —
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="454">
   Q: Okay. And did the behavior of your teachers change, in school?
  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: By that time we were out of it. We — we — we couldn’t go to school any more.
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: When did that — when did that happen, that you couldn’t go to school any more?
  </p>
  <p id="457">
   A: I think I was 16.
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   Q: So, that would have been 1936.
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   Q: And what happened with your father’s business after 1933?
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: For several years he kept it, and then — then the Nazis took it.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: I see, so —
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: And when he — and when he came to this country, they got Wiedergutmachung, you know what that is?
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Reparations?
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: Okay. But that’s a lot later, isn’t it?
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: Yes, of course. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: Okay. So I still want to get a sense of this life in Berlin in the 1930s. Did you see Brownshirts walking down the street?
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: Were they near your home’?
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: No. Did you ever feel harassed in school, when you were still in school?
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: I was out then.
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: But when you say, I was out, there were still some years after Hitler was in power —
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: — before you were out, and th —
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: No, I didn’t feel anything particular.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: Okay, so your teachers were not cruel?
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: And the fellow students did not —
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: — behave differently? https://collections.ushmm.org June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: No, that happens later. Some of my friends wouldn’t talk to me any more.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: And that was after you had already left school?
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: It’s so hard to separate it exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Okay. Then it doesn’t matter. It doesn — in — in that sense, it doesn’t matter. It — what I’m after is, the incidents where you experienced them not speaking to you any more, can you tell us more about that?
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: It was just — we didn’t — we didn’t stay in the same places, we just — they didn’t walk where I walked, and —
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: Would you see th —
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: — they wouldn’t make any attempt to contact me.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: As a matter of fact, I was on a business trip with my husband, to Germany from here, and I used the bathroom at the bed and breakfast. There was a magazine rack. And one of the girls that had been my friend, and was in school with me, had become a very famous actress.
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: No kidding?
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: I saw her picture. And so, somebody asked me, did you contact her? It had gone through my mind, and then I decided not to do it, because I didn’t want to be rejected. I didn’t know how she felt. https://collections.ushmm.org June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: What year was this that you were in Germany, and you saw the picture in the magazine rack? Was this several decades after the war?
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: Seventies, 80s?
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: Probably around that time.
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: Okay, okay. And so you never did contact her?
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: Did the rejection ever come in a very obvious way?
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: No, it was subtle. But you know, this is part of my upbringing. My parents instilled a spirit in us that, no matter what happens to you, you’re still yourself. You don’t lose yourself, you don’t lose your value. And that’s what kept us going.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: Those are very important lessons.
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Yes, very.
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: You know.
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: And so I’m — you know, we’re so fortunate. Not every child has that.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: That’s right, that’s right, th — the — you know, as we grow up, part of our answer to, am I worth anything, is your mirror to the world, and how the world reacts to you.
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: Yeah. https://collections.ushmm.org June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: And at some point, in growth, you have to come to a realization that you have value, despite how the world reacts to you. And that’s something —
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: — you’re saying your parents stres — stressed.
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: By example. Not by lecturing.
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: It — it helped me when I came to this country, which is, of course, much later, and we may come to that.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: Yes, yes. So, did your level of living change much in 1933 to °36, those first years of Hitler being in power?
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: It did later on, yes, because for instance, you couldn’t have a maid any more, that was under 45, because that’s when those — when they couldn’t have children any more, and they didn’t want to work for Jews. So we had a part time maid, over 46.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: I see. I see.
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: And our apartment was smaller by then, because my mother couldn’t take care of anything big. And I guess the money wasn’t there either, I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: Okay. Were your parents less — how was their manor? Did their manor change, as time went on? Were they less happy? Were they more worried?
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   A: Not to — they didn’t show it to us. And it came out when they — when we left. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: Tell me about that.
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: Well, it’s a really a long story, I —
  </p>
  <p id="524">
   Q: Please, please.
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: Please.
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   A: By that time it was later on, and I did not want to stay in Germany. I could see what was happening. My father kept saying, you don’t have to worry. I’m — I was a — I have the Iron Cross, I was in the army. They’re not going to do anything to me. But, course that changed after Crystal Night.
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   Q: Okay, so you were still in Berlin during Kristallnacht?
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   A: I was still in — yes, I was. But before that, what happened — no, th — I don’t — happened around that time, I wanted to go — I wanted to leave so badly. And I was a stamp collector at the time. One Sunday afternoon I was looking at my stamps, and I found an envelope that my uncle had given me, that came from America, and it had an American stamp on it, addressed to him, and he gave it to me because I — he knew I was collecting stamps. So, he happened to be in our house that Sunday, and I went in there, and I said, who are these people that wrote to you from America? And he said, that’s my — cousin of mine. And I asked him about the details, this couple, they had no children. He was American, and she came — had come fromJune 8, 2016 Germany. So | said, would you please write to them and see if they would give us an affidavit? And he did write to them, and he did give us an affidavit, my sister — for my sister and me.
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   Q: And this is in what year?
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: It was probably about — it was around °38.
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: Okay. Before Kristallnacht. Because that’s November ’38.
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: I know. I know.
  </p>
  <p id="534">
   Q: Oh, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="535">
   A: And I’m — I’m trying to pinpoint it, and I have not been able to — to get the — give the exact date.
  </p>
  <p id="536">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="537">
   A: Well, when the affidavit came, you have a quota number. And it was a very high number, there were a lot of people ahead of us. So I said to him — my father, I said, I don’t want to stay and wait here and maybe not get out. He had a friend in London, and that friend had a friend — an English friend, who was in amer — who was a Quaker, a British Quaker. And he told him — he said to my father’s friend, we’ve been thinking what we can do for German Jews, and maybe this is something we can do. Maybe we can take one of them. And it so happened — you know, life is so strange that way — so happened that an American qua — the head of the AmericanJune 8, 2016 Quaker was visiting that friend — that man in London, at the time, Dr. Balderson(ph). And he was on the way to Germany to find out what was happening. And so Mr. — the English Quaker said to him, would you investigate that family, and see if we can take one of those girls? And he did, and I remember when he came to our house, Dr. Balderson(ph) —
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   Q: Dr. Borgussen(ph)?
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: Balderson(ph), b-a-l —
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: Oh, Balderson(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: Yeah, Balderson(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   Q: Balderson(ph), mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: And he came on a Sunday, and we — we had already learned English in school, and my mother spoke a little bit. So she made coffee, and we talked. And later on he went back and he told them that our family was fine. So they said they would take one of us.
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   Q: Did your sister want to go as much as you did?
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   A: I guess. I think. Well, we were a pair, anyway. So we send — we wrote to them, and we sent our pictures, both of us. And as they told us later one when they saw the picture, they said, we can’t take one, we have to take them both. So we got ready to go. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   A: And I'd like to tell you the process of what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   Q: Please, please.
  </p>
  <p id="549">
   A: Everything we took — somebody came from the government, and everything we took, he marked down, and we had — my parents had to pay the government the worth of that particular article that we took. In money.
  </p>
  <p id="550">
   Q: Even when you owned it?
  </p>
  <p id="551">
   A: We owned.
  </p>
  <p id="552">
   Q: You owned the article, and yet, if you want —
  </p>
  <p id="553">
   A: And yet — and yet, they had to pay the amount that article was worth.
  </p>
  <p id="554">
   Q: What did you — do you remember what it is that you actually took with you?
  </p>
  <p id="555">
   A: Well, we took all — yes, we took our clothes, of course, and we did manage — my sister took a sewing machine. And we took a few little gadgets. We took, I think a small rug, and — and some vases, you know, few little items.
  </p>
  <p id="556">
   Q: Household items type things.
  </p>
  <p id="557">
   A: We — this is another thing that I would like to talk about, is how the process was.
  </p>
  <p id="558">
   Q: Yes, tell me.
  </p>
  <p id="559">
   A: And what [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="560">
   Q: Okay, please tell me. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="561">
   A: You may have heard this before, but I think it repeats — most people here, Americans, do not know this. You know, it got worse every year.
  </p>
  <p id="562">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   A: And people are wondering, how do — did they know which stores were Jewish, and how could they know which glasses to break. Well, one year there was a law that all Jews had to take — all female Jews had to take the name Sarah, and all male had to take the name ...
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   Q: Israel.
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   A: Is — I forgot [indecipherable] for a minute. Anyway, they had to take these two names. The following year there was a law, all Jewish stores had to write their names on the outside of the windows. You see the connection?
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   Q: So if your — if your name —
  </p>
  <p id="567">
   A: If you had a Jewish store, your Jewish name was on the outside, on the window. It was painted on there.
  </p>
  <p id="568">
   Q: Where were you during Kristallnacht?
  </p>
  <p id="569">
   A: My sister and I were home with my father. My mother was in Breslau, visiting her mother.

  </p>
  <p id="574">
   Q: Did anyone come to your apartment?
  </p>
  <p id="575">
   A: I did — I’m going to tell you about that. My father went to somebody’s house where they had already been, and taken the man. So he went there.
  </p>
  <p id="576">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   A: My father was never taken.

  </p>
  <p id="588">
   Q: You saw the burning?
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   A: Yeah. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   Q: Were you afraid for your own life, at that point?
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   A: No, I— I— you know, we — when you’ re that young, you don’t think of it. And we were young young. We were quite — you know, we were very protected all our lives.
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   Q: And so, Mr. Balderson(ph) visited you after Kristallnacht?
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   A: I think it was after Kristallnacht, I think so. I’m not sure.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="598">
   Q: You say, first of all, there was the inventory of your things.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   A: You know, can you imagine parents sending their two daughters away’? Not a tear, nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   A: They never — they never showed us anything. But from the minute we left, there was only one thing on our minds, to get them out. That was the only thing we ever wanted.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   Q: Did you go by train? June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   A: Yeah, my father said flying was too dangerous. So we went — we had to cross a channel, with a boat, and we were so seasick. And then when we got to the station in England, I remember the first word Dr. Balderson(ph) said to us. Ah, not — not Dr. Balderson(ph), the other one. Who’s who? Who’s who? We lived in London for a few more months, and they were building a home in Sussex, and that’s where we moved then, later. And this we were when war broke out. Then — so we thought we'd never see them again. But we did.

  <p id="635">
   A: But then war broke out, and they did not bargain to have us there for a long, long time. So they send me to his sister, to be a maid there.

  </p>
  <p id="638">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="639">
   A: So, I was up there, and then I was a maid. And I don’t think I was a very good maid, because I’d never done that stuff before. I did the best I could, and they were very nice to me. And my sister got a job on the same street where they lived in — in their new house. They were two women lived together, and she was a housekeeper there.

   Q: Did you feel unwelcome?
  </p>
  <p id="643">
   A: No. No, but we understood that, you know, that the — wouldn’t do that. We were just grateful that they did what they wa — did. And they were wonderful to us. But then, fortunately, my American visa — our American visa came through first.

  <p id="644">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="645">
   A: So, for a while I stayed with a relative in London, our relative. My sister’s cousin — my — my — my mother’s cousin.

So our ship collided with a Canadian troop transport, on the first night out.
  </p>
  <p id="646">
   Q: Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="647">
   A: And we — they sounded the alarm during the night, and we had to go onboard deck, and my sister and I didn’t know if we had to go back to Germany. We were scared.

   Q: You would ha — why would you have to go back to Germany’ June 8, 2016

  </p>
  <p id="658">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="659">
   A: And then I lived in New York for 17 years, and loved every minute of it.
  </p>
  <p id="660">
   Q: I can understand that. Who met you at the pier?
  </p>
  <p id="661">
   A: One of my father’s friends, who had already immigrated. Took us to his house on Washington Heights, on Thayer Street, and we spend three nights there, and then we both started jobs in the same building, as maids. And that’s what I’m ta — June 8, 2016 maid — we knew who we were wor — who we were. We did not act like that, we — we — we did what we supposed to do as maids, but we remained the same inside.
  </p>
  <p id="662">
   Q: Was it hard to do that?
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   A: No. It was hard in a way, yes, but we were happy that we were here, and that we maybe could do something to get our parents out.
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   Q: Were you well treated in the places you worked?
  </p>
  <p id="665">
   A: I was treated like a maid. My sister was not.
  </p>
  <p id="666">
   Q: Okay. And did you know what was going on with your parents?
  </p>
  <p id="667">
   A: Oh, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: How?
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: Occasionally, a letter would come, and we were in touch, we were trying to ge — we were trying everything to get them out. What finally happened is — oh, my father had somehow managed to send us some money, not much, but few dollars here and there. And we made 35 dollars a month. Thirty dollars went in the bank, so that’s 60 for the two of us, and five dollars we kept.
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   Q: So, it was 35 dollars each, per month, or — or —
  </p>
  <p id="671">
   A: Each, yeah.

  <p id="672">
   Q: Each.

   Q: Thirty dollars each, and you kept five.
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   Q: And what was going on with your parents at the time?
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   A: All right. They were — they didn’t tell us too much, but they were alive, and they were still in their apartment. And we tried everything.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: What does that mean, everything?
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: We tried to get them out, t-talked to different people, and finally ended up buying a visa for Santo Domingo, which they told us was illegal, but we couldn’t get anything else, and we were able to pay for it. Then they — they ha-had to get there. So they were able to buy a ticket to — through Russia, in a closed train, they couldn’t get out, and into Yokohama. So that’s a long trip.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: So they — from Berlin —
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: Yes.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="687">

  <p id="690">
   Q: Okay, do you know where they went? Where the stops of their vary — from Berlin —

   A: I do not.
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: I do not. But then, when they got to Yokohama, they had to take a small boat to go over Panama, and San Domingo. Stopped up in America on — on the west coast there. And when they got to Panama, there was a shipping strike, and they couldn’t go any further. And my sister and I went — we went — we ever — went all over, to try and get some money to buy a plane ticket, and finally got some from a Jewish mi — organization. We send them the money, and they flew to the — they flew to Santo Domingo.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: And then — so they flew from Panama to Santo Domingo, and then what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: And then they stayed there for a few weeks, few months, and then they came here. June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: And there was no difficulty visa-wise from them, to go from Santo Domingo to

  <p id="716">
   Q: What job did you then change to?
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: I—I still was a maid, but I had some terrible experiences there, too, but anyway, that wasn’t — that’s not too important. And then, when they ge — got here, I quit.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: Okay. So, how did your parents get on their feet? Were they able to take anything out of Germany with them?
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: My — my mother only — she’d arrived only six months here when she died. She picked up something on the way. And her luggage never came until she — after she had gone.

  <p id="844">
   Q: Did he describe working in intelligence?
  </p>
  <p id="845">
   A: Yes, he did. And he was stationed right near where he came from. So he met some of the people that he knew.
  </p>
  <p id="846">
   Q: Germans?
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   A: Yes, he met somebody that he went in school with. And he found out that a friend had been killed by the Russians. So he was very, you know, mixed feelings.
  </p>
  <p id="848">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   A: He almost got shot once. He had gotten lost, and when he was going back to his American troop, they asked him about a sports person. And he had never heard of him, because he was new in America, and they almost shot him because he had a German accent.
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   Q: Oh my goodness. The kinds of adventures people have, you know? Unexpected ones. And he happened to then be part of the liberating force of —
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   A: Outho — Mauthausen.
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   Q: The sub-camp of Mauthausen.

  <p id="856">
   Q: — I think you — you —
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   Q: — mentioned before. Did you ever go back to Berlin?
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: No. I-
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   Q: Did you ever go back to Breslau?
  </p>
  <p id="861">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="862">
   Q: Or Germany? June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="863">
   A: Yes. I didn’t want to go. My husband always took me on his business trips. But when he said he was going to Germany, I said I’m not going. But two weeks before he left, I changed my mind, and I went.
  </p>
  <p id="864">
   Q: And what was it like for you?
  </p>
  <p id="865">
   A: It wasn’t easy.
  </p>
  <p id="866">
   Q: Where were you in Germany?
  </p>
  <p id="867">
   A: We were in southern Germany. You know, I had the hate. But I went to a lecture once, somebody who had also been in Germany, and he said he had that hate, and it destroyed him, and so he became — he — he changed. And so, I changed. Every once in a while it would come through, but I— I was a happier person after that.
  </p>
  <p id="868">
   Q: How do you change this?
  </p>
  <p id="869">
   A: I reasoned with myself. People who are alive now, were not Nazis, they weren’t even born yet. So how could I hate them?
  </p>
  <p id="870">
   Q: It worked?
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: It worked. Most of the time, let me put it that way. Sometimes still came through. But not — I wasn’t unreasonable any more.
  </p>
  <p id="872">
   Q: When you came to the United States, did you ever still speak German with anybody? June 8, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   A: My sister.
  </p>
  <p id="874">
   Q: Do you still today?
  </p>
  <p id="875">
   A: And my — my d— my older daughter speaks it. No, not to — not too much. But my in-laws were from Germany, my first in-laws, and my second ones, too. And — and we would speak German when Elaine wasn’t supposed to hear what we were saying. So she went to her grandma, and she said, Mom, will you teach me German? And she — my mother-in-law, who was an angel, she said — she said, I don’t know how to teach, but Pll only speak German to you from now on. And she did, and that’s how she learned German. Then, when this daughter got married — was getting married, she took her a-and her future husband to meet my mother-in- law. And my mother-in-law started speaking German — speaking English with him. So Elaine said, Mama, I thought you — you always spoke German with me, I didn’t know you could speak English. And she said, what do you think, I’m an idiot?

  </p>
  <p id="882">

  </p>
  <p id="884">

  <p id="885">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="886">
   Q: And when was that?
  </p>
  <p id="887">
   A: I didn’t want to be German any more, as soon as I cro-crossed that border.
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: When you were in England —
  </p>
  <p id="889">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="890">
   Q: — in other words. When you crossed the boat, or you crossed the border from — from Germany into another —
  </p>
  <p id="891">
   A: Yeah, I wasn’t — I was — didn’t want anything German any more. By the way, crossing that border wasn’t easy.
  </p>
  <p id="892">
   Q: Tell me about it.
  </p>
  <p id="893">
   A: We were on the train, going through Holland. And as we came to the border of Germany and Holland, they took us out of the train, and they investigated us, and they talked at us, and they — the pictures — little picture of us we had in our https://collections.ushmm.org June 8, 2016 pocketbooks — we had a little suitcase, overnight suitcase between us, and they kept asking questions, and being nasty.
  </p>
  <p id="894">
   Q: This is the German side?
  </p>
  <p id="895">
   A: Yes. And — and of course, the train left. So here we were, in a small, little town, and no place will — we didn’t know anybody. There was one family that took in some Jews, but they were already sleeping on the floor, there were so many of them. So finally they got us into an old, rickety hotel on the back stairs, going up to some room, and there were mice there, it was terrible. Every time my sister was going to go to sleep, I said, there’s a mice. So, it was —
  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: Was the rest of your luggage on that train that left, or were —
  </p>
  <p id="897">
   A: They had sent it ahead of us.
  </p>

   Q: I see.
  </p>

  <p id="908">

  </p>
  <p id="910">
   Q: Is there anything I haven’t asked today that you’d like to — that you’d like to add to what we’ve talked about?
  </p>
