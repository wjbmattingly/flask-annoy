  <p id="54">
   Q: What were your feelings in the beginning when you first came back to school and you had to stay in the back of the classroom? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 8

   A: I didn’t understand.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Were you frightened? Do you remember being frightened?
  </p>
  <p id="57">

  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: Oh I’m sure not. I’m sure we were frightened now that you get to it. I’m afraid we didn’t have to talk because immediately we realized that 1t was dangerous to walk in the streets. That —
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: How did you know this? You’re 12 years old right?

   Q: Physically attacking?
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: Yes, I mean my sister who was four years younger, they spat in her face and pulled her by the pigtails and then there were big signs on the benches saying no Jews allowed and we were not allowed in the parks overnight. So this all happened really very quickly. https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 9
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: And what is the reaction of a 12 year old child to this? Is it something you talked about with your parents?
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Oh, we talked about it but we just existed from day to day and watched what was going on. Our maid was leaving. She wasn’t allowed to work for Jews anymore. And we got somebody who had already been a refugee from some other part of Austria.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: This was a relative who came to your house you mean?
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: No this was a poor soul who had a sister and a father and they were, they came from Klagenfurt which is the provinces and they had been chased out the very day that Hitler arrived. And all she could do to get food on the table was do domestic work so she came to us. And a very sad soul whom I remember to this day. And then my father —
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: How did she know you all?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Oh she didn’t know us. My mother somehow -- recommendations. I don’t know, somebody recommended a needy case. My mother was always ready for needy cases. And my father —
  </p>
  <p id="74">

  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: I probably, I had heard of it but it didn’t affect me. I mean it didn’t hit home.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: Had you ever heard him speak over the radio before 38 any of his speech —
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: I remember sitting in the living room with my parents, listening to the radio but I didn’t take it seriously. I was 11.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: I was going to say, you were a child. https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 10
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: I was 11 and, when they marched in and I was even younger before. When it began.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: So that’s when the big change happened at the Anschluss. Did you see Hitler at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: I never saw him.
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: You never saw him.
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: No but I saw the guy you know the SS and I saw them marching in front of my windows and screaming and you know that was immediate. The night that he marched in, we still had the gentile woman working for us and my parents happened to be at the theater that night and weren’t home. And it was very frightening, hordes and hordes of people marching in front of the windows. And you know my sister was even younger. She was seven so.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: How did your nursemaid, governess, handle that?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: That was actually the maid and that wasn’t our governess and she didn’t handle it all that well. And when my parents came home, they found that the gas was on. So she didn’t stay with us much longer. But it could have, if they hadn’t come home when they did, god knows what would have happened.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: Right. What was it like to see these soldiers marching and hear the sound of the boots and things like that?
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: That was frightening.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: What about, did the swastika have any meaning to you? At that time?
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: It conveyed a lot of enthusiasm of the masses from which I was excluded. That’s what you https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 11 know, it didn’t quite hit me just what they were doing. Yeah, that they were going to kill my grandparents and everybody else.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: The Anschluss happens and then and you go to school and you have to stay in the back of the room and then what was the next development?
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: The next development was we were told that we, in my school that, 1t was a gymnasium, an academic gymnasium, that we could not continue there. That the school was closed down. And that only the top students in the city would be allowed to enroll in the one Jewish gymnasium that existed.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: But the gymnasium you were in was not a Jewish —
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: No, but women’s, you know not institution but a women’s school. So they had to qualify for that other gymnasium with grades and so forth and I did qualify and I was accepted to it so I was happy that I could continue my academic education. And my sister was younger so she —
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: She was in the earlier school?
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Yeah and that could continue til fourth grade. So there was no issue. I went to that school in September in 1938 but it really didn’t have the greatest effect on my life, except that I felt good about being there because we left you know several months later. You know four months later.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: With your relationship with your parents, did they talk over as things were —
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: They were very supportive all the way whether here or in Cuba or anywhere else. It was fantastic when I think about it.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: But I meant when you were younger, before you left Austria, were they open with you in discussing what was happening? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 12
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: They didn’t hide it. I didn’t feel that they hid anything, were hiding that. It couldn’t be hidden. It couldn’t. They were open I think. Maybe not completely. I mean we were children. I just can’t gauge that.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: But you weren’t allowed to go out on the street then?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: By myself, anyway. And we were, you know I was afraid to be. And going away in the summer and for instance on the ski trip that, with the school that was just the week before March in where you could, there you could feel the Nazism in the mountains. It was completely so.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: How did you feel that, in what sense?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: You just felt it, that we were surrounded by enemies. And the amazing thing is we were on the slopes and it was a second year gymnasium which is the sixth grade class. Skiing and on the slope with us was the Duke of Windsor who had just abdicated I think or something. He was in the process of marrying her, the Duchess of Windsor. But anyway, we felt it there. I mean totally because we stayed at the type of place that you know in the mountains where there were no Jews. It was obvious that it was their town.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: You yourself didn’t experience any direct anti-Semitic —
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: Well it was coming pretty soon. I mean my father’s business.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: What happened with that?
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: That, a commissar was put in which meant that he oversaw the whole business and eventually it was taken over and he had a lot of good friends among the gentiles who suddenly became big shots in the Nazi party. But so I think that he was somewhat — he was somewhat in better shape by some unseen protection you know. But so that, the business was going and what else. How did — https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 13
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Do you know if they had any, if your father or mother had any relation or communication with their families in the other, you know far away?
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: Well that, they immediately tried to get us out. I mean they knew we had to leave. So —
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: To go into the countryside you mean?
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: No, no, to go abroad. Is that what you’re asking?
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: No I was asking, your relatives you said were not in Vienna.
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: No, they offered to take us into Poland. My father didn’t think that was a good move.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: Right. Ok.
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: So we didn’t move. He wrote to relatives in other countries.
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   Q: So that’s when he started to write to —
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   A: Yes, immediately. So they wrote to Palestine and to the United States and I had some cousins in Palestine and his brother and the cousin didn’t answer and my sister years later said it’s a good thing. But anyway so didn’t answer. I had cousins in New York who did answer.
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: Who did answer.
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: Did answer and who you know gave us an affidavit and helped us elaborate the roads through Cuba and all that.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: At that point, what did America mean to you, as a 12 year old? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 14
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: An unknown promised land.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: But something very positive?
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: Yes, yes. I had met actually those relatives were on their honeymoon in Vienna a couple of years before and other people too and whom, you know it sounded like an unknown wonderful place.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Your father got papers, got the affidavits from the New York —
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: From the family in New York, in New York. And then there was another issue that, you know the Kristallnacht. You know that. So do you want the sequence was that they came to our house and they went from door to door and took out all the men from the whole building. You know and they came to our door. They read the name. The name is Schachter and somebody gave the order, skip that door.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: Oh?
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: So they skipped our door and went on and we could hear the screams in the streets and could hear the glass breaking and everything else but we were saved for the night.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Do you know how that happened?
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: No, I never found out but we were sitting in the ante room, the large ante room, actually waiting to be invaded and my father said would you like me to go out so that we get it then over with. And so we said no. And that’s when they skipped us and, but we could hear everything and I’ve never forgotten it. In the streets and then after Kristallnacht when the others were transported you know to god knows what destinations. My father was contacted by some Aryan friend of his or formerly friends and now Aryan. But they were still friendly and was told that he had to leave the country by December 31“', 38. Otherwise that nobody could vouch for anything. That wasn’t likely to leave. https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 15 Anyway so they intensified their efforts to get the exit possibilities and the, so America was so, I mean the United States was the possibility. But we also needed a document called an unbedankleischtide [ph] to get out of the country which had to be gotten from the Nazis and which wasn’t available so quickly. We might not have it by December 31“. So we decided, my parents decided to split the family up. And so that my father and my little sister who was adorable would go on New Year’s Eve and try and cross the border because the guards would be drunk. They thought. And we would stay and wait for the paper and then see if we could exit properly and perhaps ship some of our stuff overseas and so await us later on. At any rate they did proceed accordingly. In the meanwhile the people from -- the cousins helped us get a visa into Cuba, which was obtainable at that point by depositing $500 per person as a guarantee in Cuba and sending us tickets to go to Cuba. And —
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: This was your American cousin who told you.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: What were their names?
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: Their name was Max and Ida Rothschild. They lived in Great Neck. And so they, it was my father’s first cousin. Anyway they, where was I. They arranged for the Cuba. So my sister and my father got through. They were drunk and they went, it’s really amazing, to Switzerland and then went on to England, very soon after, with the idea that we would join them in England, where we had very good friends.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: How did he stay in contact with your mother?
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: Well we didn’t -- I mean there wasn’t much time involved. And we left two weeks later. It so happened.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: No, once he left your house and got over, do you know how he stayed in contact with — https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 16
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: I don’t know. I don’t know. But, when they got to England they called us for sure. I don’t know. I just don’t know. Anyway we stayed behind and we did not have the paper. I can imagine how my mother felt when they said goodbye to each other. At any rate, eventually the paper came and they packed the list van you know with our belongings with the SS watching every bit of the way what we’re taking, what we’re not. And my mother was very smart and she’d give some away and you know she’d bribe them and all the way. So we got some things together. And they were shipped to the United States to await our eventual arrival.
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: What did you mother take with her?
  </p>
  <p id="139">

  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: What did you take as a child, what did you take with you?
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: What I shipped was all my books and they were children’s. It was ridiculous.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: Your books.
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: Some of them, no value to me. In the end, I gave it to, you know when you give -- I love my books. I didn’t want to give them up. https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 17

  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: Did you know any English at that point?
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: Well yes, because when Hitler came to Vienna, the French governess left. She went, she disappeared almost immediately.

  <p id="182">
   Q: And what were the British children, girls’ reaction to your, or boys and girls reaction to you?
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: They were all right. They sort of ridiculed the English a little bit, but that’s ok. There wasn’t enough time to form great relationships in two months.

  <p id="184">
   Q: Then the next step 1s what? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 20
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: The next step we sailed on March 9" 1939 ona -- from Liverpool to Havana. We went from London by plane actually which was a whole new experience, because my father wanted the children to experience an airplane. And it was a very bad flight but at any rate we did experience the airplane. And then we took the boat and it was a 17 day trip to Havana.

   Q: Again, what were your thoughts about leaving Europe? Here you’re going —
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: At that point one was in motion for the best, getting to the best possible destination. It was -- you will hear . When we got to Cuba. I mean it was an interesting crossing and there were others going to different parts of Latin America, different ports. And similar families. Similar situations and when we landed in Havana, we, men came up to inspect the, the boats and the papers and everything and then transported us into small boats in the harbor. And told us all to go into small boats. And we went into these boats and we thought we were going into Havana. But we weren’t. They shipped us to a small island off the coast. And where they had an orphanage for Cuban children and they separated the men and the women. And they wanted us to buy our way out.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: So were you with your mother at that —
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: I was, well we slept with my mother and my father was in the other, they were bunk beds, double deckers and we weren’t the only ones taken off the boat. There were other people landing there. And so we stayed there and none of the people that were there had money really to buy https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 21 their way out. But the Joint Distribution Committee in Havana did this, helped and we eventually got out. And we went into Havana harbor and you know a number of days later and —

  <p id="194">
   Q: You said there were many refugee families and children. Did the children stick together? Did you —
  </p>

  <p id="204">
   Q: What was, and in handling crises that you were going through? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 22
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: Terrific, terrific, terrific, absolutely terrific. And my father was able, in his too, very business-like, not as broad a horizon but my mother was absolutely an unbelievable woman. And my father, I mean he made all the right decisions so they were both terrific in their way. I don’t — so that’s you know otherwise we wouldn’t be here I don’t think.
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: Did any of your extended family who were far out from Vienna get out when you did?
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: Just one sister of my mother’s eventually many years later. And her husband was actually at the World’s Fair buying machinery when the war broke out in Poland. They were living in Poland and couldn’t get back and so it’s a whole story in itself. So that one came to this country and that sister only just died at age of 104. And her husband the same 103, 104. Yeah. Others, none of them got out.
  </p>
  <p id="208">

  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: Half way up?
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   A: That’s correct with family next to each other. Anyway we got to know some families and three families moved together to a lovely section in the suburbs, living they cost that way so we each family got two bedrooms. So, it was a beautiful house and a huge kitchen which was shared. And with a coal stove. My mother had to light the stove. A big change from what she was brought up to do. But she was terrific. And washed the marble floors and everything. And my father went into town and tried to establish relations with the textile trade. I don’t know how because he didn’t speak Spanish. And the first day that he went to town he was robbed of his good watch, a gold watch which was inherited from his father. But at any rate, he managed. He did establish friendships and relationships and imported textiles for the trade there. I don’t know how he managed, I mean really I don’t know. And they arranged for us, they didn’t like the https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 23 schools, the public schools were impossible. And so they arranged for us to go to private school. And they found a very good private school which without money in my, they called it the English School at the time. And my father used to pay it with fabrics, you know and this woman, a missus, she took us in and we were very fortunate. So we went to school with all upper class Latin children.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: And now you were learning the language?
  </p>
  <p id="213">

  </p>
  <p id="215">

  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Well I knew that for instance we came in March and in June the, another boat came and with refugees called the St. Louis and I saw it in the harbor and I saw yes, yes. We used to go down to the harbor and watch it every day and then one day we went and it left so —

  </p>
  <p id="223">

  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Oh I’m sure my parents took us down to see it. And —
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Were they noticeably affected cause they obviously knew what was happening?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: Well there’s nothing you can do. You know, I’m sure they were affected. I can’t judge that this late in the game.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: How was your younger sister doing? She was how much younger at this point.
  </p>
  <p id="229">

  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: Did you do anything besides go to school? What else did you do in Cuba, in Havana?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: The community was many factions of Judaism so it was funny. There was a large contingent from Frankfurt so they had services in each other’s homes. I mean that wasn’t the children. It’s not, you’re asking me the children or the community?
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: Both, both.
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: Ok, so they were you know different people. Some were religious and some were not. Of the three families where we lived, the ones came from, they had lived in Italy, the one family. They had two teenage boys and they second family had — were Germans and were totally un, were not educated and didn’t have the same vision of wanting the kids to be that well educated either. So there, you know you got used to various types of people. And what else did we do? The school day was long enough and the community was friendly. So but we mixed mostly with our own. Yeah. My father mixed with the trades. And we stayed friends with those Cubans for years later.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Any communication with the people back in Europe?

  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: So life just went on in Cuba.
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: Yes, and we waited for the visa. Some people went sooner, some went later. It depended on where your parents were born and some people had nervous breakdowns in the process. I remember several.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="245">

  <p id="254">
   Q: How did you feel leaving Cuba?
  </p>
  <p id="255">

  <p id="264">
   Q: What, do you remember some of the things you wrote in the diary generally?
  </p>
  <p id="265">
   A: Well the diary is actually strictly political because it was an assignment. But you know they progressed from the Maginot line to this or that. That type of thing.
  </p>
  <p id="266">
   Q: So the description was like —
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   A: Descriptions with some maps from the newspapers.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: Oh I see. It wasn’t your thoughts or your —
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: No, no, no. But my thoughts, I did what I could and wrote something for the children down to my grandchildren.

  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: Terrible. At the time, you mean in Havana. I don’t, I didn’t feel that, I mean it’s not, it’s frightening. That’s all I could say. You know but — https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 28

  <p id="272">
   Q: And how did your parents get the news — from the radio, from newspapers?
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   A: Yes. Yes, radios and newspapers and discussions. There was, there were multiple people living there and meeting, you know getting together and following it very eagerly and hoped for the best.

  <p id="285">
   A: Yes, precisely. Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="286">
   Q: Wonderful. Were you met by your relatives when you arrived?
  </p>
  <p id="287">
   A: By an elderly aunt who actually, she and her husband, they were the parents of the Rothschilds. Mrs. Rothschild, Ida Rothschild and she wanted us to stay with her which she was, actually had a grocery store and a small apartment in Brooklyn and I don’t know if she thought my mother was going to work in the grocery store. We stayed very briefly and my brother in law, the one that had come from Poland and for the World’s Fair to buy some machinery, had by then lived in Lakewood and purchased a farm. And so we had, they thought that the most intelligent thing in the way of moving was my mother and the two children would go to Lakewood and my father would try to establish himself in New York and make connections during the week and come just on the weekend. Anyway we moved, the whole furniture, everything to Lakewood and we stayed there and about five days after we arrived, we had an episode at night where somebody was climbing up the ladder and my brother in law took a shotgun. They used to — and looked out the window and it was my father. He didn’t shoot, who had come to say that the family had to stay together. No matter what. This is no good. So and that’s a good thing because my brother in law was ultra-orthodox so it would have turned out much different. To live with. In general too. I mean this is a very orthodox community in Lakewood. Anyway, my father got us. No, my father and mother went to New York and got an apartment in Washington Heights and we moved to Washington Heights. And I’ve been in New York ever since. And that was you know with the whole furniture and everything.
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   Q: Right so you had all the Viennese furniture.
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   A: It was, not all of it but a good part yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="290">
   Q: Now you’re a teenager and you’re in Washington Heights and your English is good?
  </p>
  <p id="291">

  </p>
  <p id="292">
   Q: Did you live in a community of other refugees?
  </p>
  <p id="293">
   A: Yes. Washington Heights was such a community.
  </p>
  <p id="294">
   Q: Did you think a lot about Vienna at the time? Did you miss it?
  </p>
  <p id="295">
   A: I don’t think so. No that wasn’t an option. I mean it was sort of -- that’s over. That’s was over. Onward.
  </p>
  <p id="296">
   Q: Was your mother very protective of you girls?
  </p>
  <p id="297">

  </p>
  <p id="302">
   Q: What was the reaction of the other girls there at the school? Did they ask you about your background?
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   A: No, I mean — there were others also like it but at that time you know, it wasn’t that relevant I think. I mean it was relevant but I guess I just didn’t make the cut of the ___ side or whatever, just a question of performance. I don’t think so. I mean I don’t —
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   Q: They didn’t ask you what your experience was. That’s what I mean. Did they ask you about your experiences were in Europe, in Vienna? https://collections.ushmm.org January 23, 2014 31
  </p>
  <p id="305">
   A: They weren’t that eager to talk about it as they are now. This generation. We didn’t talk about it that much.

Three littler ones. And they’re from eight to 16 in school in New York and all are very loving and caring human beings as I couldn’t have wished for better.
