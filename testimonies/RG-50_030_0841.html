Then — then they announced again, over the speaker, we need so many volunteers to go inside the building and clean up. What happened was, they had Russian Jews living in there before, and wa — and then when the announcement came that German Jews are coming, they killed all those Russian Jews.

And what they did, the food was so bad, they gave us soup, it was like barley soup. They put — you ever heard — it’s called in German, they put saltpeter in the — in this soup. That means that they want to make men sterile, they didn’t want that they have sex. They didn’t want to have more babies, or anything like that. That was the start with that. And then a piece of bread, like a piece of pie, the shape. And maybe a little margarine or butter, something like that. So, what people did when they got their luggage — if they got their luggage, many people didn’t get their luggage — they would take what — the belongings they had, they would go with something to the Russian, where the Russian concentration camp was.

My mother over here, more women with her. My father over there with other men. And then they said to us, turn around. We had to turn around, and I saw in the distance cattle cars. Cattle cars were waiting for us. I went in the cattle car, I saw a little straw on the — on the — on the floor, and I saw one pail. One pail for so many people. We could — we were just like this, we could not — we could hardly bend to —October 8, 2015 to sit down, you know, [indecipherable]. And then they closed the cattle car, and off we went. And I got the list here of the next concentra — next place where we went.
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   Q: And where was that? What was that, what was the next place?
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   A: Yeah, I have to —
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   Q: Oh, you don’t remember’?
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   Q: Okay, hang on just a second. [break] Okay, so you needed to consult some paper to remember the next place you went to.
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   A: Yes, was —
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   Q: And that — Lublin.
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   A: Lublin, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="400">
   Q: And then you also mentioned off camera, that there was somebody you knew from Hamburg, who was in all of the camps with you. Can you explain?
  </p>
  <p id="401">
   A: That is Edgar. Edgar Cohen was his name. He went to school with me, and somehow we decided we’re going to stick together no matter what happens, and we did. We were lucky th-that we were not separated.
  </p>
  <p id="402">
   Q: So, was he in the same cattle car with you —
  </p>
  <p id="403">
   A: Yes. October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="404">
   Q: — that went to Lublin?
  </p>
  <p id="405">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="406">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="407">
   A: You can contact him, I have his address. He speaks very bad German. He’s very Swedish, he got very —
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   Q: Okay. So — and your parents were in separate cattle cars? No?
  </p>
  <p id="409">
   A: I had no idea what happened to my parents. All I know, I start crying in the — I was crying already in the — 1n the cattle car, worried about — worrying about my parents. I never know until the — but it must be 10 years now. Maybe 10 or 15 years ago I found really out, what happened to my parents.
  </p>
  <p id="410">
   Q: What happened?
  </p>
  <p id="411">
   A: Well, they shot them. They shot them and they throw them — they throw the bodies in the burning barn. And I spent awful many years thinking about it. I said to [indecipherable] is it good not to know it, or is it better to know it?
  </p>
  <p id="412">
   Q: Do you have an answer?
  </p>
  <p id="413">
   A: And neither one is —
  </p>
  <p id="414">
   Q: You don’t — you don’t —
  </p>
  <p id="415">
   A: — salvation. Neither one. No. And my mother was very — you know, everybody’s valuable, any human life. She was very educated, she played the violin. She wasOctober 8, 2015 very musical. Sh-She loved opera like me — like I do, I inherit all that. She liked art, she liked ev — you know. She didn’t know much about Judaism. Only on the high holidays, they went to the temple, [indecipherable] temple in Hamburg. That building is still standing, too.
  </p>
  <p id="416">
   Q: Where did they take — were you brought up in any religious — with any religious instruction?
  </p>
  <p id="417">
   A: Well, I was still lucky to —I still became, on my 13" birthday, you get —
  </p>
  <p id="418">
   Q: Bar Mitzvah, no?
  </p>
  <p id="419">
   A: — Bar Mitzvah. I still had Bar Mitzvah, but not in a — in a synagogue. It was sort of a private home. And I re —I learned to read that, which I can’t even do today any more, the Torah.
  </p>
  <p id="420">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="421">
   A: Yeah. I did that.
  </p>
  <p id="422">
   Q: You did that. So when — so when you were separated from your parents in that field in Belarus, that was the last time you saw them?
  </p>
  <p id="423">
   A: Mm-hm, 19 — 1943, September.
  </p>
  <p id="424">
   Q: And how did you find out conclusively, what had happened to them? When did you — what — what kind of document showed you that?October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="425">
   A: Mr. Norman(ph) in Germany, he’s, like you, an interviewer. And I don’t know, he f — he interviewed me several times. And there’s another organization o-or production, I don’t know what it is, in Germany, they found that out. They found it out, and I’m not 100 percent sure if I have it documented on this — wh-when we are through interviewing me, I will show you.
  </p>
  <p id="426">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="427">
   A: You can take it with you.
  </p>
  <p id="428">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="429">
   A: You can play it and see if you find it.
  </p>
  <p id="430">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="431">
   A: That’s —
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   Q: Okay, so when you —
  </p>
  <p id="433">
   A: — the only documents I think I have.
  </p>
  <p id="434">
   Q: So when you were in Lublin, at that point, you didn’t know. You didn’t know whether they were taken somewhere else —
  </p>
  <p id="435">
   A: No, not — not — no. All these years, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, I didn’t know. It’s horrible.
  </p>
  <p id="436">
   Q: What was Lublin? What — what — what took place in Lublin when you were there?October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   A: I don’t remember. I don’t remember. I don’t remember Lublin, I don’t remember Reichsdorf(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: Excuse me just for a second —
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   A: I went to Plaszow.
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: Okay. [break] Okay, so could you read off — could you tell me about the various camps, and what you remember from each, okay’?
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   A: Well, after Minsk, we were transported to Lublin, Reichsdorf(ph), Plaszow, [indecipherable]. And I don’t remember. I don’t remember what we did there. Then we went to Flossenbirg.
  </p>
  <p id="442">
   Q: In Germany itself?
  </p>
  <p id="443">
   A: In Germany, that’s in Bavaria, and I remember it was — it’s deep down in the valley, the building. I — I remember that we had to get up at four o’clock, 4:30 in the morning, naked. Had to stand outside for two hours to be counted. And they always said, if somebody’s missing, we’re going to shoot so many people.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: Did that happen?
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: No, it did not happen, not that I remember. So that’s when I — in Flossenbirg. Then we went to Kolyma. There we worked for — there we worked for airplane piet — pieces, to make parts for the airplane, I remember that. That was very difficult. Then there was a— I remember there was a — a Frenchman, he worked there, he wasOctober 8, 2015 not an inmate. He gave me, once in a while, piece of bread. He had an apple. And I wrote to him after World War II, until he died. His name was Mr. Parmentier(ph). Okay. Then we went to Obus(ph), I don’t remember anything about Obus(ph). Then we went to Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg.
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: So that’s close —
  </p>
  <p id="447">
   A: That’s in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="449">
   A: Near Berlin. And I have to go back for a moment. In 1939, you probably know, that they had the Crystal Night in Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   Q: I wanted to ask you about that.
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: They had the Crystal Night, and they picked up my father, and all the Jews in Hamburg, and he was sent to — he was sent to —
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   Q: Sachsenhausen’?
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   A: Sachsenhausen. I think he was there for two months. And when he came home, he said to my mother, he had to sign a piece of paper not to talk what he saw, and he what — what — he never talked about it. And then we went to Braunschweig, I don’t remember much there either.
  </p>
  <p id="454">
   Q: What about Sachsenhausen? Do you have any memories of Sachsenhausen?
  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: Yeah, that’s — that was Oranienburg, Sachsenhausen.October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: Yeah. Do you have memories of being there, and —
  </p>
  <p id="457">
   A: Well, yes. I don’t know if I should — we had to stay again outside in the morning, naked. And one guy was counting us. He was gay. And he looked at me, he told me to come forward, towards him. I did, and he asked me if I want to work wi — or get a — work with him, get a job, it’s called kapo. You heard of kapos?
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   Q: Tell me who they were.
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: Yes. So I liked the idea, and I didn’t like the idea because I felt I was so young, and I should tell other people who are much older than I am, to go and do this, and do that, and — and [indecipherable] — I thought it was not my place to do. But I did it. So that’s that. And then we come to Neuengamme. | can’t remember which, to be honest with you, it was one of the ca — one of the camps’ barracks. There was some gay people again. They said the Nazis are going to come any moment. They’re going to — they’re going to go through the barracks. And they put us in the attic, Edgar and me, they put us in the attic, and I was there for several hours. So, if they would have come, they probably would have picked us and kill us. So they sa — that’s why I’m always very thankful to them. They were very good to me that way.
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   Q: So, there were other prisoners who told you about that, and they — and that meant that they hid you in the attic? Is that —October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: They hid me in the attic, yes, but I can’t remember which one it was. And now we come almost to the end. They took us on the train, and then they put us in Flensburg, which is very north of Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: Near Denmark, I believe.
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: Yes. And they put us on a— on a ship, on a freighter — freighter type ship. Not — we didn’t know what they had in mind. They actually had in mind to sink the ship. And I have a book, a German book where another man was on the ship, and he knows the name of the ship — I don’t know the name of the ship — but they didn’t have time to do that because the American came already, so they were fleeing the Nazis. And we saw in the distance, we saw tiny, little boats coming from Sweden. The Red Cross came and took us down.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Out of the boat, out of the ship.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Out of the boat, and saved us. I was brought to Sweden. I was already — and the war ended se-seven of May, I think, ’45.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: Yeah, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: I was already free on the seven of May. I was already in Sweden.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: So — you were in Sweden, so when they put you on that ship, was that early May, or was that late April? October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: That was — that must have been early May. Early May, and I think some people — yeah, there were some Germans still on it. They asked me, and I said I’m Polish. I —I couldn’t dare — I wouldn’t dare to say I was Jewish. My friend didn’t look Jewish either. He also said, I’m Polish. Well, they know we didn’t have any papers, so they had to believe us.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: Mm-hm. And —
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: [indecipherable] what I’m telling you.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   A: I mean that’s — there’s much more to it than this, but —
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   Q: Would you like to tell me a little bit more?
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: I just — I just really don’t know. I don’t want to make mistake. We were put in quarantine in Sweden —
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   A: — for several months. And then, during the day, we could go in the courtyard. There were hundreds of people every day, from the streets, people asking questions. Refugees who left Germany or other parts of Europe. Have you seen my — you were in Minsk, have you seen my brother, have you seen my sister, and so on, you know. So one — some woman said to me, have you seen my brother? I said, yes, I’ve seen him. I hate to tell you, but he was — he was killed. His name was October 8, 2015 Horowitz(ph), Hugo Horowitz(ph). So she said, would you visit me after you come out of this quarantine? I said yeah, I will do that. But in the meantime, they called them lottas(ph), those Swedish — they work for the Red Cross, I guess, the type — that type. She insisted that I go to — go to her house. She had five sons. She said one — she said one more or less doesn’t make any difference. I was with them for two — for several months. They were very good to me. Very, very good. Lovely people.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: So this was in Sweden?
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: In Sweden, in Helsingborg. This took place in Helsingborg. In the meantime, I visit this Jewish lady for — from Hamburg. I visit her, and we became friends, and I went to America, we kept in touch. We became very, very close. They wanted adopt — they wanted to adopt me, but I didn’t want to change my name. Their name were Liebentowski(ph). Liebentowski(ph) had a relative. You probably can find that in the Jewish museum. [indecipherable] music. You will find that in some books, Jewish books, his name, Liebentowski(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: Liebentowski(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: That was his cousin, I guess.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: And they were from Hamburg, and they had wanted to kind of take you in and adopt you. Were they also going to the United States? October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: I visit them — I promised them that I would never leave this country. I wasn’t happy in this country.
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: In the United States?
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: No. I found everything very strange. I always heard money, money, money. I always heard money. I thought it was so strange to me, the word money. But we c — we — I visit them all the time. I moved away from San Diego to San Francisco, and I visit them every year, two or three times. They came to me. In 1953, I met a gentleman from Slovenia. He also was in concentration camp, several camps, many camps, and —
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: Was he Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: No, no, he was Catholic, he was Catholic. And we lived together 46 years.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: Forty-six years. It was a per — most perfect set up I ever had in my life.
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: What was his name?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: Anton Rsl.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: Anton Rsl.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: I have his picture here somewhere.
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Maybe you can show that to us later. Yeah, the — his picture. So he had —
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: Yeah, it’s — October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: Had he been in camps because — had he been arrested —
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: We had so much — we had so much in common. We had the same ambitions, we wanted to live nice, peaceful, and we built even a house in San Francisco, it’s still standing. Nice home.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: Can we cut, just for a second? [break] Gary, you mentioned — you mentioned some of the episodes that you went through, and I want to ask you now about some much more personal things, and I — I apologize in advance for the prying that this involves. But I think — the reason why I am doing so, is so that people in the future would have a much clearer sense of exactly what kind of danger, what kind of suffering people went through when they had no power, when they were completely helpless. So, if we could start with this incident when you were in Sachsenhausen, and someone pulled you aside. What did that entail? This man pulled you aside, he was a kapo, is that correct?
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   A: Well, it — when he looked at me, and I looked at him, I knew exactly — I was — my instinct told me, I knew exactly what it meant, right then and there, I knew that.
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: And what did it mean? What did it mean? October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: Well, it meant that he wanted to, if I like it or not, I have to sleep with him. I have to have —
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: I understand.
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: And I did this for several weeks.
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: Was this —
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: Several weeks, as long as I was in that camp.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: Was this the first time something like that —
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: That was the first time in Flossenbirg, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: In Sachsenhausen’?
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: Yeah, Sachsenhausen, not — not before.
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: Not before.
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: No, not before, no.
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: So in other words, it’s your first sexual experience.
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: And it happens in this way?
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: Yes. I had another I’d a — it was not a sexual experience, when we were in ru — in Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: Okay.October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: We went out to some — someplace in the country. Was some big building, I don’t know, was — was to work some — something there, and I — I walked away a little bit from — from the building, I was all by myself, standing by a tree. And out of the blue skies came a soldier, German soldier. And he looked me deep in the eyes, and he said — he said to me, you want to get away from all this? You want to go ma — go with me? And I hesitated of course, I said yes, no, yes, no. Maybe it’s a good thing I didn’t do that, because I probably would be — we probably both would be caught, and would be shot. So that was another experience and that — gay experience.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   Q: Did you know yourself, inside, did you know what your — what your proclivity was? Did you know you were gay at that age?
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   A: I was just young.
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   Q: That’s why —
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: I just didn’t — I just didn’t know. I didn’t know. I thought I’ll grow — I thought I would outgrow it, you know? I didn’t know. I didn’t know. And I — sex was not on my mind —
  </p>
  <p id="524">
   Q: Survival —
  </p>
  <p id="525">
   A: —1n all th — in all these — you know.
  </p>
  <p id="526">
   Q: I can imagine that it wouldn’t be.
  </p>
  <p id="527">
   A: No, sex was not on my mind. October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   Q: Did these — did you see — did you see these types of things with — with people around you?
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   A: Well, it — 1t — it happened to my — to my Edgar, it happened to him, too.
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   Q: Did it?
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: This man’s name was Hoffman(ph), or — I don’t know, I don’t remember. So Edgar — but Edgar was not mad at all for this. And so one day he didn’t want to do it, so this Hoffman(ph) took all his clothes away, stripped him completely of his clothes, he had no clothes, he could not get out of — out of the barrack. He could not, and he cried. And he cried and he cried and he cried. So — and he’s a little smaller and — than me, and —
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: Was this in Sachsenhausen?
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: — it was terrible. No, I cannot tell you what cam — camp it was, but I remember the event, yeah, because he told me, and I saw the man. It was another prisoner.
  </p>
  <p id="534">
   Q: It was another prisoner?
  </p>
  <p id="535">
   A: It was another prisoner, probably a gay prisoner.
  </p>
  <p id="536">
   Q: It is your —
  </p>
  <p id="537">
   A: And Edgar’s very straight, he’s got a nice family, and he’s a grandfather, and he was never that way.
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   Q: Well, regardless, it is exploiting the powerless. October 8, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: Yes, that’s what they did.
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: It is —
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: That’s what they did with women, too, of course, you know. You know that.
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: With women.
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   Q: And how — how were you able to deal with this? I mean, I — I can’t imagine what Is —
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   A: I just — I just did from day to day, that’s what you do. You cannot think of tomorrow, or day after tomorrow. You’re just so — I can’t believe it, to be honest with you, I think about it night and day. I can’t believe it today, that this happened, that this happened, this whole thing. That this happened to me. That I’m still here. I’m still here. Because it’s very stressful.
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   A: Very stressful.
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   Q: All I could imagine is that it’s one nightmare after another.

  </p>
  <p id="553">
   A: Yeah, it’s always about power, and not having the power, and being — can’t do what you want to do, somebody’s following you. It’s always in that direction, yes.

  </p>
  <p id="559">
   A: Yes. It was a pi — we had wonderful friends, wonderful friends. [indecipherable] didn’t make any difference. They were perfect people at my — but they all have passed on.
  </p>
  <p id="560">
   Q: And your friend also, your partner, his name again, can you tell me?
  </p>
  <p id="561">
   A: Anton Rsl.

  <p id="562">
   Q: Anton Rsl.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   A: R-s-l.
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   Q: R-s-], uh-huh, Anton Rsl.
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   A: Yeah. We went to —1999, we — we — we went to Nice. We liked Nice. We went there three or four times. He got very excited one day in a store the last time. Somebody pushed themself in front of us. He got red in the face, I'll never forget it. October 8, 2015 Screamed at her. He said, you’re like the ger — like the Germans, the Germans do that. So next day was a special holiday in Nice. I can’t — you probab — I don’t know what holiday it was. It was a Sunday, too. We had breakfast, then we went for a walk. And all of a sudden, he said, I can’t walk any more. So I leaned him against the wall, and then I saw a hotel. I managed to get him to the hotel, drank water, then we took a taxi back to the ho-hotel where we stayed, and called a doctor. And doctor — and Anton was in pajama, laid on top of the bed. Couldn’t find peace, couldn’t — couldn’t stay put in one position. And the doctor came, opened the hotel do-door to the room, the door. And I had a gold — gold watch on, hundred dollar watch. He said, oh, you have a beautiful watch on. I thought, uh-oh, that’s the wrong doctor. I’m sure that be the wrong doctor. So he examined him. He said, I give him a shot. He be okay in two hours. It was the worst thing he could have done. In two hours he got up, he said — I said, I’m going to call your friend in Yugoslavia, you talk to him. And I dialed the number, and he just — he just slumped over. And I — I caught him real quick, and I was holding him, I — he probably doesn’t know any more. He probably was already gone.
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   Q: And that’s how you lost him?
  </p>
  <p id="567">
   A: So then I— I wrote a nasty note to the doctor, I said, I’m gonna sue you. Something is — something is wrong here. Then I went to here, and somebody, a October 8, 2015 nurse, and I showed her what the doctor did. She said, that was the wrong thing to do. He could have lived. He had a heart attack. He needed to be rushed to the hospital.
  </p>
  <p id="568">
   Q: Oh dear.
  </p>
  <p id="569">
   A: So that’s how he died.
  </p>
  <p id="570">
   Q: What a bitter end.
  </p>
  <p id="571">
   A: And then they were so cruel. When he was laying in the bed, there were so many people around him, I don’t know what, and I was way back. He had a big cross here, a golden cross. They ripped that off and stole it. They stole that. I mean, they’re awful. And then I couldn’t get the ashes, I had to wait seven months — six months I had to wait for the ash-ashes. They said they were — that their crematorium or the funeral parlor was bankrupt, or something. I got the ashes sitting here. I don’t believe it’s his ashes. I don’t believe it. It’s just a tiny little thing, like that.
  </p>
  <p id="572">
   Q: Anton, had he been arrested? Why was he 1n concentration camps?
  </p>
  <p id="573">
   A: Why was he in concentration camps, that’s a good question. It has something to do with Tito. Tito was after the students, I believe. I think the students were revolting, many years ago. Do you know anything about it?
  </p>
  <p id="574">
   Q: So he was not ar — he was not arrested by the Nazis, he was arrested by the communists?October 8, 2015

   A: He was Yugoslavian at that time.
  </p>
  <p id="584">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="585">
   A: But then later — but his mother was in German concentration camp. They came to the — they came — the Germans came to their village, those — with orange — everybody out, everybody out, everybody out, and they took over. She had to leave the cows, everything — everything they all had. And she was put in a concentration camp, but she survived. And he met her after the war. She came to Germany, I remember that very well. This was sit in the park, and — and she died after that.
