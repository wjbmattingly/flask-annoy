   Q: Different?
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: Different. And we had new also, but the new ones is — was strictly one price, you know. But it — this was different. You had to look over the whole coat and then see the pr — to find out the price.

  <p id="462">
   Q: What did y — did you see your father in action as a businessperson?
  </p>

  <p id="464">
   Q: What did you learn from him? Wha — how — what was his manner’?

  <p id="465">
   A: He tried the best for the customer, because this way he always came back.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: Even if he didn’t buy it, but they came to see it. And this was very important. He knew as honest as — as it is. So always he had to buy something, or the two brothers th — recommended one another to go into the store.

  <p id="468">
   Q: Did he also do custom made suits, or custom made, in addition to ready-to-wear?

   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: Yeah.

  <p id="476">
   Q: Oh, I just had a thought. Let’s go to Pilsudski.

  <p id="477">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: He died in 1935.
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: In ’35, yes. I remember this.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: Do you? Tell me a — tell me about that.
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: It was a very b — terrible feeling. We knew Pilsudski was a right man, and the Jews were not — that he was not anti-Semite. And this was a terrible thing for us. And when Smigly-Rydz(ph) came in, was already a different story, it was — somehow that’s how we f — we felt.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: Did — did life change, that affected you in some way, your family?
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: I am gonna tell you something. The principal of the school was Polish, a Polish man, because we went to Polish school. He was a anti-Semite that you never saw something like it. I remember he came in in the morning, and everybody had to say May 22, 2016 good morning, of course, we were all stand up, I stood up, and in the front of me was sitting a boy, a Jewish boy, and he had the payos. He walks over to him, he takes by his ears, and starts shaking him. He says [speaks Polish].
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: What does that —
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: Without no reason at all.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: What does that mean?
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: You Jew, they smell from onions, and this and that.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: The poor boy.
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: Imagine the feeling what we had about this.
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: And he’s the principal of your school.
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: He’s the principal of the school. Imagine this.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: And this is after Pilsudski’s death. Or he was like that anyway’?
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: It — it was — it was before, but this was already after he died, because at that time —I don’t remember it because so far — it was too far already. Because it was a difference in four years, whatever it was. You go seven years to school, so I didn’t — but we all — the — the Christians always, when it was, let’s say palze(ph), I mean.
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: It was a — recess.
  </p>
  <p id="495">

  <p id="502">
   Q: So it was difficult to get external documents?
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: Yes, sure, of course. To get permission that would go out from Poland. And then you had to have permission who do — who’s going to take you in. There was nowhere to go.

   Q: So, it wasn’t a financial issue, of not having enough money to leave, it was more than that? 37May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: I guess it was more than this, but eventually — it didn’t help everything. It could maybe help, not too much. But there was nobody to give us permission.

They didn’t look for us, nobody. Only at night they came. And I myself saw — I —I-—I had a bottle of wine. It was on the black market, it was across the street here. The Russian soldier come over, he wanted to buy the bottle. So I said, well, you can buy it. Give me ch-chevernces(ph), three chevernces(ph). Was chevernce(ph), was traded lira, the rubles, whatever it was. He took out, they gave it to me.

  </p>
  <p id="899">
   A: But they saw a bottle that — they only looked for bottles and drink and beer, with everything it is.
  </p>
  <p id="900">
   Q: Were people afraid, in general? Did you get the sense that people were afraid?
  </p>
  <p id="901">
   A: They was afraid because it started up already, but you couldn’t get what you wanted. Bread was hard to get, you have to stay in line. Sometimes you stayed in line and you didn’t get nothing. Was nothing left. And the stores sold out everything. It was har — very hard to get some food. And was — is not easy. Anyway, my father decided that we gonna go to us — to them and then be here, be [indecipherable] because they were looking for us, whatever it is.
  </p>
  <p id="902">
   Q: Your — did you know that they were looking for you?
  </p>
  <p id="903">

  <p id="904">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="905">
   A: — and live in one place. Maybe they’ll come tonight, they’ll come for us. They never had to wait for this — that woman which took care of the building. So, otha — she was happy that we came, now she can tell the officers, the Russian officers that they’re here, and you can take them away. And that’s what happened. Took a s — officer from the street.

  </p>
  <p id="909">
   A: Yeah, and said here, they were looking for them. Here they are. So it was not far where the — the jail was. Was a jail which the — and so we were together. And my father had to prepare himself for a lot of things. He had a bottle of vodka, not because he wanted to drink, because if some kind of infection comes over, he said to him, we need this for these things. So he wanted just a bottle of vodka to the guy, the officer. My father said no. Not giving you nothing. Anyway, they took us to this place, and the officer went to a bigger officer and told him that he has a bottle of vodka, he doesn’t want to give it over. So, he came, he looked at us, this father with three sons, and maybe he was Jewish, the officer. He said, leave him alone. My father saw this, he still needed some — something to buy from drugstore, whatever May 22, 2016 that it is. So he asks the officer, can I go out? I'll leave mine sons here, to buy what I need still. You can go. They let him out. He knew he is gonna come back. And he came back, and around 12 o’clock at night, one o’clock in the morning, we’re put on trucks, open trucks. And there were two soldiers, one one side, and the other side. And they showed us, they put in bullets. In case somebody jumps or something, we’re gonna kill you. And put us in trains.

   Q: Okay. Can we stop for a second? [break] So let’s roll again. I needed to understand a little bit of what this meant, and — and if I understand what you’re telling me, is that this Russian, who was so tall, and strong, and able to cut down the tree —
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   Q: — said that it would be — that you’ ll live — that everybody would live, but they would lose all their desires.
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   A: Right, exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   Q: Okay. And he said it in a crude way.
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   A: In very crude way, yes. 79May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1058">
   Q: Okay. And that was the only news that you had of what was awaiting you?
  </p>
  <p id="1059">
   A: Well, we saw something else there. That was a couple of horses that went a little deep in the woods. They were killed by wolves. So a lot of people went there to take the meat there, from it. It was just like this, just happened. There were a couple horses, and they just went to de — a little deep in the woods, they got killed.
  </p>
  <p id="1060">
   Q: By this point were you hungry?
  </p>
  <p id="1061">
   A: Oh yeah, we were hungry, and that — there was a terrible thing there. They gave us food which we couldn’t eat. They used to give us fish soup. So we only saw bones with eyes, like this fish — from big fish. And the smell of this was so strong, that I couldn’t eat it. My family couldn’t eat it. Went by one day — the piece of bread was good, one day, two days, three day — took a week, we get used to it, and was good later on. You have no choice. The body got used to it.
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   Q: So when you arrived, you were put in these barracks. What did they look like?
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   A: The barracks look new. There was enough wood to — to be warm, which sometimes is not so good, because when it’s very cold outside, it’s even colder, because when you warm, you go out in this when you’re warm — if you’re a little cooler, it’s not so cold.
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   Q: You have much more to adjust to when you’re warm.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   A: Yeah, exactly. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   Q: Was it a very cold place?
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   A: Very cold, very cold. We ha — we used to go to work to cut down the trees, you know? And we had to look at each other when we went home, if — see the faces, if the nose is white, or the cheek is white, so you had to take snow and rub it in, the circulation will come back. If not, it will fall off.
  </p>
  <p id="1068">
   Q: Oh my, mm-hm. Was — were there guards? Was this surrou — did you have —
  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   A: There — there was no need for guards. Where you gonna go? You’re surrounded only in the woods. You don’t know nothing there.
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   Q: Was there anybody who — in authority, in control?
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   Q: And who was that?
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   A: His name was Volgapolof(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   Q: Volgapolof(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   A: Something like this, Dulgapolof(ph), yeah. Nice man. He had a wife, and a kid there. Dolgapolof(ph), Dolgapolof(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   Q: Dolgapolof(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   A: Yes. And he was very shrewd man, very —
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   Q: A what — a shrewd man. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   A: — shrewd, yeah, yeah. But he was also sent there because of this, that somehow, you know, they knew where — they always took people for nothing, they put them somewhere, for no reason at all, sometimes good places, sometimes the good pla — some the worst places. I remember one day I couldn’t go to work. Was so cold, I couldn’t work. I said to myself, this time I’m not going to go to work. So I went out, I had to go to the toilet, whatever, it was outside. And he saw me, Dolgapolof(ph) and he told me to come over, so I went over to him. He says to me, why don’t you work? I said, I wa— I’m very cold, and I’m 15 years old, and the law says about 15 years old, I don’t have to work. What’s your name? So I told him the name, and took a red pencil, and make a mark there. But he didn’t do nothing. And when the spring came, there was no night.
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   Q: So you’re already in this place for half a year.
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   Q: From October °40 to spring 1941.
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   A: And at that time, it was no night. It was daytime.
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   Q: So you were that far north?
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   A: Yes. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   Q: Okay. Can you give me a sense geographically —
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   A: Where it was?
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   Q: — where this pla — yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   A: I can’t. It was not on the map even, this.
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
   A: They just cut out, middle of the woods somewhere, and they said, this is it.
  </p>
  <p id="1094">
   Q: And your father and your brothers would go to work every day?
  </p>
  <p id="1095">
   A: Yeah. Then I went back to work.
  </p>
  <p id="1096">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1097">
   A: Went back. But that — that time — on that day, I didn’t — I couldn’t — you know, I couldn’t go, it was so shivering. Was 40 below zero, imagine.
  </p>
  <p id="1098">
   Q: What kind of clothes did you have?
  </p>
  <p id="1099">
   A: That’s a good at — not too good. Not too good. But we had clothes, yeah, we had things. But was — when you came to the barrack, was very good, was warm, because we had a lot of wood, all night long, 24 hours was burning.
  </p>
  <p id="1100">
   Q: Well, did they give you clothes, or is this whatever you —
  </p>
  <p id="1101">
   A: No, they didn’t give us no clothes.
  </p>
  <p id="1102">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1103">
   A: No. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1104">
   Q: Did they give you anything, except those fish soup?
  </p>
  <p id="1105">
   A: The fish soup. Sometimes maybe an extra piece of bread or something, I don’t [indecipherable] or a little butter maybe. I don’t know, I don’t remember. But the fish soup was terrible. You could see big bones, swimming with big eyes, we — was frozen for — from a barrel they took, and just took it. And that’s it.
  </p>
  <p id="1106">
   Q: And that’s the soup.
  </p>
  <p id="1107">
   A: That’s soup.
  </p>
  <p id="1108">
   Q: Were people — did anybody die from hunger?
  </p>
  <p id="1109">
   A: This is a good question. Nobody died, only one old man died. But if you would stay there a little longer, it started up already, because we sold everything from us, which we have. There was always a black market somehow. And they sold, you know, we had pants, nice pants, so we made different pants and this and that. My father knew how to [indecipherable] with this. But we didn’t have nothing to sell any more. And not only we, but everybody. If would stay another year, there would be a lot of casualties, a lot.
  </p>
  <p id="1110">
   Q: So in other words, if I understand this right, you were dumped in the middle of the woods, and you’re put to work.
  </p>
  <p id="1111">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1112">
   Q: You live in a barracks. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1113">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1114">
   Q: And the only other people around there are other prisoners just like yourself?
  </p>
  <p id="1115">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1116">
   Q: Who did you sell the goods to?
  </p>
  <p id="1117">
   A: There was people which came near us, which they lived there a long time. Also people [indecipherable] which they put down there. And they lived there, they had private houses already, it was different. They had a piece of land which is from here to there, that in summer, they put up a couple potatoes, a bit of fruit, or what, something.
  </p>
  <p id="1118">
   Q: They were local people?
  </p>
  <p id="1119">
   A: Local people, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1120">
   Q: So they’re not prisoners?
  </p>
  <p id="1121">
   A: They were prisoners before.
  </p>
  <p id="1122">
   Q: But they’re released.
  </p>
  <p id="1123">
   A: They — they were — they part also — they couldn’t go nowhere, there was no transportation.
  </p>
  <p id="1124">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1125">
   A: They didn’t have horses, or whatever, just a — so they walked over, whatever there was, and they bought and they sold it, you know. May 22, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="1126">
   Q: And what would you get for the things that you sold?
  </p>
  <p id="1127">
   A: A potato.
  </p>
  <p id="1128">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1129">
   A: Mostly a potato, that’s it. Piece of bread was hard to get.
  </p>
  <p id="1130">
   Q: Okay. When you said there’s no transportation, you say that the train took you to — for seven weeks —
  </p>
  <p id="1131">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1132">
   Q: — did it take you straight into this woods, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1133">
   A: No, no, no, no, we stopped, went, and then there were horses with carriages, and they put us up to pu — not us to — just to valise to — whatever we had, to put in on the — and this was it. And we walked for three, four hours like this, maybe more, five hours, til we reach our destination.
  </p>
  <p id="1134">
   Q: Okay. So there is a tra — railroad that is about four hours walk from where the camp is, from where this barracks is.
  </p>
  <p id="1135">
   A: No, this — this was not a railroad there yet.
  </p>
  <p id="1136">
   Q: Okay.

  </p>
  <p id="1139">
   A: And had small houses where the — I don’t know exactly what was there. And they had a little bit of a garden —
  </p>
  <p id="1140">
   Q: I understand.
  </p>
  <p id="1141">
   A: — 1n the spring that they — they — and they sold this, they won’t — because they couldn’t get a suit, or they couldn’t get nothing so — from us, they took us.
  </p>
  <p id="1142">
   Q: Okay. And then you ran out, you ran out of — of things to sell.
  </p>
  <p id="1143">
   A: That’s what I mean.
  </p>
  <p id="1144">
   Q: And — and in the time you’re there, in the half year that we’re talking about, in the spring, one woman has died —

  <p id="1166">
   Q: What did you do after — it was only cutting trees, or was it doing something with the logs?
  </p>
  <p id="1167">
   A: They were waiting til the snow was deep, then came tractors, and they took away the logs.
  </p>
  <p id="1168">
   Q: All the logs?
  </p>
  <p id="1169">

   Q: Oh, so your production was noted. How much pro — how productive you —
  </p>
  <p id="1179">
   A: How much, yes. But it was worthless, because he was a drunk, and he — he gave him anything to drink, everyth — everythi — perfume, even, he — it went. When — when we saw — I saw that once, and I — when he marked the — when they cut off the marks, I came and marked it again.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="1189">
   A: How long will it be? And then there was a man, about 15 kilometers deep — deeper, one man. And he used to come to us about bread which belongs to him, cause they couldn’t deliver to him, so every time they send him somewhere else. He was living alone [indecipherable] barracks, and he says, the wolves were all around him. The men looked wild, completely. He had a beard, and had two guns. His eyes were like — you never saw something like it. They never saw a person. That’s how they did.

  </p>
  <p id="1205">
   A: I learned a little bit. Course Polish and Russian were — my brother, my older brother, he was very intelligent, looks like it, but course when we get the paper — I knew sometimes we got the newspaper somewhere by chance.

They found out that I can do these things. I said, I May 22, 2016 am not going to nobody, because they gave me the chance, and I’m not going for no money in the world. I can go for hour, for two, but forget about — they thought they going take me in, forget about it. And one day my boss, he was not a citizen, a Italian citizen. So somebody calls him, says to him, Yasha(ph), you can [indecipherable] very well. I knew the people also. He had only permission to work, my boss, cause over there citizens don’t go — they don’t give out citizens just like this. Sojourno(ph), they give him, sojourno(ph) or something. Permission to work, whatever it is, in business, but oh no, I can make you a citizen if you give me Arie for three weeks.

  <p id="1900">

  <p id="1901">
   A: It was hard in America to make a living, to make yourself a name, and to have money to [indecipherable] which I [indecipherable] I overpaid, but I was so good in it, I did 10 percent which I overpaid, I made [indecipherable] and I worked 155May 22, 2016 myself in assortments.

  <p id="1902">
   Q: I want to ask something about, now that we’ve kind of come to — close to the end.
  </p>
  <p id="1903">

  </p>
  <p id="1904">
   Q: Did you, when you were a boy, you went to synagogue, you were — came from a religious family.
  </p>
  <p id="1905">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1906">
   Q: Did you ever lose your faith?
  </p>
  <p id="1907">
   A: Yes. I knew you gonna ask me this. It’s normal. It’s a good question. I lost it.
  </p>
  <p id="1908">
   Q: Where?
  </p>
  <p id="1909">
   A: Here in the United States. Over there it didn’t go anyway, these all places, it came to the United States also. I never, let’s say when I went to work on Saturdays, and I saw people going to — to synagogue, and I [indecipherable] that I used to smoke. Never smoked [indecipherable] I had to go — take a bus. I went to the bus — I never was somebody which pushed it away, but the same time I didn’t believe in nothing because there’s nothing to believe. Cause if you go through it, God can make a mistake once — even not once, because God is everywhere. When he saw this whole thing going for six years, or more, where was he? But I had things which May 22, 2016 — which a normal person doesn’t do. I could be in business, and I know I’m doing the wrong thing. I did it anyway. What I mean is, I came once, I don’t know if I shall tell this story or not. A man, he came from Jizzakh, in the section over there, he was born there, a Jew. Big family, Russian. And I spoke to him once in my life. I don’t know, he — his name til today. And he ask me to lend him 5,000 dollars. I don’t know your name, you — why are you coming to me to ask me? Go to the bank. He wants to give me 500 dollars in t — for three weeks, four weeks. Why? I’m not there in this kind of business, I said to him. There were two people, I had another man with me [indecipherable] deal. He knew him, he run away right away right away, and holds my hand to — and holds me like this, and I sit down the front, on 34" Street, you know, I sit there. And the father is about 20 feet from — his father. A Russian Jew, with the moustache and with the — he doesn’t let me go. And I say to myself, what does he want from me? I don’t know him. The man runs away, which dealt with him. What is this all about? But he doesn’t let go. I give you 700 dollars for it, for three weeks, for a month. I said, I’m not in this business. Back and forth, back and forth. The father stays on the side. I tell him, listen, if you don’t tell me my na — what you need it for, you’re not getting a penny, I said. If you tell me what you need it for — because I thought maybe somebody kidnapped somebody, whatever it was. Because he was so insistent, eyes like this. Young, 32 years old. 157May 22, 2016 Pll tell you, he says. What do you need this money, I said. It’s not that I don’t need —I need the money, he says. I haven’t got the money now, people owe me the money, and I need now money because there’s going to be an auction of old machinery, what he uses. He was a dresser. Fur has to be dressed. If I can buy, doesn’t mean nothing to me, the 5,000 dollars, th-th-the 500 dollars or the 700 dollars. So since he came up with something like this, I could understand, because is auction, 9:30, or whatever it was, the time, and they don’t take checks.
  </p>
  <p id="1910">
   Q: It’s cash.
  </p>
  <p id="1911">
   A: Cash, yeah. So I say to him, okay, you gonna get it. His face lighten up. And I said twa — to him, with one condition. Condition? Steps up, gets wild. I said, take it easy. One condition. What’s the condition, he says. I don’t want no interest from you. I don’t want no money from you. I’ll give you the loan, but no interest, if you want to. You agree? He says, course I agree. Not finished with him. Just want to bring you out for [indecipherable] By 12 o’clock, he is in my store. What’s the matter Ronnie(ph)? I knew it was — his first name, the other. I didn’t buy. Why? This was not for me. I told you he’s gonna give me the money. Gives me two and a half thousand, and he holds back. Two and a half thousand, Ill give you in 30 days. Bartered me a little bit, but I said to myself, if he wanted to take away, he didn’t May 22, 2016 have to come with nothing. So I'll wait another 30 days, fine. Thirty days, he paid me, gave me back the 5,000 dollars. Nice, right?
  </p>
  <p id="1912">
   Q: It seems that way.
  </p>
  <p id="1913">
   A: Yeah. Was not the finished. I got a call, American company, a big company, they were in Newark. They used for — for — material, make hats, beaver hats, whatever it is. I want to show you something, could you come over? Because I used to deal with them also, I used to sell them beavers pieces [indecipherable]. I said, okay, come. He is taking — picks me up at the station, shows me a sample, a beaver skin. Damaged [indecipherable] beaver skin, and this bleached, the hair, not the leather.
  </p>
  <p id="1914">

   A: This is — have to be something special. He says, I’m using only the hair, he said. They go — and I have maybe 20 - 30,000 pounds. I needed — I said ta — I said to him, when he shows me, I said to him, why do you want me to do that? You have a man, you show me a sample, it’s good. So why do you want me? You’re right, he says, May 22, 2016 you’re right what you’re telling me, but he makes me only 200 pounds a week, and I need thousand pounds a week. Find me somebody, he says.
  </p>
  <p id="1920">
   Q: To bleach the hair.
  </p>
  <p id="1921">
   A: Yeah. I go to so many people, you have no idea. One burns, one this and one that.
  </p>
  <p id="1922">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1923">
   A: Unbelievable, unbelievable. I go to a man which he knows me, which I used to give him skins to dress, whatever. He says to me, Arie, you know what you want? Did you ever see a woman half pregnant? That’s what you want. It’s not dressed, it’s not [indecipherable] what do you want? Okay, take it easy, I said. I was disappointed, it was going on this for five weeks, six weeks. My wife said already, leave it alone, what are you doing to yourself? I have a feeling something, I said, I have to — as I go out this door, the Russian goes by, I catch him by his hand, take him in this door. Sure [indecipherable] and I tell him what I need. He never did it, he said. Give me, I'll make you samples. I gave him samples. One comes in good, so I give him six to make. One 1s not good, but it looks, maybe. I give him again more samples. One, same thing. Call up the factory, I said, look, that’s in this, this, and I showed him there. Give him 20 pounds to make.
