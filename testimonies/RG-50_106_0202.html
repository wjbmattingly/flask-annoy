  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: Oh really.
  </p>
  <p id="93">

It was allowed only to go to a chemical school or to a, to a what we called actually not a gymnasium, yes. And I don’t have the right expression for it now. It’s —

  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: He did not. Actually he did not and I actually was — I didn’t talk to him so open how I should and how he could. And we were aware — I thought that actually he is holding back something to me because I was at the age of 16 at that time and I think he was not of the opinion that I can understand the whole thing and that I, he wanted probably to hold me out of it.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: Yes. So did you have any contact with him after he left?
  </p>
  <p id="133">

We didn’t know that we were going to Berlin to take care about the dead people and about the ruins there. And we were actually astonished when we landed at Berlin, the capital of Germany and had to be there almost one half a year and do the job. So this handles about the book and then it handles about actually the time when the Germans came to occupy the Czech area. And then it handles about even about the time that the Czech Republic changed to the communist republic. In both of these times were actually for us a very hard time to survive this. https://collections.ushmm.org December 21, 2012 So actually it had, it had the book handles about the surviving both of these times, the German time and then the communist.

And actually it would happen that one will stay in Czech Republic, the other one in Germany and the third one the United States so I didn’t know what to do. Yes, it was a little bit complicated.

   Q: Such as what?
  </p>
  <p id="483">

There were other sort of people and people got, actually tried to get their lives again and I think they hadn’t time to talk about this. And when I saw it after all this time, this museum I was very impressed by the way, how it handles things. And even there is another part of the museum which handles just children.

There are very few people and they do not have any influence at the politics and I don’t think that, and the people since that time is now 50 or 55 years after the war. They just change in thinking and they are not any more racist I think.
