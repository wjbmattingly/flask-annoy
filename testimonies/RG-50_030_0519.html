So when he finds I’m over here, so he can start talk to me, what do you want to do in America? I says, I will do anything, I just want a job. So he took me out one day, he drove around with me. He said, I’m building here and I’m building -- it was a big building. And then we pass by a lumber yard that says a -- a few Jewish people working over there, I -- I couldn’t speak nothing in English, you know. He said, maybe you want to work over here, I says good. So, next morning I went to work over there. And I worked there for a few months, and before [indecipherable] he came into me one day, he says, everybody likes you over here. I want you to be the buyer to buy the lumber. I said, buy the lumber for what? I don’t know how to talk. How do you gonna buy it? He said, well, I'll hire, I got a girl over here, a Polish girl, and she’ll work with you together. You do the buying. I says, you’re making fun of me. He said no. So, before I turn around they made me the foreman, then I started doing the buying in the lumber yard.

  <p id="541">
   Q: What did you speak? What language?
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   A: Mostly Jewish, and Polish.
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   Q: But you -- so you knew Polish?
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   Q: But -- but not English or German?
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   A: No, not enough English, nothing. So, we worked there for awhile, and came back Christmastime, and I couldn’t go, I couldn’t drive, I didn’t have no license or nothing. So a guy used to pick me up all the time, take me back to work. And this was about 20 miles. But the guy was nice to doing it, because [indecipherable] the boss in there. But by about two years I was working over there, and everybody find out with me I’m a good worker. And they don’t pay me too much. As [indecipherable] pay me 50 dollars a week, seven days a week, and I didn’t care, I make maybe [indecipherable] somebody else [indecipherable] 75 dollars a week. So I go back to him, I tell, Harry, I says 75 dollars. He says, Do-Don’t worry about, Pll give you 75. And then I want -- had -- need a car, so I got -- I got [indecipherable] license, I bought an old car, and I have to pay for the car, it’s 800 dollars. I haven’t got no money. So they say, we’re gonna loan you the money, and we’ll take off 20 dollars a week for your salaries. Okay. So it goes by a week, two, three, they’re not taking out the money. So I go back to him, I says, wait a minute, I can’t afford it, you didn’t take out the money. [indecipherable] the money, you’re supposed to take it from the -- my salary. Said, no, no, no, you cannot do it. He says, you have to pay right now for the four weeks. Well, okay, I have to, I have to, take it all, the whole thing, you know. And then [indecipherable] he said no, don’t worry about it, the car is a present for you. You know, that made -- made a -- a big deal, yeah. And [indecipherable] open up the lumber yard [indecipherable] the two partners. They fight -- fighting between them and he come to me and says to me, you know what? We closing up the place. I want you to go into business. You take over the place. I says, I’m gonna take over the place? I ain’t got no money. Then he says, well, we'll work it out somehow. So, he went, he brought me another guy, he says, that guy’s gonna go in partners with you. So another guy comes in the partners and start talking to me. He say, we’re gonna go into business, does he have any money. I says no, do you have any money? He says no. So what are we going? Says well, the people what you deal with them with buying, go into Mr. Martin, tell him that you want to go into business. So I go and tell the guys they’re gonna go in business. He says okay -- I-I -- I was buying for them. He says, show me your statement. I said, what’s a statement? I didn’t know nothing [indecipherable]. So I stayed with them for awhile, then I stay with a partner, and going to the -- to the banker that didn’t know me from somebody -- from the other people. I said the same thing, I want to go into business, but I need money. Said the same thing, give me a statement. So, I don’t know what you’ re talking about. Make the story short, the guy gave me 3,000 dollars credit, [indecipherable] give me 3,000 dollars credit. And we got [indecipherable] in the business, had good customers, the [indecipherable] was a big builder and he paid me every week. So I got in business and that’s -- I’m still in the same business.

  </p>
  <p id="647">
   A: Oh, it -- I always do, when they ask me with something. They were never too much interested, but the few times when I told one grandson and he asked me, he was very enthu -- he’s working for me for the summer. And I take him out to lunch once in awhile [indecipherable] Grandpa, so how did you survive? What did you do, how did you do? Just start talking to him. Then you talk to the other one, the other one came to me, he says, well, you talked to David, and you never tell me, I’d like to find out, too, from you. I said, I cannot tell you today, I’m not in a good mood. And I didn’t tell him that day, and he goes back to the mother, says, I asked Grandpa, and he wouldn’t say nothing to me. So they pass by another month or two, and it happened we talking about something, and I say, okay Michael, you asked me about something before, and I could tell you right now. Nobody’s here, it’s a quiet place. And I start talking to him. But he asked me to tell him that day, no. Now the same thing was -- today [indecipherable]. 15 years ago my sister begged me to do it, I said well, maybe I’Il do it someday. And somebody asked me to do it, the rabbi. I says, I-I’ll do it, I'll do it, don’t worry about it, never done. I didn’t want to bring it up even.
