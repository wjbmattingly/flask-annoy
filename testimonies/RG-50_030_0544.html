  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Do you have any early memories at all?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: I see. Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother.
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: My mother was a tsohn(ph) doctor, and my father was a tsohn(ph) doctor.

  <p id="30">
   Q: A dentist family.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Yes, a dentist family.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: And what, at that point, when you moved to Nesvizh, was it part of Poland, or part of Belarussia?
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Well, we came to Nesvizh, we changed our country from Soviet Russia to Poland, where both of my parents were citizens of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: How did they become citizens of Poland? Were they from there originally?

  <p id="38">
   Q: Russia. Of course, of course. And so, what prompted them to move to Nesvizh in 1921? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: The great [indecipherable] connected with the revolution in Russia, made the life very hard, and many Jews at this time, who had citizenship from another country, tried to go there. And because my father was born in Nesvizh, and my mother was born in Wilno, so both were born at the territory of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Yes. Yes. Did you have brothers and sisters?
  </p>
  <p id="41">

  <p id="42">
   Q: So he was older than you?

   A: I brought it if now from Lithuania, from a sanitarium, where there were some people from White Russia, and when I told them that I know Nesvizh they were very excited and they send me photographs of Nesvizh, how Nesvizh looks now. And they called Nesvizh the pearl of White Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   Q: And why is it so? Why — why is Nesvizh so special?
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   A: I think that mostly thanks to the family of the Radziwells, because they heard in Nesvizh there might be a big palace. I don’t know if there is a second such in the former Poland. And around the palace was a beautiful park. And the Catholic priests brought Italian artists, who painted the churches in Nesvizh. So, it was a small town, but some very excellent in architecture, in culture, and in Jewish life, too.
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   Q: In what way — what was special in Jewish life in Nesvizh?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="153">
   Q: Ah, ah.

  </p>

  <p id="166">

  </p>
  <p id="171">
   Q: Before — November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   A: Jan Grodis(ph). The last name looks maybe that he was Lithuanian, Grodis(ph), maybe.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   Q: Possible.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   A: And he was super tolerant to other nationalities. Super tolerant. He was a priest, and the priests mostly had some feelings not the best against not Catholics. But he was a different Catholic, and the big priest doctor professor Jan Grodis(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   Q: And he was — was it a public school, the — this gymnasium?

  </p>
  <p id="203">
   Q: Mm-hm. November 24, 2009

  </p>
  <p id="214">
   A: Yes?
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   Q: Let’s talk about Vilnius, where you also lived, in the 1930s.

  <p id="218">
   A: My mother was only in one thing unhappy, that it was so many dentists in Vilnius, and she was already an old lady, at this time she was close to 60. It is very old.

  <p id="221">
   Q: Difficult.

   A: Yes. So, we went to different small cities and I was the geographer, very responsible for my job, so we went to Landvaroof(ph), Kujainietz(ph), Iwje, Sobotniki and what, may — maybe 15 different places, and usually the technique was such that my mother wrote to the pharmacist, and the pharmacist answered that there is no dentist, and a second, very important question, is there a forest?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   Q: And why is that? Why would be a forest important?
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   A: The forest is important, who 1s living in a forest, especially in a pine forest, we’ ll have excellent lungs. And until now I have excellent lungs.

  <p id="236">
   A: She wrote letters to me, and she send me food, to the army.
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   A: And my friends in the army said they never saw such big animals with such good food. And everything stopped. The lit — the lit — Italians came to Vilnius, and they knew that Vilnius had a second name, Jerusalem of Lithuania. So they began to destroy absolutely the Jewish population in Vilnius. And one of my friends, Jergus(ph) Kowalski(ph) was immediately killed.
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   Q: One of your friends, Jergus(ph) Kowalski(ph) was immediately killed. November 24, 2009

And I met Kowalski’s(ph) brother already, after the war.

  <p id="247">
   Q: And your mother, was she in Vilnius, or was she in this tow — small town when all —
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="253">
   Q: Okay. November 24, 2009

  <p id="255">
   Q: It was okay.
  </p>
  <p id="256">
   A: — it was easier than in Vilnius.
  </p>
  <p id="257">
   Q: What happened to her?
  </p>
  <p id="258">
   A: She was killed by the Germans. I received a letter from a Jewish doctor Melamed(ph) from Iwje, and he wrote, kill the Germans, kill the Germans. Your mother, together with other intelligentsia went to someplace — I don’t remember what is the name of the place — and was executed.
  </p>
  <p id="259">
   Q: Where were you when you got this letter? Where were you when you got this letter?

  </p>
  <p id="265">
   Q: So were — this was — you got the letter before the blockade?
  </p>
  <p id="266">
   A: It was already the blockade, because when the Reds came to Iwje, they came to eastern Poland. And when they came to eastern Poland, the western part of Soviet Russia became — November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   Q: That’s right. The —
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   A: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   Q: — it got ex — yeah, it got extended.
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   A: Finished, miss Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   Q: Now, here’s a question. You mentioned your father was the head of the Zionists in Vilnius.
  </p>
  <p id="272">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   Q: As you were growing up, in your childhood, in your — in your teenage years, did you have any political interests at all? Were you interested in politics? Did you identify yourself to any particular group?
  </p>
  <p id="274">
   A: My beloved organization was Hashomer Hatzair. From Hashomer Hatzair, most of the Shomerim took part in every fight against Hitler. And how you see on many of the photographs, I am with the Hashomer. This is my political organization.
  </p>
  <p id="275">
   Q: Tell us — tell us a little bit more about these organizations, so that people who are listening to this in the future would understand what they were.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   A: Hashomer Hatzair was beloved by my father because he was a Zionist, and this was the most developed youth organization for Zionists. So he loved Hashomer Hatzair. And he told my mother that it is a good place for your son to be a Shomer. November 24, 2009 First she said, ah, I don’t know what kind of youth 1s there, that is different youth, good and bad and all that. But when he told her, she took it —
  </p>
  <p id="277">
   Q: Seriously.
  </p>
  <p id="278">
   A: Yes. And I was very close to Hashomer Hatzair because my father was the head of the Zionist organization.
  </p>
  <p id="279">
   Q: Did you have any other close relatives as you were growing up, with you? To me, I get the impression that it was only your mother and yourself, as a team. You’re the geographer, she’s the dentist. Were there any other people who were close to you at those years?
  </p>
  <p id="280">
   A: I will tell you, there is, in my biography a lot of details. But I will repeat the most important. My mother’s sister, Mina(ph) was a massage-ist in the Druskininkai. That’s why almost every year I am coming to the Druskininkai for two weeks, and I see some of the forest there, and for me is a great, tragic pleasure to see it. So, I went to the cemetery of people who were killed in Druskininkai. Most of the people were Russians, and there was written their military —
  </p>
  <p id="281">
   Q: Rank.
  </p>
  <p id="282">
   A: Yes. And they saw that some other man is going on the same cemetery and is — he reads the inscriptions on the monuments. Well, I began to speak with him and he November 24, 2009 said that yes, | am from Druskininkai. I was a partisan against Hitler. All the Jews from Druskininkai were taken to Grodno and executed.
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   Q: That would mean your aunt as well.
  </p>
  <p id="284">
   A: And among them was my mother’s sister, the massage-ist, Mina(ph). In Nesvizh my mother had a brother, Zahar(ph). Zahar(ph) was killed in Nesvizh very fast, because the Germans had the impression that his son has sympathies for leftist. So he was executed almost immediately, maybe the second or third day in Nesvizh. He was a composer, and I have probably here some notes that he composed. And some of his songs, I know from my memory, and I would want to — to — to make some — some use of that.
  </p>
  <p id="285">
   Q: Could you sing something? Would you mind singing one of those songs? Do you mind singing one of them right now?
  </p>
  <p id="286">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="287">
   Q: Please?
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   A: Not the easiest songs.
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="290">
   A: The texts are Polish.
  </p>
  <p id="291">
   Q: It’s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="292">
   A: It’s understandable. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="293">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="294">
   A: Now, I am a very small singer.
  </p>
  <p id="295">
   Q: It’s okay, it’s okay. For us it’s very important.
  </p>
  <p id="296">
   A: Atango(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="297">
   Q: Atango(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="298">
   A: Atango(ph). [sings]
  </p>
  <p id="299">
   Q: Thank you, thank you, I know it’s not easy. But we care very much about the music that people created. And when — this is the music of the boy who was killed, then, almost immediately.
  </p>
  <p id="300">
   A: It was the [indecipherable] killed. His name is Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="301">
   Q: Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="302">
   A: Yes, Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph). Salomone(ph), we called him Moniek(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   Q: Moniek(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   A: Moniek(ph) Zarhe(ph). Everybody knew him, because in Nesvizh he was the director of a dancing and singing ensemble.
  </p>
  <p id="305">
   Q: When did you — when you found — do you remember when you found out about these different things? Was it when you were in Leningrad, or after the war? What happened to your Aunt Mina(ph), what happened to Moniek(ph), what happened to November 24, 2009 your mother. I mean, your mother is, you got the letter, but the other people who were close to you and dear to you, when did you find out about their fate?
  </p>
  <p id="306">
   A: Something I found from letters, like Dr. Melamud’s(ph) son from [indecipherable]. Somebody I found in Druskininkai already lately —
  </p>
  <p id="307">
   Q: Mm-hm, recently.
  </p>
  <p id="308">
   A: Yes, that they saw that all the Jews were executed in Grodno. From many people, I know who survived Nesvizh. For instance, I write to Israel, to a very old friend. The old friend fought with me under Leningrad, against Hitler, but I didn’t know about it, because under Leningrad you had a half million soldiers, wh-wh- who knows? And this was the photograph of the Radziwells. His father was photographing everything what happens in the palace of the Radziwells.
  </p>
  <p id="309">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="310">
   A: And the Radziwells was not simple youks, but they had people in the royal family of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="311">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="312">
   A: So it was a very special family. For instance, around Nesvizh they had over a million hectares of ground, except the palace, with the park, with everything. Now, from Nesvizh — so, I receive letters until now from the friend from Israel. He was very hard — November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="313">
   Q: Wounded, or something?
  </p>
  <p id="314">
   A: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="315">
   Q: Wounded, was he wounded, did he have injuries?
  </p>
  <p id="316">
   A: He — he — he couldn’t walk, al-al-al-almost — almost he couldn’t. His wife died a short time ago, she was a survivor from Romania. So, from him I know a lot. A lot I know from the book, from Dr. Shalom Cholawsky. Dr. Shalom Cholawsky wrote about Jewish partisans who fought against Hitler. And he was one of the heads of the Jewish partisans. And he’s — here is his photograph with his rifle. Dr. Shalom Cholawsky. So, from such —
  </p>
  <p id="317">
   Q: Sources.
  </p>
  <p id="318">
   A: — sources, I know something.
  </p>
  <p id="319">
   Q: So, let’s go back now to Leningrad.
  </p>
  <p id="320">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="321">
   Q: And tell us — tell me about what was your experience there. What was it like to be in the siege of Leningrad’? What kind of fighting happened?
  </p>
  <p id="322">
   A: You have to take [indecipherable] something, that’s my mother finished a Russian high school, and a Russian university in Kharkov, in Ukraine. And Russian, she said to everybody that Russia is my homeland. So I had some sentiments to Russian culture, to Tolstoy, to — to Chekhov. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="323">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="324">
   A: It is under-understandable. So, when I came to the Russian army, I found people who speak almost so well, how I am speaking Russian. And born in Nikopol’, so it is Russia. So, to en — together I am theirs, you know. So I have very strong sentiments to Russian culture, to the Russian people, but not to the Russian [indecipherable].
  </p>
  <p id="325">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="326">
   A: Because politics are very different, with a lot of facts, subjective facts. The Polish look different today, different they looked 15 years ago, so I try to be very neutral, and my politics is the politics of America.
  </p>
  <p id="327">
   Q: But in Leningrad in 1941, that’s the story I want to capture. Of a young man who’s 20 years old, or 19 years old, who’s in the Soviet army, and li— and you know, it’s hard time. I want to learn about what that was like.
  </p>
  <p id="328">
   A: Yes. In the gymnasium of Slovatski(ph) in Vilnius was a legya(ph), legya(ph), a legion of young people who had a military training. But not all the Jews were there. Some, if they were [indecipherable] but if they were young [indecipherable]. When they came to the Red Army, it was a training shooting. And I shot three times and I make 29 points.
  </p>
  <p id="329">
   Q: Is that good or bad? I have no idea. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="330">
   A: It is a very high result.
  </p>
  <p id="331">
   Q: So that means you’re a good marksman.
  </p>
  <p id="332">
   A: Yes. A man who speaks Russian, and who shoots 29 from 30 possible theoretically —
  </p>
  <p id="333">
   Q: Points.
  </p>
  <p id="334">
   A: Oh, okay. It was another training, who will put his gasmask faster than any other. So many made it in five seconds, in seven seconds. I made in one second and four. Ay. So they gave me on a good artillery position, thanks which I don’t hear you too well.
  </p>
  <p id="335">
   Q: If you had gotten 20, and not 30 - 29, maybe you’d hear me better, is that what you’re saying?
  </p>
  <p id="336">
   A: Probably, probably. Or not —
  </p>
  <p id="337">
   Q: Or not.
  </p>
  <p id="338">
   A: — or not.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   Q: You never, never know.
  </p>
  <p id="340">
   A: I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="341">
   Q: So, you were in the artillery, so that means front line, yes? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="342">
   A: So, it was artillery against German bombers. And sometimes we shoot well, and sometimes we shoot very badly. The first day, we shoot in — in — in a Russian plane by mistake.
  </p>
  <p id="343">
   Q: It happens.
  </p>
  <p id="344">
   A: It is different, you know. And when the Russians, at whom we shoot, found themselves a piece of a forest and were hiding, so we gave a commander to — to — to shot better. And they came to the [indecipherable] to our battery, and they said, no more planes.
  </p>
  <p id="345">
   Q: Good that they survived. At least that much.
  </p>
  <p id="346">
   A: So, was th-the — the begin of our great training. But, because we shot bombers, the head of our unit said, we anti-aviation artillery-ists, we are living a long time, so he said. Because, you know, they bombard a factory, and they don’t look on the battery of artilleries, they don’t need a battery of artilleries, they need a — to destroy the factory, or to destroy the civilian population in this city, on the market or something. So, the — the head of the unit told the truth. I think that he 1s still alive.
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   Q: Did you eat well during the siege?
  </p>
  <p id="348">
   A: This was the most terrible thing. At home I weighted 66 kilograms. In the army, I weighted 39 - 37. I looked more like a dead man. The hunger was terrible. It is terrible. It is weeks and weeks and months and months, almost nothing eating. I November 24, 2009 have an excellent book, he has the book, where the author wrote the true face of the blockade of [indecipherable]. It is the one book where there is no subjective to — to much moments. He wrote how it was, everything. It is — it 1s terrible. You are walking through the streets and you are seeing dozens of dying people. This author said that in the hunger in Leningrad died one million population. One million; not military, civil population. And he said that the history doesn’t know a second such case that 900 days you don’t give up, and Hitler can’t take Leningrad. The marshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to build a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer. And we did, 20 years old guys, we said no. No. Ended. No was true.
  </p>
  <p id="349">
   Q: No stones for — yes. So what was it that you did eat? What was it that you did eat?
  </p>
  <p id="350">
   Q: This author wrote exactly, I will tell you for an example. 15 grams sugar, it is not a full teaspoon. Around 20 pounds fat, but who knows what kind of fat it is? From a dog, or from a — from a cow? Who — who — who knows what it is? No bread, but instead of bread, sukardi(ph). It’s made — it means pieces of bread baked on — on — on fire, you know. So people said that the material for the — for the bread is the rest from food for horses, for cavalry. But the horses died from hunger a long time ago, and they make — made bread for the population. What is there more? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="351">
   Q: I’m tal — but you, is there something you remember eating? This is the same thing —
  </p>
  <p id="352">
   A: This is — this was my — my eating, but it came a better time, as they send my unit to the lake of Ladoga.
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   Q: Where is that?
  </p>
  <p id="354">
   A: Ladoga is the largest lake in Europe. It is between Finland and between Russia. The Finnish said that all Ladoga has to belong to them, and the Russians say that all Ladoga has to belong to the Russians. On the Ladoga were points where trucks winter were going through the snow and the ice, through the Ladoga, through the — with some food. And we didn’t have a lot work to fight to the Germans, so we had enough time to help the civil population. So, we could —
  </p>
  <p id="355">
   Q: Get some food.
  </p>
  <p id="356">
   A: — something what fell on the — on the ground, or something to — but to take something from a truck, dead. Everybody knew, don’t touch it. The Ladoga has 42 kilometers, such trees were from a — one side were the Finns, and on the other side the Russians.
  </p>
  <p id="357">
   Q: And were you shooting at each other at that time, the Finns and the Russians, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="358">
   A: What? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="359">
   Q: At that time, when you were in Ladoga, were the Finns shooting at the Russians or not, and the Russians shooting at the Finns?
  </p>
  <p id="360">
   A: I would say that the Finns wanted to look more gentlemen than the Germans. I feel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora — territory than the Germans. I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the walls, where is safer to — to walk. So, if you look what is written, it 1s written so, like most of the shells would come from the dort — from the Finns. Less from the Finns and more from the south.
  </p>
  <p id="361">
   Q: From the Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="362">
   A: From the Germans. I have a such impression. And the author of the book writes that the dictator of Finland was a administered by the tsar in Russia. So, he even told — maybe it is a fantasy, but he told the Finnish army that he was the dictator, but don’t touch [indecipherable].
  </p>
  <p id="363">
   Q: Ah.
  </p>
  <p id="364">
   A: So, it was some easier situation.
  </p>
  <p id="365">
   Q: How long were you there, at Lake Ladoga?
  </p>
  <p id="366">
   A: A winter of minus 40 Celsius, minus 47.
  </p>
  <p id="367">
   Q: Oh yay, oh yay. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="368">
   A: That’s why I pray from — for Roosevelt. He gave us warm shoes. It was more important than anything else. Churchill didn’t do it, but Roosevelt. So, with the good shoes, we ate a little more, and someday I was taken, together with 15 — 16 other Polish Jews, and sent back to the city to — sent to the city of Leningrad back. I came back, it was after a winter of Ladoga, I came back to a reserve unit, and the reserve unit, some people who didn’t like too much amho — too much Jewish people. Ah, they are all Polish, send them to Poland back. We’re organizing a Polish army, a leftist army. So, in the reserve unit I was taken to, after a winter of Ladoga, and I came to the Polish army, and in the Polish army I fought in many places.
  </p>
  <p id="369">
   Q: Such as?
  </p>
  <p id="370">
   A: In such places like — I didn’t sleep too much. Schneidemwuhl.
  </p>
  <p id="371">
   Q: Was that already east Russia?
  </p>
  <p id="372">
   A: Schneidemunhl, it is in western Pomerania. It is the western part of today’s Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="373">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="374">
   A: On the Baltic Sea. So, the Germans, when we was closer to Berlin, being stronger and stronger, and they took already all the people to the army an-and — and too young, and too old, and too — everybody understood that the end will come. November 24, 2009 Now, and with the Polish army, I took part in the fight for Warsaw, until ’45, May two, I fought in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="375">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="376">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="377">
   Q: What are your memories from there?
  </p>
  <p id="378">
   A: Mm?
  </p>
  <p id="379">
   Q: What can you tell us about your experience there?
  </p>
  <p id="380">
   A: The Germans had a very strong discipline in the army. Very strong discipline. And the Hitler youth organization elevated them, the young people was tigers. Young girls 14 years old, were standing in the windows and shooting into the Soviet tanks. But Zhukov had this time more force, more planes, more artillery. I was an inspector over in the — 1n the army, so I was sent to different units, and among the units were such shells and artillery, that when you s — closing to the — to the gun, it was a hundred thun-thunders, not one thunder, a hundred thunders. That’s why my hearing 1s a such one, but when I was still young, 1t was okay. When I became very old, is not okay.
  </p>
  <p id="381">
   Q: Tell me, the Soviet army — you were in the Polish army, not the Soviet army. But the Soviet army did not have the best reputation as it went westwards, dif — firing on the retreating Germans. And the bad reputation was generally borne by the November 24, 2009 female civilian population. The Soviet army had a reputation of raping its way westwards to Berlin. Do you know, did you see any of that?
  </p>
  <p id="382">
   A: I saw many such cases. In comparison with what Hitler did in one White Russia, can you forget about everything else? Because they didn’t leave White Russia at all. No one house was in — 1n a normal shape. Nothing was. It — it was Sahara. So, to — to compare if a young Russian tried something, yes, it is very bad, sure, sure. And Zhukov gave very hard penalties for such things, very hard penalties. The head of our unit and Soviet chemical specialist had something to do in Warsaw. In Poland the — they behaved a lot better than in other places. So he got three months in a — 1-1-1n a special —
  </p>
  <p id="383">
   Q: Prison?
  </p>
  <p id="384">
   A: In a special unit.
  </p>
  <p id="385">
   Q: Oh.
  </p>
  <p id="386">
   A: Where the unit was all the times sent on the front, you know. And he came — came alive. It 1— it 1s — it is a— a very big problem, but every war brings true crimes. Every war.
  </p>
  <p id="387">
   Q: Did you, as you were — before you went into the Polish army, or as you were going westwards, did you go through Belarus, did you see Nesvizh? Did you see anything of your former life while you were still in the army”? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   A: When I was in the army, I didn’t see exactly the places where I was before, because w-we went around Warsaw and from Warsaw in Pomerania, close to the Baltic Sea, I was never there before. So, I can tell only like about this author of the book, and about Russian people, who told me what there was. In — in White Russia, if a Jewish partisan was caught, they killed all the village, burned all the village, and their pro-pro-pro-pro-pro acquaintance were killed. It 1s impossible to d — to describe. One word, and you perished, you know. And I saw in White Russia [indecipherable] I didn’t leave any, but [indecipherable] didn’t exist. Didn’t exist absolutely.
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   Q: Yeah, I know.
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   A: And, when after the discipline, the German discipline finished, oh, we like every [indecipherable] I wa — I was one moment the commander of the first Polish army, send me to find Greek prisoners. Where to look for them? Nobody knows. Okay, bu-bu-but —
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   Q: Where were you — where were you? Were you in Warsaw then, or in —
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   A: It finished the war, maybe a week after finishing the war.
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   Q: And you were in Berlin? The week after you finished the war, where were you located?
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   A: I forgot the name. A small town maybe 20 kilometers from Berlin. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   Q: Okay, you were in Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   A: So I want to — to turn back and to tell you about all the picture.
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   Q: Oh, let’s — oh, but — but if you were in the — you — let’s do it the Greek prisoners. I was just trying to get a sense of where they were. You were se-sent to find Greek prisoners, around this small town in — near Berlin, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   A: Na -— here 1s Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   Q: Yeah, yes, I know. I don’t have Berlin. So, did you find them?
  </p>
  <p id="400">
   A: Yes. The commander gave me an excellent new Austrian car with fashion. And, look for the Greeks. I look on this route, on this route, 20 kilometers farther, 60 kilometers farther, no Greeks. In one place I see a German lady, an old lady. I thought, maybe you know something about the Greek prisoners. I don’t know, but I saw prisoners in strange —
  </p>
  <p id="401">
   Q: Uniforms.
  </p>
  <p id="402">
   A: — uniforms. Maybe they are the Greeks. Where are they? La — three kilometers from here. I took her to my car, and we brought to the place that she — around there were Greeks. So I begin to tell them that I am from a classic gymnasium and that I know ancient Greek. Ohh, excellent, excellent. And they began in Latin [speaks Latin here]. This is Latin. That — that is taken from Greek, okay. Or — or Homer. And I began in Greek, wh-who 1s your head here? The head, we will call him, but November 24, 2009 he doesn’t like to — to — to — to, you know. Who 1s it? He says, General Mitalas. He was the former Greek Minister of Defense. How he came to the Germans? The Italians, who couldn’t take Greece, took him. Was a prisoner. And when they, under the pressure of the Americans, they had to go out from — from Italy, they left Mitalas there. Okay. So I told in Greek to Mitalas a big part of “The Iliad” and I asked him, do you understood what I said? He said, no. How 1s it possible? A former minister doesn’t know Greek? Homer? He said, now is a big difference in the Greek pronunciation and Greek spelling, and I don’t know it, he said. Ancient Greek, who knows — knows? Only a great aristocrat. So I am the great aristocrat. And I took him with my excellent car. Ah-hah, first the car came to Berlin, to the gates of the city. Berlin looked very well, not destroyed anything, well, what is it? But when I went inside the city, closer to the center, was more and more and more, and close to the Reichstag —
  </p>
  <p id="403">
   Q: Nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="404">
   A: Yeah. Okay. So, one of the soldiers, of the Soviet soldiers, “Stop!”” Why? Nobody can enter here. Okay, but look whom I have here in car. He looked in car and stood immediately like he would see God, because the Greeks had on their uniforms, the same things like the Russians, with the gold, and all that. And he November 24, 2009 allowed us to enter the city. So I enter to the city, and I went to the Reichstag. Went to the Reichstag and I saw Goebbels lying on the — on the —
  </p>
  <p id="405">
   Q: No kidding?
  </p>
  <p id="406">
   A: — sidewalk.
  </p>
  <p id="407">
   Q: How did you know it was Goebbels?
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   A: Because he was burned, and people told already that he was thrown away.
  </p>
  <p id="409">
   Q: I thought Goebbels was burned together with his wife and seven children?
  </p>
  <p id="410">
   A: Yes, he killed six children, he killed his wife, and he killed himself.
  </p>
  <p id="411">
   Q: But only he — you only saw his corpse, you didn’t see the — the rest? You didn’t see the wife and children?
  </p>
  <p id="412">
   A: No, I saw only him. Probably the children and the wife were somewhere else. The Greek former minister said, what kind of language do you know? I told, I know several languages. French do you know? Yes, I know. And from this moment on, we spoke with Mitalas —
  </p>
  <p id="413">
   Q: In French.
  </p>
  <p id="414">
   A: — French. And I brought Mitalas to the forest, where he was with 900 other Greeks. And he said about me, I don’t know why [indecipherable]. And he was very glad that I showed him Berlin. And Berlin was, the center city was destroyed, November 24, 2009 because the Metro in Berlin, Hitler burned. And in the Metro were thousands and thousands of Germans who died there, because he thought that the Red Army —
  </p>
  <p id="415">
   Q: Will come.
  </p>
  <p id="416">
   A: — will go through the Metro too.
  </p>
  <p id="417">
   Q: So these — you found Mitalas and you found a few Greeks around him, but not the 900. These were soldiers, these were — who were the other Greeks who were with the —
  </p>
  <p id="418">
   A: From a colonel up.
  </p>
  <p id="419">
   Q: So these were high officers.
  </p>
  <p id="420">
   A: High officers, and a Soviet delegation came to my Polish unit and took them away to Odessa. And all the Greeks, how the author of the book, and how it is true, came to Odessa do — to Greek back.
  </p>
  <p id="421">
   Q: I see, I see. What a — I mean, but what an adventure.
  </p>
  <p id="422">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="423">
   Q: What an adventure. So how long did you stay in Berlin?
  </p>
  <p id="424">
   A: In Berlin, maybe two months.
  </p>
  <p id="425">
   Q: And what happened to you after that? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="426">
   A: After Berlin, the first Polish army became the fourth Silesian army, and we went to Katowice. And we came to the biggest city in Silesia, where there is coal, where th —
  </p>
  <p id="427">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="428">
   A: Yes. And the army number four begin to stay in Katowice.
  </p>
  <p id="429">
   Q: Were you still an inspector at that time, or were you — have some of the
  </p>
  <p id="430">
   A: No, tha-that was — n-n-no inspector, because it was not a job. Something from the generals who knew me send him.
  </p>
  <p id="431">
   Q: What was your rank in the army, in the Polish army, what was your rank?
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   A: I was one step from a colonel.

  <p id="433">
   Q: How do say that in Polish?

   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   Q: The lieutenant colonel.
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   A: But I was already a full colonel. I was a full colonel, but my father was a Zionist, and they took back. Zionist.
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   Q: [indecipherable] November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   A: And some friend explained that, what do you want, in Poland is a different situation, and the [indecipherable] yes, some of them have sympathies to Marx or — or something, but not typical for them, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   Q: It’s true.
  </p>
  <p id="442">
   A: No. Zionist, it was like toothache to — to tell something that you have a — you’re a criminalist. Zionist. And they took it back. And the guy died probably, a long time ago. He had a— a charming wife, a wife of a Polish general, but a Russian Polish general. In tsarist time, when the Russians back east — back, they took factories and workers together. And among the workers was her father. Charming wife, but he, Zionist, he pronounced it so, that — that I would — I don’t know.

  <p id="443">
   Q: And what was his job, what was his rank? I mean, what was hi — what power did he have that he could take this away? Was he intelligence, was he KGB, was he what?

   A: Was an advisor in the government or something. I-I — I-I don’t know exactly. November 24, 2009

  <p id="449">
   Q: But he must have been a political — I mean, he must have looked for political purity, because —
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To tell that Stalin was not so smart? [laughter]
  </p>

   Q: So [indecipherable] what was li — what happened after?
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   A: After being in Katowice, I was not demobilized, but some of people were already demobilized. But th-the blockade of Leningrad and everything, some authority, you know, said to me, find seven girls who can write on the type — ty- typewriter. Okay. I found seven girls, and out of the seven girls 1s my wife.
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   Q: And that was in Katowice? That was in Katowice?
  </p>

   A: In Katowice.
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   Q: Did you ever go back to Nesvizh after the war? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   A: No, my friend, but I have with Nesvizh very strong contacts. Dr. Cholawksy, and one of the main workers in the — the Hebrew organization. An organization who has to do with the Holocaust —
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   A: —1s there, from Nesvizh. And another schlar(ph) was in gymnasium in Nesvizh together with me.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   Q: Did you — I guess my larger question is, did you go back to any of the places, whether it was Wilno, whether it was Nesvizh, whether it was the various towns you had been with your mother, after the war, to see what they looked like?
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   A: In general, not. But I was close to Ponary, and Ponary is a station close to Landwarow.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   Q: Lentvaris.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   A: Ponary is from Vilnius nine kilometers, and Landwarow, 18. How they say in rail line. So, in Ponary, the most — you can’t imagine what talents were destroyed. Poets and writers, and — and — and — and — it 1 — it is impossible to — to — to — to — to imagine. It is the — the grain of the Jewish family, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   Q: And you saw it right after the war? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   A: Yes, yes, yes. And when I go to Druskininkai, Vilnius was the — [indecipherable] in Vilnius were destroyed by General Chernikowski(ph). Chernikowski’s(ph) a Jewish guy.
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   Q: Oh.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   A: Yeah. But this is not the — the — the clue, you know. So, I came to Vilnius six, seven years ago, Chernikowski’s(ph) monument, hoo, and another monument 1s there. I go [indecipherable] but what 1s — what kind of ornament 1s it? On the street Mickiewicza is — on the wall of the court before the war in — in Vilnius, the Polish court, are names of young people who were killed. By whom they were killed, what is it? And the Jewish guy explained me, that the Lithuanians said that the Jews were criminals. That they killed the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians were Soviet spies. But I imagine that when the Polish Jewish Jews in Vilnius came back to their houses, and they knew from the population, from — from many other sources, who was the real spies for Hitler, they came to the Soviets, and the Soviets do what with the young, what they could do with somebody else. Or they could do with — with Russians, who were under such suspicion, you know. So, in Vilnius in [indecipherable] city on the street Mickiewicza is a such monument. So, you know, how controversial all — all that is, you know. How — November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   Q: When did you find out — you see, when you were talking to me before about how Belarus was no more, that it was a Sahara, that could be — that — that shows German brutality, Nazi brutality, collaborator brutality in wartime. When did you learn that there was something particular? When did you learn of the Holocaust? When did you first see the results that this was against the Jews, that this was a genocide?
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   A: Okay, I am very glad that you are asking about that. I’m very glad. The Holocaust was in several acts. Sometimes very late, and sometimes immediate. The immediate are Ponary, the Jerusalem of Lithuania. The immediate was Nesvizh, because in Nesvizh was a very hard Jewish community. An intelligent Jewish community in Nesvizh. And in Nesvizh they collected all the population on the market, maybe two weeks after [indecipherable] Nesvizh, and they killed everybody. There is maybe — maybe 10 people were —
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   Q: Survived.
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   A: Survived. And the White Russian peasantry was a lot more sympathetic to Jews than Polish. So, is it — so they destroyed almost all the Nesvizh community. And in one entry of a — of a very poor house 1n Nesvizh, stood a lady and took a girl from the —
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   Q: Line? November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   A: — from the thousands who were pushed like animals to [indecipherable] you know. And the girl was saved by the lady who took her. And she was married by my friend who is Yad Vashem, who is working there. And thanks her, he is still alive. He is over 90.
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   Q: Oh my, oh my.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   Q: But my question is again, a personal question. When did you personally, where were you when you realized that this was a genocide against the Jews? When did you find out, when did you realize this was not just war, and horrible war, but this was also a genocide?
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   A: First I have small signals. In the Soviet press, in the military Soviet press, a little about. And I slept with a Jewish guy, Schlitzer(ph) was his name. And Schlitzer shed — said, do you know that the Germans are killing all the Jews? I was very careful. All the Jews? Yes, all the Jews. Yes, I believe. I believe that they could it do, because I am from a classical gymnasium, and I know that the Latin poets said, horror Germanicus(ph). That the main feelings in Germany is horror Germanicus(ph). The Belgians are very nice people, but the Germans are a horror. Two thousand years write a Latin words that the main characteristic of Germans is horror. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   Q: Why were you careful around him, or why were you careful when he said that?
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   A: I told you yes, it is possible. It is possible. And it was finished, the dispute. If he was a schmekel, so he told somebody else about speaking with me. He was not a schmekel, so I told him the truth. It was the first klagator(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   Q: Yeah, the first notes.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   A: But when I heard more and more about that, and people are — are writing full pages and all that? Hey. So it is absolutely true. And when I ber — began to get news from Dr. Cholawsky, and news from the guy whose wife saves him, his life, and all that. So naturally it 1s absolutely true, and the news were brighter and brighter and brighter. And I came to Druskininkai, and from Nesvizh people told me that 6,000 Jews in Nesvizh were killed. It means hundred percent.
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   Q: Again, you learned that recently, you say, and I’m interested in after the war. Did you, in Katowice, when you met your future wife, did you already have an idea that this — that this was complete, that this was a full genocide?
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   A: In time of war?
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   Q: Right after the war, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   A: Or — immediately after the war?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   Q: Yeah. November 24, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   A: Immediately after the war, I was in the [indecipherable] lagers. Oh, I so close to Berlin, in Sachsenhausen. Sachsenhausen was a big — I came to the Sachsenhausen. It stinks everything, well, what is it? There are two — two — no — pietra. Q2: Two floors, two stories.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: Yes, and one man is sitting and holding his leg so. I told him, Et tu Francais? No. Zin sie deutsche? Nein. All right. [speaks foreign language here]
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Tell me what in — translate.
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: What are you doing here? I — I am asking him. He said, they made a conference of all the Polish intelligentsia. And all the professors of Jagiellonian University was on the conference, and immediately after the conference, they were to Sachsenhausen. And he is sitting there because he was —
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: At the conference.
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: O-O-O-On the — on the conference.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: That’s the scene, I don’t know if you seen the movie, “Katyn.” You should see this movie. It’s done by Andrzej Wajda. It’s about Katyn, but there is also a scene in the film of professors from Jagiellonian University going to this conference and then being arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen. So I — when I saw it, I did not know whether this was based on a factual story, or part of, let’s say, a narrative that November 24, 2009 you introduced into a film. And your grandfather just confirmed, you know, that it was based on a fact.
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: And after — a little after the war, when I received the letters from Melanid(ph) son, from the Dr. [indecipherable], I knew already a lot. I know already a lot.
