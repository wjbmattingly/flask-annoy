  </p>
  <p id="41">

  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   Q: Yeah, I feel the same way. Okay, let me just slate the interview. Today is -- What is the date today?
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: The 30th. November 30th.
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   Q: 1998. Steve Roland, in the home of Sol and Riya Lurie, in -- is it Monroe?
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: New Jersey. And it’s a little bit past 10:30 in the morning and I’m thrilled to be here, very honored to meet you both and thank you for having me.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   Q: And as I told you, the -- the -- this interview will be a little bit different than the one which I watched the video of. And it’s -- and it -- you can help me direct it. So if it’s going in a direction that you think 1s less important and you have something else you’d like to talk about, or just something you don’t want to talk about, then just let me know, we'll just go to [indecipherable] thing. SL: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Some of the questions I have for you are just some questions that I had that weren’t fully explained in the video, and then I have other questions that we’ ll start after -- after you left Buchenwald. O-One of the questions that I had was -- was, could you describe for me again, your perception of the -- the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in Kovno when you were very young? SL: Before the war, you’re talking?
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   Q: Yes, before the war, mm-hm. SL: Well, before the war, the relation between the Jews and the Gentiles was very good.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: I mean, they didn’t show no anti-Semitism, right. And never make -- like we had ra- Gentiles working for us, right? They were the finest pe-people you ever met. Even I used to play with the Gentiles, they was never say, hey you dirty Jew or things like that. Everything was friendly, except one -- we used to have a boy that used to take care on our property where we lived. He used to be a janitor. And when Hitler start to come in power, you know, and he used to listen to the radio, and he be -- this guy became very
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   Q: Mm. SL: Bec -- They became so anti-Semitic after that, 1t was just unbelievable. I guess ma- maybe because they didn’t like the Russians, because the Russian depressed them. So maybe because of that, but they were such a -- so anti-Semitic, they were worse than the Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: I -- I know this 1s something you can’t really answer, but how do you explain that? How do you explain that sort of general getting along and then this in-incredible betrayal? SL: I don’t know. Maybe it could have been jealously, because the Jewish people in Lithuania were we -- we -- pretty well off. And we -- we had the -- in -- in Lithuania --
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   Q: Yeah. SL: And -- And the Jew didn’t -- I mean, they used -- they even used to speak Yiddish in -- advertisement in the street used to be in -- in -- in Yiddish. We used to have Yeshivas there and we -- we had the very sh -- very famous Yeshiva in Slobotka was ve-very famous. And I guess maybe it was jealousy. And I guess when the Germans came in and they were -- they were the -- they were depressed into the Russians and the Jews owned -- owned a lot of things, the chance to take everything away from the Jews. Maybe that’s where they turned. Because -- Because the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Estonians and the Ukrainians, they were worse than Nazis. They were -- All the killing, actually, was done by them. Very few Germans that -- that did the killing. All the dirty work was done by them. Even be -- When the -- When the Germans came in and all the pogroms was done by the Lithuanians. The Germans din -- We were come -- We were ra -- We ran away, you know, when the bobocart, and we start to run towards the German -- to the Russian border. And what happen, there were a lot of bombardments on the road and we were going by horse and wagon, you know, and the Germans were mechanized and next day they passed us already. So we stopped in a small town, I don’t remember the name of it, and you know, they told us that we have to back where we came from. And while we were going back, on the roads, the Germans stopped us and ask us where are we going. So we told them we’re going back to Kovno. So they told
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: An-And how do you explain this message from the Germans? Why did they -- Why did they do that for you? SL: They won’t -- I tell you, they di -- all those killings, that they weren’t that bad in the beginning of the war. The mass killing started in 19 four -- in -- in -- late in ‘41. That’s when the mass killings started, and actually, the-they started -- the --the -- all the killings were in -- 1n the -- in the Kovno ghetto in Lithuania. They we --the -- that’s where all the experimentals -- the killings started.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   Q: What -- What were these experiments? SL: Well, to see how the -- how they used to gather all the Jews and they used to get them in certain places and just shoot them. Because, I have a book about it, you know, and -- and that’s where -- that’s where they -- they claim that most experimental killing started in Lithuania.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: But I -- I don’t understand what the experiment was. Was it -- Was it to figure out -- SL: Mass -- Mass killing.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   Q: Was it to figure out that -- most efficient way to kill people?
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: While you were there? SL: Yeah. I was in the -- there was only -- there was only -- there was only about 5,000 Jews, from the Kovno Jews, Lithuanian Jews that survived the war. Out of -- Out of almost a quarter of a million Jews. And that included the -- the -- the ones that ran away to Russia. So, it’s just -- and I lost most of my -- my mother got killed the day before liberation.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   Q: Yeah, I know. SL: Mm. And my -- One of my -- my father’s youngest brother, he and the whole family went right in -- in -- in -- 1n the -- right in the beginning, when they took the first akcha. And they came -- Made us gather on a -- on the parade ground. And there’s a [indecipherable] was go -- like Mengele, like in the -- in the be -- in the -- in being the Birkenau.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: He was calling us a whole day, who -- who should live, who should die. You take as -- this side and you -- you -- if you were on the left you were safe, on the right you went to death. That day, out of 40 -- 42,000 people, one ti -- one quarter of the people went to the -- it’s called a nightfort, and that was the killing ground. So over 10 -- over 10,000 people went to the -- in that ca -- get killed.

  </p>
  <p id="67">
   Q: Mm-hm. And then how many got killed that day in -- well, that -- at the nightfort? SL: Well, the nightfort that time was just one of my uncles with the whole family and my aunt and her husband and two -- and two daughters. The rest they didn’t tak -- they didn’t take, because, see my father used to work brin-bringing in food, also. Like we were -- we were on the bia -- on the oxia there, and what happened, they told us to go on the right hand side. And my father was out of the ghetto and when he came back,

It’s -- The af -- The affection is not there, the closeness isn’t -- not there no more, because for so many years -- you didn’t see somebody in 40 years or so, you know.

  </p>
  <p id="93">
   Q: It is. SL: Yeah. Even I myself, I mean, the way I came out. Most of the people, you know, was mentally and a lot of them just had problems, but thank God.
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Well, I was going to ask you about this later, but let me -- let me ask you now and then I’ll go backwards. Explain to me -- wa -- one thing that -- that wasn’t -- that I didn’t understand when I listened to your -- your story, when you left the children’s home in France and went to look for your father and brothers -- SL: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   Q: And you found out that they had left Germany on [indecipherable] SL: When they went to Lithuania, yeah, in 1945.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: Tell me what happened when you found that out. How -- Tell me again how you found out and what you reaction was and why you decided to go back to France? SL: Well, I meant -- I met somebody, right? And we start to talk, you know. So he says, “Where you from?” So I told him, I says, “I’m from Kovno.” He says, “Did you have pe-,” my name, he says, “You know, I met somebody, Simon Lurie, right?” “Yeah,” I said, “that’s my father.” He said because there was -- af-after liberation -- they were
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And while I was on the train, I met this guy.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: On the train to? SL: I was going to -- to Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   Q: Right. SL: Going to Dachau, and he -- he told me that the -- you -- you -- masta -- met this guy and they start to talk, you know? And there was -- he -- he says, “Where you going?” I say, “I’m going to see my brother and my -- my brother’s and my father. We’re going to meet.” Because it’s -- and it’s -- he told me, he asked me what’s the name. He said, ““No, they went back to Kovno.”
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: So why did you decide to go back to France instead of trying to go to Kovno? SL: Well, listen, I didn’t know where they were in Kovno, right? And I know the Communists were no good already, right? So this way I know where I was.
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: To come -- SL: Beca-Because after -- after I -- when -- what I -- the way I knew how to take care of myself already.
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Because it’s not like they -- the children here these days and they -- in America, you know, a -- a 10 and 11 year old is a baby, a 20 year old is a baby. You have to ge -- You have to take of them like a babies. The children that survived during the war, were not babies. At eight years old they were not babies no more.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Well, was that a difficult decision for you to make? Did you have to stop and think about it? SL: No, I didn’t. I knew it -- not difficult.
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   Q: When you were on the train and you found out that your father was back in Kovno -- [indecipherable | SL: Yeah. It wasn’t a difficult decision at all. Just -- Listen, this is spur of the moment.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: But you were going -- you had to back to France first. Was your plan already to come to the United States? SL: No, no, no. That was a little later. What happened, we were on the children’s home and somebody came from the Red Cross. And we were talking about it and I remember my grandfather should rest in peace, he went to see his children in America, 1934. Now
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   Q: You were still in France? SL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: And who -- And who wrote -- SL: Said they decided -- They as -- They ask me if I want to come to America. Listen, I was alone anyways, right? I said, “Definitely.” So they made out papers for me, it took almost -- almost about two years, a year and a half or so, a little more than a year and a half or so, til they brought me over here.
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   Q: Well, just explain to me so I understand it, cause I -- an-and I -- I’m -- I don’t mean to be -- to be challenging you, I’m just curious why you weren’t trying to get back with your fo -- with your father, and when -- and at what point did you find out that your mother was [indecipherable] SL: Well, that we found out much later.
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Because my -- my aunt -- my cousins were telling me. That was many years ago. I didn’t know when -- when she died, see? But my aunt and my cousin, they were in the same camp. Then they were in Stutthof, and what happened, we’re -- had a cousin that was sick, some -- and they were liquidating the camp. So my -- my -- my -- my mother says, “I’m going with -- with -- with -- with my niece.” So my Aunt Hannah was [indecipherable], and my cousin Edka. Says, “Bazil, come with us. Leave her, she’s sick.” She says, “I can’t leave her alone.” And she wouldn’t leave her alone. Now, my aunt and my cousin survived.
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   Q: And your mother probably knew the consequence. SL: I don’t know if they knew or not, but they -- listen, e-e-eventually, I guess everybody knew.

   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they -- I -- I -- I understand they drown them in the -- and they drowned them. They sunk the boat. They put them all on the boat and they drowned them. Listen, my mother was a wonderful woman. She gave her life to be with her niece.
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   Q: But so -- so help me understand what was going on when you were in France and why -- why -- how it was that you decide to come to America and not to try to go back [indecipherable | SL: Well, I knew where the Russians were going there, okay? And then there were -- I didn’t want to go back to Russia, ma -- I knew before the war how they were and after the war, they were worse yet. So I didn’t want to go back to Russia. And first of all, I didn’t know if -- if I come to -- to Kovno, I know da -- what would it be, because in Russia you never knew. You could be in one place here and next day the-they -- they shipped you to Siberia. Here, I know where I was. And listen, I was very independent already, I could take care of myself. I guess it’s -- it’s fate, 1t’s destiny, it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be that way.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: But I guess what -- what you -- 1s it accurate to say that this is two different reactions to the murders that you saw and that you knew how murderous the Russians could be, that your father and brother wanted to go back for some reason and you didn’t want to go back. SL: Well, they wanted to go for a certain purpose. My brother and sister, they wanted to go look for my mother
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   Q: Yeah. SL: [indecipherable] They didn’t know what the c-consequences they went through.

  <p id="117">
   Q: This is an interview with Mr. Sol Lurie for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, November 30th, 1998, conducted by Steve Roland. This is tape one, side two. SL: -- letters and censor it, to see whether I -- and used to take maybe five, six months before I used to get a letter from them. If I wouldn’t a known what was going on in Russia, I might have gone back. But I knew what was going on there. And I tell you, when you went -- you go through a war like that, you become very selfish, too. You become very cold. Don’t know wh -- you look out it -- for yourself. It’s like an animal, survival. So if -- You’re not attached no more. The feeling 1s not there no more.
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: Le-Let me ask you this. You said in the -- in the other interview, that at a certain point, you made a very firm decision, that you would try to outlive Hitler.
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   Q: Or that you would outlive Hitler. SL: Yeah. Well, that’s how I survived.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: Tell me what made you -- what was it that pushed you to that decision, or how you came to that decision. SL: Well, I had a lo -- I always had a lot of willpower, all right? And the only way to survive, you have to do -- it’s something to look forward to, which is why -- once you give up, that’s it, right? So, if you make a goal in your -- in your own mind, I’m going to accomplish this, right? And -- And -- And -- And that’s when it -- that was my goal. I want to survive so badly and I made my goal that I’m going to outlive Hitler. And that’s what kept me going.
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   Q: So it -- How -- How important was that for -- like the difference between those who survived and those who didn’t survive? To have a goal like that, where that -- SL: The goal was very important, because if you haven’t got a goal, and you don’t set your mind on something, you’re not going to do it. So, there was so many times that ee- | pee -- I want -- you want to give up. But just the thought that I might outlive Hitler and ca -- when I went back to Germany -- [’Il tell you later about -- when I ba -- came -- went back to Germany in 1953, right? And I came back -- I came back as an American soldier in occupied Germany, I was the proudest human being you ever saw. Because I show you, you want to kill me, and I came back alive and I’m an American. That -- That was my pride. People said, “How could you love the Germans?” Right? But
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: You became an American citizen -- SL: American citizen in Germany, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   Q: Well, tell me about that. SL: Okay, when I was in the army, I went -- I went in the army, I wasn’t a citizen yet. So -- And they send me back -- send me into -- to Germany, instead of -- in the Korean war. And then they -- they -- they made a new -- a law that the -- the -- that if you’re in the army, you become a -- you going to become a citizen. I was one of the first ones to became an American citizen in Germany. So I we -- I went to Frankfort, in Ame- American headquarters, and that’s where I was sworn in as the American citizen. And it’s written on my discharge, too. So when I came -- when I first came back fa -- after the army, I came back to vote in the -- in the elections and I came into the -- when th- they asked you where did you get your American citizenship papers. I says, “I got it in Germany.” So the woman that there was registering me says, “Don’t be no wise guy. What do you mean you got it in Germany?” I says, “Lady, I got it in Germany.” She says to me, “If you don’t play around -- stop playing around, I’m going to call the cop, he’s going to throw you out.” I says, “Lady, you could call the United States army. That’s where I became an American citizenship.” And I took out my paper, you know, my si -- my American citizen paper and showed it to her. She thought I was kidding around.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: How important was it to you to become an American citizen? SL: Very important, I didn’t have to go to the army, but I went, because when I came to this country and I saw what the -- I know what the country did for me, the way I was treated. I had freedom, I could say anything I want, right? And I want to fight for this country, to preserve the -- [indecipherable] the freedom. I didn’t say the -- it’s a legitimate war, it’s not a legitimate war. When the country calls me, I went. I didn’t have to, but I went. I’m very proud of it, too.
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   Q: And do you remember that day, that moment when you became a citizen? SL: Oh yeah. I was very proud. Yes I was st -- I was standing -- I was the fi -- the only one, and when the headquarters of the -- the seventh army, I was the only one that -- that was sworn in as the American citizen that day. And I had -- I had the two or three witnesses from my company there, to be witnesses, sigh? I was very proud. I was also written up the Stars and Stripe. That’s where the -- That ne -- beca --

  <p id="126">
   Q: What is that, a -- a military newspaper? SL: Yeah, it’s an American newspaper.
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: That -- That -- That -- That’s a new law that came out.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Which it -- What was the law? SL: The law that once you serve in the army, right, you -- you’re the ma -- you become an American citizen. Because, see, they couldn’t send me in combat because I wasn’t a citizen. So they can send you in occupied terr -- if you volunteered, you could send you
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   Q: Because you weren’t citizens? SL: Yeah. Actually, I didn’t have to go, but I wanted to go.
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: Now, of all the places to go, was Germany a difficult place for you to go? SL: No, I -- I came back, I -- I was very proud, that I was telling you. I was very proud because I came back, I showed you, you wanted to kill me, you couldn’t do that and I came back as a -- an occupi -- occupied your country. That was my pride. I used -- And when used to walk in Germany as American soldier, I was like a hundred feet tall, like a giant. Felt great.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   Q: What -- Was there any -- What was the climate in the army for Jews? Was it -- Was it difficult? Was there any anti-Semitism [indecipherable] SL: No, no, no. First of all there was very little Jews in my company, right?
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: In the whole -- the whole regiment -- I was in the 26th inf -- the regiment, there was only about four Jews, that was it. So when it came to a Jewish holiday, we didn’t even know. I didn’t know when Yom Kippur was or Rosh Hashanah. But there was no anti-

  <p id="133">
   Q: So were -- were they surprised to find out not -- that all [indecipherable] New Yorker -- SL: Yeah, then -- I was very friendly with them.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Yeah. SL: I was ver -- I was very close with them. Had a lot of friends there. Listen, what people don’t know -- anti-Semitism is only ignorance. When you talk to -- When you -- When you tell people that don’t use their own mind. Don’t know how to make up their own mind. They don’t think for themself, that’s when anti-Semitism comes in.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And the person that doesn’t know nothing, 1s not anti-Semitic.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: I’m putting up a second microphone for my -- myself. When I record the interviews for my radio programs, I don’t record myself. SL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   Q: But for this one they asked me to and I forgot. I’m sorry. With the -- Let m -- I want to go ba -- I know we’re jumping around in time a little bit -- SL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: -- but I wanted to -- because we -- some of the important things to me, when I -- when I hear th -- your story and the other stories of survivors, is to understand what was special, what were -- what were the ingredients of their survival and I know part of it is- is luck. It’s just having -- SL: 99 percent was luck.
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   Q: Yeah, but -- SL: And somebody has to watch over you. I put -- See, I’m a very strong believer in fate.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: Yeah. SL: In destiny. And I believe somebody’s watching over you and you -- not-nothing’s going to happen to you before your time is up.
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: See, I p -- I personally believe in my grandfather, hey? He’s the one that watched all through the war over me.
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: Now ca -- You -- You mentioned that several times and this was a --
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   Q: -- the-these were the two things that I picked up from the interview that were very important, was one, your determination to live beyond Hitler, and then your being watched over by your grandfather. But could you explain how that manifests itself, or what it -- what it actually was, in terms of him watching you? SL: Well, see, when I was a child, I was very -- my grandfather used to live by us. I was very close to my grand -- whatever -- I was like a little dog, right? Whatever my grandfather went, I used to go with him. I used to go to shul with him, whatever. To my aunts, my s -- children, right, whatever. And I fe -- I was very close to him, see? And he was reu -- he was very close to me. He wa -- He loved me, [indecipherable] and -- I fi -- and that’s the only one, [indecipherable] I was a child and the way I felt, he was always there whenever I needed him, when I was a child, right? And the same thing during the war. I mean, there were certain -- certain things, like he told the guy, “You’ll never see to -- li-live to see that day,” right? The day before Hitler started the war, he died, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: How old was that guy that died, I forgot to ask you that. SL: That man?
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   Q: Yeah. SL: He must have been in his late 40’s. Young, young man.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Well he said, ““You’ll never live to see the day.” And that was a prediction, a couple of years before it.
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And the man never lived to see the day. So, there was something there. There’s so many -- There’s so many fi -- instance, you know, so many instances that I’ve -- I went through like a miracle. Nad in the war, and even after the war, the -- certain things. 19 f- 1987, right, I was walking around like a time bomb, I didn’t even know it.
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   Q: With your heart? SL: Right. Now, sigh -- like a miracle, my -- my -- my -- my right ar -- my right ventricle -- right ventricle? What do you call that? RL: Your right side of the heart. SL: Right side of the heart took off ma -- took over the work from my left heart, because my left one was completely closed. RL: The coronary artery. SL: Now, when you -- if you ever read the report, you would never believe it, right? The doctor wrote the report. My wife is a RN, right, and she couldn’t believe the report. Now, you don’t -- you mean to say that somebody’s not watching over me?
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Mm. Somebody’s watching over me. The same thing now. One of my -- my grafts closed up, right? But what happened, my -- my ha -- my body developed new ca -- carotical circulation around the heart, right, right. Somebody li -- 1f wouldn’t be for that, I would have had a massive heart attack.
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   Q: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   Q: Is there any connection between this strong belief that you have and this -- or this knowledge that you have of somebody watching you and -- and your religion? SL: Yeah, the religion has something. I’m not -- personally, I’m not religious.
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: I believe if you are a good human being, you have a good heart, you don’t harm nobody, you help people when they’re in need, that’s the most important religion. It’s nit -- It’s not what you -- It’s not what you -- you -- you -- you say abba, it’s what you do. If you do good things to people and you help people, that’s a religion for me.
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: It’s not if you go to synagogue or you go to church and you -- and you pray and you say that and then you come out and you steal people -- from people. That’s not religion. Somebody 1s in need, I’m there.
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: But was it -- What -- I guess what I’m curious about was tha -- I mean, that’s -- that’s an important distinction and -- and I would -- and -- and I think that it’s -- well, it’s -- it’s not an uncommon view. I mean, my family is the same -- of Jewish people who are not particularly religious, but have very strong sense of values and ethics.
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Pm not sorry for it.
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Kids were brought up right.
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   Q: And just -- How -- How did you -- This -- This sense of values that you got, who would you say was the most responsible for teaching that to you? Was it your -- your parents, your grandfather? SL: Well, my parents and my grandfather.
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Because it was in the home.
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Our doors were always open, even for the workers. Did -- Those -- Those -- The people that used to work for us, right? They were crazy about the gre -- my grandfather, my -- see, in Europe, everybody had a nickname, right? They gave everybo -- And my grandfather, they gave a nickname, Smogas -- Smugus. Now, in -- in Lithuanian, it’s -- it’s a huma -- a real human being guy, a real fine person. That’s -- Tha -- That Smugus means a very fine person.
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   Q: What was his real name?
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   Q: And this was -- whose father was he, your --
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   Q: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   Q: So what did you -- did you learn to cook from her directly, or you just --
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: Yeah? What’s his specialty? RL: Anything you want.
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   Q: Yeah. I like to cook, too.
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: I always liked it, when -- since I was little. SL: Pll let you taste my lasagna. It’s -- But, see something falls off. But the thing is, you see, we were brought up to respect people and -- and to help people. And that’s the way I was brought up and it stays -- it -- 1t stayed with me, see, because they -- they got in this country, right? I mean, they come from a bad environment, that’s why the children are bad. There’s no such a thing. It’s the house. It’s what the parents teach children. See, the -- All the Holocaust survivors, right, that survived the concentration camp, and the -- and the how as they saw, that a human li -- a human life didn’t have no value. Just like an ant, you step on it and kill it, right? I mean, everybody came out, they should have been killers and murderers, right? And everybody -- I would say 99 percent of the people that came out are very successful, respectful citizens, wherever they went. And they don’t -- I don’t know [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   Q: And what’s you explanation for that? SL: Because they had a good upbr -- upbringing in the home, the value.
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: Before? SL: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   Q: Now, see if you can explain something to me. I have two children who are six and 10 years old. My perception is that these issues of the values that we teach them, that my wife and I teach them, are very important and very big, because they don’t know that much. So I’m envisioning you at 11 - 12 years old, these values and these relationships
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And I was taught as a child, that no matter what you saw, after -- because you could teach somebody a certain age. After a certain age, that’s it, right? So, when you were taught at a cert -- my -- at my age, a yo -- young age, how to da -- how to be to people, how to respect people, right? That if you see a woman, you open the door for her, right? Or you see an older person, you get up and give the seat. And if you see a woman -- especially a woman, even if it’s younger than you, right? You get up and give the seat. And that’s what instilled in me, to show respect. And I s -- I still do it now. Even when I- | sit somewhere and I see a woman next to me, I get up and give her the seat. Or I go out and walk and I open that door, right? I’ll hold the door til si -- the person comes over. Now you see in young generations, right, the young people, they don’t even say thank you. Like it’s coming to them, because it’s taught in the home. There’s no res -- There’s no respect. Listen, [indecipherable] they see -- I must have this. Whatever they see, they must have, right? He grew up, he had two toys, was enough. You’re growing now, they’ve got hundreds and hundreds of toys, right? And it’s still not enough. And whatever the child wants, they pay. Listen, there’s no such thing, you must have it.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   Q: What I’m curious about is -- is how a child like yourself, or other children, who have such a -- such a good upbringing and such a respect for other people and for elder people, how do you then make sense of the -- the horrible things that -- that were fostered upon you and the horrible things that you saw? SL: You mean I ca -- well, I figured this, we [indecipherable] it had to be that -- I -- I's - | have a certain belief, you know, the questions here, where if there was a God, right? How could it let it -- things like this happen?
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Now my explanation is -- the way I think, that you don’t question what God does, first of all, re? And also, the worst punishment for a parent 1s when the li -- they punish a child, right? There ca -- can’t be nabarena -- the worse punishment than punishing a child. And God was punishing -- punishing the parents when they to -- when they -- when they punish the children.
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: So, that’s -- that’s one of the things. But you can -- you can’t take it, there’s no explanation. There’s no explanation whatsoever. You don’t question.
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Mm-hm. You were 13 when you were -- you were in a concentration camp when you turned 13, right? SL: Yeah, I was -- when I went into the ghetto, when the germ -- when the Germans came into, I was 11.
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   Q: Mm-hm. So we -- What did you -- Were you -- Were -- Were you Bar Mitzvahed? SL: Nah, Bar Mitzvahed?
  </p>
  <p id="178">
   Q: There was no way, right? SL: No Bar Mitzvah.
  </p>
  <p id="179">
   Q: Was that -- SL: I was always in hiding, because the children, used to take away.
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: Yeah. SL: I was taken away a couple of times.
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   Q: Was that a problem, to -- to -- to miss a Bar Mitzvah? SL: No.
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: It wasn’t important? SL: Who -- Who was thinking of Bar Mitzvahs?
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   Q: I don’t know, I’m just curious. SL: We -- We di -- We didn’t even have no shawls those days. We used to -- We used to pray in the -- in -- that nobody saw, hey’? You didn’t have no prayer books, you didn’t have no shawls. Listen, people with beards, they used to shave -- the Germans used to cut their beards off. You just -- You just -- Bar Mitzvah never bothered me.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: No. SL: Listen, the religion the -- hala -- it’s -- it’s not just the -- the only thing a Bar Mitzvah is, if you go before the Torah and they present you and you -- an-and you become a man. Over here they make a big thing, Bar Mitzvah. But in -- in Eu-Europe they didn’t make no big things.
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   Q: I see. SL: Most of the thing was done in shul and that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: What -- Th-Th-Th-Th-There -- Those -- Those things never bothered me. If it be meant to be, I would have had a Bar Mitzvah, but to show that my -- my -- my -- what they call the -- the -- my destiny. I wasn’t meant for a Bar Mitzvah and didn’t have no Bar Mitzvah.
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: My biggest belief is destiny. That’s why I don’t worry about everything. Whatever is going to be is going to be. I live at present, see? I don’t care -- I know what the past was, I don’t care what the pre -- what the future 1s going to be. Live right now. Because why should I worry bou -- say something’s going to happen? Why do I have to worry what’s going to happen? I even taught my children the same way. Don’t worry how to cross the bridge to wa -- before you get there. A lot of people, they worry, before -- before they get -- b-before something happens. Why should I worry about it? I guess the cant -- the time I spent in the concentration camp taught me that, too. Survive at present.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: Mm-hm. So t-tell me -- I -- I wanted to go -- start with -- just ask you a few things about the -- the liberation at Buchenwald. SL: Oh, Pll tell you a story about it --
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   Q: Wa -- Okay. SL: -- my liberation. Hell, you brought it up. I moved in over here two and a half years ago. And last year, a men moved I -- moved in five houses away from me -- I’m in 119, he’s in 129, right? And when he came in -- and we are friendly, I walked over to him, I introduced myself and we started to talk. And he saw my accent, you know. He says, “Where you from?” So I told him, “I’m from Lithuania.” He says, “No, where were you during the war?” I says, “I was in the concentration camps,” right? He says, ““What

  <p id="190">
   Q: What’s his name? SL: What’s his name? RL: I don’t know. SL: Take a look in the book. I'll tell you in a minute. But that’s a coincidence, isn’t it?
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   Q: It’s amazing, yeah. RL: He doesn’t want to talk about it at all. SL: And the thing is, when I was ta -- I was looking -- I was looking out from the -- from the -- from the concentration camp and there was a ba -- there was woods there, uh? And I saw the tank coming down the perimeter of the -- of the -- of the -- of the forests, right? And I saw the ee -- that tank coming into the gate, coming right through the gate. And I meet him after 51 years. Now we had the -- We had the -- I had the interview with Spielberg here and I want him to be in, you know? RL: Sol, what number? SL: 129. And I want him to be in the interview, you know? Of course --

  <p id="192">
   Q: Yeah. SL: You know he’s --

  </p>
  <p id="197">
   Q: He is Jewish? RL: Yeah. SL: Huh? He didn’t want to be with people. Even -- Even when he lived over -- He lived in -- After the war, he didn’t want to be with people. He lived like in a farm, secluded place. Very quiet man. He told me, because he said, first he said his daughter is sick, then he told me why he didn’t want to be in interview. He says, “I couldn’t go through it again.” I says, “Listen, if I could go through it -- when you talk about things like that,” he says, “I can’t talk about what I saw.” But the thing is, you know, when you talk about something, you feel better.

  <p id="198">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: I used -- I also used to be -- I used to talk a little about it, but I didn’t talk about it much, til I open -- had my open heart surgery. It’s like somebody said, “Here, you got another chance in life. Open up and talk about things.” I opened up, I talk about it. My whole personality changed. I mean, I became like a different human being. My wife knew me -- She knew me -- How many years she knew me? RL: A long, long time.
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   Q: Did -- Did you make a conscious decision after the war to not talk about it? SL: No, I guess -- it’s not -- 1t’s not a conscious decision. It’s certain things that when e- |-like, even the -- there’s certain things I blocked out from my mind. I don’t even remember it, okay?

  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: But you just blocked it out. You didn’t want to talk about. Something -- I guess your mind -- your body itself has certain shut off valves and it -- it cuts it off itself. It’s the same thing like a pressure valve. If you -- If you [indecipherable] a valve to release, you would explode. See I -- I use my body as a plumbing system, right? That’s the way I use my body. And if you built a lot of pressure up and you don’t release it, you haven’t got a valve to release it, you going to explode, the same thing as a hot water heater, right? And the same -- that’s the same thing with your body. I use my mouth as a si -- kitchen sink, see? If you put in a lot of garbage, right -- if you watch what you put

  <p id="201">
   Q: Hm. SL: Because when I was young I used to eat a lot of junk, so my arteries closed up.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Hm. So tell me a little bit about -- so after -- after the -- the tanks came in in Buchenwald, what was the treatment like? I know you tal -- you talked it -- about the -- that was very interesting about the -- the food that the Americans prepared was too rich. SL: Oh, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   Q: People got sick. SL: Well, after we were liberated, they came in and the Americans, you know, the -- a lot of people were sick, you know, they were starved. And they came in and th -- and they started to cook. They started to cook pigs with all kind meats. Very greasy food. People the -- their intestines were all dried up, right? And they started to eat like -- I mean, the people are hungry. Now me, like somebody was watching me too, right? And the -- the only thing I was eating is potatoes and bread. I wouldn’t take -- maybe because my religious upbringing, a -- the hahsa, right? And you couldn’t eat no hahsa, and that’s -- that’s -- not -- non-kosher meat, right? May-Maybe cause of my u- upbringing, I was saved about it. But the only thing I ate was bread and potatoes, right? Now, people were getting sick, they were getting dysentery. Te-Tens of thousands of
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: But other than that, what was the -- was the treatment good from the Americans? SL: Oh yeah, very good. Listen, when they came into the camp -- and Buchenwald was one of the best ca -- was one of the best camps I was in, the same thing with Dachau, Dachau was also a good camp. But co-considering, you know, it’s -- the treatment was very good. They treated too good, and weren’t used to it. After abou -- After about a week or so, they took us out from the -- they got all the children together, they took us out from the ca -- from the camps, where the German soldiers used to -- used to bring the barracks there, they had like big buildings, at least, I think four or five story buildings. And they took all the children and they put us into those barracks there and that’s where we stayed. And then they did as -- the f -- the fren -- the French -- French government, the S-Switzerland, Holland, England. This -- They started to take some children, you know, because most of them, they were without parents.
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   Q: So, of that group of 500 children -- SL: 522.
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: 522. How many went to France with you? SL: A couple of hundred went -- went to France. Some went to -- I don’t know how many went to Sweden and some went to England.
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   Q: And where you went in France, were there other children from other camps there also? Or was it just those --
  </p>
  <p id="208">
   Q: Right. SL: Okay? But this -- this -- the organization that took us over is the Ozair, 1f you ever heard of it. It’s a -- It’s a -- It’s a -- It’s a Jewish organization.
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they -- they -- the one that we were in, that was strictly from Buchenwald. That was with Elie Wiesel, well, and --
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: And tell me a li -- What was your life like there, in that place? SL: Oh, it was very nice. Listen, we were running around, I mean we had our freedom. They were trying to teach us a trade. They taught us -- Some people went to sc -- first of all, we went to school to learn a little French. So these the teachers and then some -- said all the ones want to learn, to | -- to -- to learn trades. The life itself was very good. We stayed in the -- one of the places we stayed was in Rothschild’s pi -- one of his palaces there, all right? But the thing 1s, he didn’t give us the palace, he gave us, for this, the stables, the servant quarters, where the horses used to stay in. But still, listen, it was very nice of them, it was very comfortable. We had -- We had plenty to eat. They gave -- They even drink wine, even when you’re children, they give you wine, right? I mean, over there, everybody’s a alcoholic there. And we played games. We have soccer, we used to have sports and -- listen, we had a little chil -- a ga -- a child upbringing a little bit, you know. We weren’t used to things like that.
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   Q: Was there -- Were -- Did some of the children stay in France? Was there some expectation that those children who went to France would stay there? SL: Oh some of them, yeah. Yeah, some of them stayed there.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: There’s quite a few that are still -- still live there. Matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I met -- I met one of the -- two guys actually, that live in France, they settled there. See, but right after the war, I mean, the French government took us, but there was a lot of anti-Semitism there. A lot of them. I mean, right -- you know what the Jews went through, and re -- and when they were -- we -- we came there, they showed it. They didn’t -- still didn’t like the Jews. To this day, they don’t like the Jews. There’s only one place in -- in all France that -- that were friendly to the Jews. If you ever heard of Shablon, I think it was. This -- They -- They -- They saved the whole Jewish population there. They wouldn’t give up one Jew. But the rest are anti-Semitic, they don’t like the Jews, they don’t like the Americans. That’s why we never go back to France. Pll go back faster to Germany, than go to France. People say it’s so beautiful there. I says the - the country is a beautiful country, but the people are rotten. And any place that don’t like me -- don’t like me as a person, as a Jew, they don’t like me as an American, I would never go back and -- and spend a -- a penny there. RL: Sol? SL: Hm? Which one? RL: All these are people from -- from France.

  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And I was -- I saw him in syn -- the synagogue maybe for about 10 - 15 years, right? Now, this guy never talks about it, doesn’t talk about the war at all.

  </p>
  <p id="225">
   Q: Doesn’t that seem a little strange? SL: Even -- Even the same thing, if I mention something ba -- about a camp or something, he says, “Sol, shyer, don’t talk about it. I don’t want to hear about it, okay?”
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Mm-hm. Here? SL: Yeah, my next door neighbor, he -- we -- from Auschwitz -- was in Auschwitz. And he also -- he didn’t want to talk about it.

And they started, they opened up, right? Now, he couldn’t -- he couldn’t believe how much he feels better now. Now, you could talk about -- more about the camps than you could before.

Because the boss saw I was very handy and -- and before he used to have a mechanic come in if a machine broke or thing like that, he -- he used to call a mechanic.

   Q: So you started this job before you went to the army and then you continued? SL: Not all, no. But that was in 1951 I got the job at Shamus, see? Now 1952 they called me in the army, so I told them, “Listen, I have to go in the army,” and that’s it. So from 19 -- October 1952 to September 1954, right? I was in the army. So I got my -- I got inta -- inducted in Camp Kilmo, New Jersey and I took my basic training in Fort Dix, New Jersey, for 16 weeks. And bay -- After bay -- And finished our basic training, we got our orders. Now in that time, the -- the Korean War was on a full -- full blast and more -- I would say 99 percent of the people used to go right to -- to Korea. Me and two other guys just -- we got our orders, went to Germany. As a matter of fact, our -- our Staff Sergeant said, “When I come out from the barracks,” he says, “and when you see,”- I could still see his face right now. He says, “When I s -- When you see me, a big smile on my face when y -- I make your orders, you are all going to Korea.” That’s what he said, right? Big se -- big sergeant. And he came up, and he orders with a big smile on his face. I told you not -- 99 percent of the people went to Korea and my and two other guys, we got our orders going to Germany. After I spent so many years in Germany, I went back to my -- my ho -- my sweet place, where I had such beautiful dreams there, and beautiful memories. And I went to Germany, was in the -- let me see,

   Q: -- over by then. Now, when -- when -- when I talk to people about it, when I talk to people, when I had this hope to be able to work a little bit with the Holocaust Museum, when I hear the stories, it just seems completely unimaginable that it actually took place. It seems -- I can’t comprehend human beings. I can’t comprehend -- and it seems that it happened a long time ago. Can you -- Can you describe for me what -- what it was like to -- to -- those first, say 10 years after the Holocaust and during this time period that you’re talking about, how people perceived what happened, and did people really understand what had taken place?

   Q: Everybody. In America, like say the Americans. SL: A lot -- Let me tell you, a lot of Americans didn’t even realize, they didn’t even know that that -- there was a Holocaust, okay? You talk to a lot of southerners, they didn’t remember the Holocaust. Didn’t know the Holocaust existed. See, the part of Germany that I was in, there was no concentration camps there. Like this, I would have taken and shown it to them. Now -- And the thing 1s, we -- the closest one was Dachau and Dachau -- and we couldn’t get the fellow to go because we were always on alert.

SL: Well, PIl tell you, I blanked it out my mind. I didn’t even think about it. Because if you th -- if things like that continues on your mind, you’re going to go nuts. So certainly- You just blanked it out your mind like it never existed. Forget about it. I don’t know maybe ca -- I wa -- I was built in my -- my system like that, shouldn’t -- I shouldn’t go nuts or crazy. I just blanked it out. I didn’t even think about things like that.

Because, first of all, when I came, there were very few immigrants that came then. And most of my friends were Americans. Even all the girls I used to date were Americans. But, see, the thing 1s, I was -- I was raised and I was very respectful. I was taught to respect -- not like now, you know, everybody fists, you know. I was taught to respect a woman -- a girl.

I just didn’t want to talk about my experience. It’s like I just wanted to put out my mind, just forget about it, like it never existed.
  </p>
  <p id="370">
   Q: But did you think it was important for them to know that it had happened? SL: Is you -- Yeah, I thought it was important, but I just couldn’t open myself up to talk about it, because every time you want to talk about something, 1t brought back very bad memories.
  </p>
  <p id="371">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Yeah. And then your minds just start to wander. So instead of the -- th-the -- like happened, things like that, just ignored it. Cause I in -- I understand why certain people don’t want to talk about it.

  <p id="372">
   Q: Why they don’t want to talk about it?
  </p>
  <p id="373">

  <p id="374">
   Q: Did you -- Did you -- Did anything different happen? I was just thinking about this and there’s just sort of a -- 1t ca-came in my mind. Did anything different happen when your children started to turn 11 or 12, about the same age that you were when you started the experiences? Did you look at them and think about yourself at the same age? SL: No, well, because the kids were spoiled. I -- Things that they wanted, they got, right? I used to think to myself, I says, “By their -- their age, I went through hell.” Even right now, I say the same thing. God forbid if something would happen, those children would never survive.
  </p>
  <p id="375">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Never survive.
  </p>
  <p id="376">

  </p>
  <p id="384">
   Q: I-It’s a funny question and it may -- may be it doesn’t make any sense. It’s just something that I thought that if you had be -- you had taught yourself to be a survivor and to survive not one or two experiences, but many horrible experiences, any one of which is worse than almost anything that almost anybody here goes through. I can’t ee - you know, when I read these stories, when I watch your videotape, you know -- I was in a car accident once. I was in one, really bad, horrible car accident that -- that was one of those accidents that I probably shouldn’t have survived. SL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="385">

  </p>
  <p id="387">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Right? It’s -- I mean, it’s certain things.
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   Q: Now -- And I was very aware of that and I was aware of a gift that I had been given. But even that one accident is not a comparison to anything -- any of the things that you went through. And now -- And th-then I look and I’m reading your story and watching you and I’m saying, “Gee, how -- how can somebody go through all that and then -- and then it stops?” I mean, of course you want it to stop and of course you want and deserve to have a -- a -- a life, and a nice life. But 1s it -- is it difficult, the cau -- because you’ve seen so much?
  </p>
  <p id="389">

  <p id="400">
   Q: Yeah. SL: So -- And also, in a wa -- helped me to s -- see aba -- in 1997, I had open heart surgery.
  </p>
  <p id="401">
   Q: 1987. SL: Huh?
  </p>
  <p id="402">
   Q: 1987? RL: ‘87. SL: ‘87. And my whole personality changed, my whole life changed.
  </p>
  <p id="403">
   Q: Yeah, tell me about that, now was that -- was it instantly or was it kind of gradual, or RL: No, that was -- SL: No, it was instantly, right.
  </p>
  <p id="404">
   Q: Yeah. SL: I was healthy, I used to work like a horse, right?
  </p>
  <p id="405">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Beside -- Besides that cookie business, had a repair business. But my repair business was as a hobby. I used to -- I loved to do it. And what happened, one day we came back from Florida, was president -- president weekend, we went to Florida. And I came back from Florida and there was some snow on the ground and I start to shovel a little of snow and I felt something, right? No pain or nothing, but it’s a certain discomfort, right? And my son says to me, “What’s the matter, Dad, you don’t feel good?” I said, “No, Charles, I’m okay.”’ Maybe it shows on my face. And I went back to shovel snow. And -- ba -- bac -- ba -- couple of days later, I we -- I broke down with my truck, and I was walking to a gas station, and I had to climb up some steps and I got the same -- the same discomfort. I said, “Oh, something’s not right.” It’s the first time I admitted something, see? I never admitted something before. See, before that, I used to - used to smoke. And I used to have problems from the cigarettes because I used to be outside and my foot -- my left foot used to bother me. So I went to orthopedic man and he says, “Oh, you got a dro -- a dropped metatarch -- metatarsal arch, that’s your problem.” So what happened, he taped it up. He says, “That’ll help you.” But instead of helping me, made it worse, because it cut the circulation altogether. So after five weeks, you know, I couldn’t walk on my foot no more. I went back to him, I said, “I don’t know what it 1s.” He says, “Ill send you to a vascular man.” And when I went to a vascular man and when I walked in and looked on my leg -- he told me later, but he didn’t tell me ri -- he thought I was going to have to amputate it. There was no

  <p id="406">
   Q: That’s pretty good. SL: Okay? RL: Yeah, but wha -- SL: And I walked out, that was a Friday night, I says, “Boy, he’s got some nerve to tell me not to stop s -- to stop smoking.” And I walk out and I go into the ki -- to a grocery store and I buy a carton of cigarettes, to spite him, okay? And next morning I got up, and like somebody said -- a -- a voice came into my head, “Sol, who do you fool? The doctor or yourself? The doctor is looking out for your health, right? Not for his health. If you -- If he -- If he wants you with your money, would tell you to come, smoke and come, all right?” I said, “He’s looking out for your health. Sto -- Stop smoking.” And that’s the last time I took a cigarette. I put a carton of cigarettes on my night table and I used to dare myself to take a cigarette. That carton of cigarettes was laying on my night table for a whole year. Never touched a cigarette since.
  </p>
  <p id="407">
   Q: And you had smoked how many years? SL: I -- I haven’t smoked?
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   Q: How long did you smoke up until then?

  <p id="409">
   Q: Mm-hm.

   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="411">

  <p id="412">
   Q: But again, this is something else that’s 1n -- an interesting aspect of your personality SL: Yeah.

  <p id="413">

  </p>
  <p id="418">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="419">
   Q: What’s it called? RL: Tallium stress test, where they inject them with a dye --
  </p>
  <p id="420">
   Q: Oh. SL: Dye. RL: -- and you do your -- it’s stressed exercise --
  </p>
  <p id="421">
   Q: Mm-hm. RL: -- and it’s being monitored and -- and they monitor it, and they see how the blood flows in the heart --
  </p>
  <p id="422">
   Q: Yeah. RL: -- as it wor -- as the hear -- how the heart works and everything. And this is when they can see that something is wrong. SL: So I went to my stress test. I went through the whole stress test, nothing, perfect. Then I went -- say -- said, after the stress test, you go home, you could eat and come back three hours later and we’ll give you the other test. RL: The [indecipherable] SL: So when I -- when I came back, they ga -- I came back three hours later and they gave me the tallium test and they saw something there. Because the dye -- Because the blood doesn’t go through, it lights up, it gets lighter. So he says, “You got something there.” I mean, he didn’t tell me, but they gave the report to the doctor, so when I came to the doctor for the visit, he says, “There’s something there, but we don’t know what it is, okay? But I would suggest you ja -- you go to a angiogram.”
  </p>
  <p id="423">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And this -- the doctor says that, “There’s one man that’s excellent, one of tops.” He says, “If I had to go, I would go to thats gatta, and the hospital’s one of the tops in the country. It’s Saint Francis Hospital in Roslynn, Long Island. And Dr. Ambi 1s one of the top men there.” He says, “Call up and make an appointment.” So I called him up and made an appointment. The earliest appointment he gave me, was in June. RL: When was this? SL: And that was in -- that was in the end of -- of February or beginning of March. I says, “I’m not in a hurry, nothing bothers me.” But one day in May -- in April I think it was, I didn’t feel good. So I called the doctor, he says, “Okay, come down.” I came down and he examined me, he said, “I don’t know, there’s nothing there.” RL: What did Ambi say? SL: He said, “What happened with the -- Didn’t you make an appointment Dr. Ambi?” I says, “Yeah.” He says, “So wh-when do you go -- When did you see him?” I said, “I didn’t see him. The earliest appointment he gave me in June.” He says, “Let me talk to him.” So he calls him up, and he took a -- speaks to Dr. Ambi. He says, “Do me a favor,” he says, “this 1s a very good friend of mine. See if you could see him earlier.” He says, “Okay,” he says, “you know what? Send him down Wednesday, I’Il examine him.” So I came down Wednesday, he examines me, he don’t find nothing there. He says, “I’m going to set you up for a stress test,” I mean, “angiogram.” Tha-That was for

  </p>
  <p id="431">
   Q: Some people -- I -- I -- I -- I think it’s not uncommon for survivors to not want to talk and at some point, they make a decision to talk, when they think maybe it’s time or maybe I better do it, maybe it’s important. I don’t have the sense, when you’re telling me this story, that this was a decision that you made, it just sort of happened. SL: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   Q: Or am I wrong? SL: Listen, I know so many -- I know so many people that -- from the concentration camp. I would say 80 percent and they don’t want talk about it. RL: They don’t want to hear about it.
  </p>
  <p id="433">
   Q: Yeah. SL: Yeah, they don’t want to hear about it. There’s one guy here, he -- he talks about it, okay? He goes to school, he talks a lot about it. There’s another guy, he don’t talk about it at all.

  <p id="434">
   Q: No, but what I’m ap -- f-for -- I -- I want to ask you about that, but what -- but what I’m asking you 1s, after your surgery, was this a decision that you made to talk, or was it just something that happened? SL: Something that happened by itself, no decision.

  <p id="435">
   Q: Yeah.

  <p id="436">
   Q: Di-Did you have a sense that you were close to death? That you ma -- that, you know, that it could have gone the other way and you could have died? SL: Well -- Oh, definitely. Listen, I told my wife -- I mean, when -- I said, “Listen, if something happens to me, I don’t want you to be alone, remarry.” I -- An-And listen, when you go this type of surgery, I -- Y-You didn -- You don’t know if you’re going to come out or not.

   Q: Yeah. SL: That was almost 12 years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: Was a different situation. So -- But it’s like even th-the -- my recovery was excellent, excellent. I mean, the doctors themself couldn’t believe it. That I went in -- I went in to surgery, was three 30 -- a quarter -- a quarter after six, I was out of surgery, right? By seven o’clock my wife was talking to me, [indecipherable] right? The doctors told her, “He doesn’t know what’s going on.” I opened my eyes, I’m shaking my head, okay?

  <p id="442">
   Q: Is that a -- Is that a -- Who a -- Who are they protecting? Are they protecting themselves, or they protecting their families? SL: See, they don’t want to open up. In other words, this -- the thing that -- the thing they -- they know something that hurt them, right?
  </p>
  <p id="443">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they bury it in deep inside --

Listen, there’s s-so many things that I got locked into my head, you know. I don’t want to talk about it. I mean, mo -- most -- most of the things, I talk about, but there’s certain things like your bod -- your mind just blocked it out.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: Yeah. I was thinking about that during, you know, when I watched it. I mean, they asked me to talk to you about other things. SL: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   Q: But if I wanted to talk about those things, I could -- there was a lot of things I could ask you about, but I didn’t -- you know, a few -- a few of them I -- in fact, really, there were a few specific things I wanted to ask you about. One was, she -- she asked you a question in the early part of the interview and you said that -- she asked you if you had been beaten while you were in the ghetto in Kovno, and you said no, you’d seen other people getting beaten, but you were never beaten until you got to Birkenau. SL: Birkenau, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: Now, what -- But she didn’t ask you about the beating. Was that the time you got hit with the shovel, or was -- SL: Yeah, with the shovel.

  <p id="471">
   Q: -- oh, that was -- okay. SL: That’s my arm, here.
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: That’s the one I can’t straighten out.
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   Q: Now, and what happened, the officer was mad at somebody else? SL: Well, we were walking -- we’re working on the railroad, you see, unloading.

  <p id="474">
   Q: Yeah. SL: And a guy [indecipherable] Hungarian Jews, Romanian? RL: Hungarian. SL: Hungarian Jews, yeah. And -- And they all -- They -- They just came into the concentration camp and they weren’t used to things like that, you know.

  </p>
  <p id="475">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: And they used to put in rocks, or whatever, use -- you had to take it here and the other group used to take it back, right?
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   Q: Mm-hm. SL: The shovel in the arm and -- and it broke, I didn’t even know.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: Your arm broke. SL: My arm was broken. But I didn’t feel no pain or nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   Q: Yeah. SL: And all those years, up til 19 -- 1987, right? It used to bother me, but my arm -- I figured maybe it’s arthritis. So it used -- it used to bother me and I never paid attention to it, because my arms just were la -- and then, when I had -- when I had my open heart surgery, I had a problem with my back. So I went to orthopedic man, and after -- and I was getting treatments, I told orthopedic man about my arm. He says, “Let me take a x- ray,” right? He took an x-ray. He said, “Here’s your problem, your arm was broken.” You could still see the break. And it healed, but the thing is, when yo -- after a certain time, it gets arthritic.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: Yeah. SL: And that’s what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   Q: Now there was another story that you -- you also said ri -- in about the same part of the interview, that you were only in one fight in your life, once. And she didn’t ask you about what that fight was. Was that a different story? SL: No, that was something else. The only dif -- When I was a kid, I had the fight.

You don’t pay nothing. The only thing you hope is on capital gain. Now, why is there capital gain?
