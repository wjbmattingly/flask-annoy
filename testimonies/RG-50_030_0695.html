The guy who kills — cut the chickens, the animals.
  </p>
  <p id="194">
   Q: Kosher.
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: Kosher, yeah. Even when we were so close, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="196">

   A: The only good time I had was Christmas.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: And why was that?
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Because when Christmas — when they on the first night Christmas and they saw a Jew, was lucky, you are lucky, because Jesus was a Jew. So then they were, come in, come in, they have cookies, the whole thing. I didn’t know why, but then May 3, 2013 when I grew up, I find out why, because Jesus were a Jew, and according to the thing, they say maybe this is Jesus, you know, a reincarnation of him. So this is very nice to me.
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: It must have been very strange.
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: Hm?
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: It must have been very strange.
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: It was, it was. You were in a country where you were stranger there. You are born there, you are citizen, you went to the army there, but you were still a—a stranger over there. And that’s why most of the Jews, they spoke very bad Polish, because they spoke only Yiddish. Because you don’t like them, they don’t like you. And the whole day, wherever you go in this, you could hear Zyd — I don’t know if you understand, Zyd go to Palestine; Jew, stinkin’ Jew, go to Palestine. This was every day, in school, without the school, wherever you go.

  </p>
  <p id="431">
   A: We supposedly have some of our rel — our relatives, I mean, through marriage relatives. And they’re in there, they won’t let us in. We have a — still a — a horse, and a wagon, and w — and — and we were sl-sleeping outside. Says yeah, okay, in the backyard you can sleep out on the grass, over there. And —
  </p>
  <p id="432">
   Q: But they wouldn’t let you in the house?
  </p>
  <p id="433">
   A: No. They had other people already. That’s what he said. There was jealousy, ma — my father was rich. But anyway, in the morning we got up and want to continue running; a wheel is missing from the whole thing. We know who took it, they took it, yeah, because they had horses too, and cars. And then — May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="434">
   Q: And what good would this wheel do them?
  </p>
  <p id="435">
   A: No, because we thought maybe we could go — but we were on the border almost, almost. So we thought maybe we could go a little deeper away to the — towards Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="436">
   Q: I understand that.
  </p>
  <p id="437">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: What I don’t understand is when they took the wheel away, what value is that wheel to them?
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   A: Well, they were staying over there, they didn’t want to move, they are — they went — because there’s the Russians coming, they are back home. And this happened a couple days later, Russia came in. So they were there. We didn’t have nothing there [indecipherable] in the house, and I don’t know how long we were there, for a while. Then when the Russia tell us, go in there, they call it shal — shal — shalone(ph) — shallon(ph)? Their train, cattle train. And they took us to — t-to Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: Tell me, how did that happen? Why would they do that?
  </p>
  <p id="441">

  <p id="443">
   A: And he needed people.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: Who needed people?
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: Stalin needed people. Is it to work, or is — or is it in — 1n a gold mine, not — a coal mine, so he says, whatever. In the end, he probably think now, we in Russia, we became communists.
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: Did your parents have any views on communism, pre-war?
  </p>
  <p id="447">

I mean, you — first of all it’s — it’s interes — well, it’s — it’s perplexing to me to hear of some — of a family that’s Orthodox and religious, that would be inclined to si — to think well of communism.

  </p>
  <p id="972">
   A: You know, in beginning, I look a-at all of them like they’re all killers. When you live a while with them, you see that it’s not them, it-it’s the law. And they are — this 1s the way they were — the book says, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="973">
   Q: Well, tell me then, if you married somebody who was German, clearly it was someba — thing that you didn’t — you know, it wasn’t — it didn’t prevent you from becoming close, and having a family, and the — in the most intimate way possible. May 3, 2013

  </p>
  <p id="982">
   A: See, I—I didn’t grow up in Germany, right? But Polish people, the Jews, if they want to go to medical school, or law, they couldn’t get in. Poland wouldn’t — they wouldn’t accept Jew, the best grades. Over there they always did accept Jews.

  </p>
  <p id="987">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="988">
   A: Yeah. You can’t became nothing here, because you are Jewish. Over there they never — they’Il always help you. And a lot of rich people were Jewish over there.

  </p>
  <p id="992">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="993">
   Q: Yeah. Is there anything you’d want to add to what we have been saying?
  </p>
  <p id="994">
   A: I—I think — I-I son — I son — I said what I want to know. This is the way it is. It was normal to us to be cold, an-and [indecipherable]

   Q: That was normal, yeah. It was acceptable.
  </p>
  <p id="996">

  <p id="1002">
   A: You didn’t. You are there and that’s it, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1003">
   Q: And it was acceptable to their society to say it. That’s what I meant to say.
  </p>
  <p id="1004">
   A: That’s what I’m saying 1s that before Hitler came, most of the doctors and lawyers came from Germany, because they could study there, they ta — took you in, you know. And th-then, you came back to Poland, you could then open an office. But you never came — became a judge.
  </p>
  <p id="1005">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1006">
   A: Only a lawyer. No, we have — we have a joke about that. A guy tried — he was a Jew, came back from Germany as a lawyer, he’s doing very well. He wants to become a judge. He tries, once, twice, three — no. So finally sa — the priest called him in. He says to him, li-listen, you want to become a judge? Convert. He says, me convert? I don’t want to convert. Li then — he says, think about it. Okay. He thi — cames back the next day to the priest, okay, I’Il convert. So he converts, and every Friday [indecipherable] open, he’s sitting in a restaurant, eating a chicken. Friday [indecipherable] the priest pass by, and says to him, son, you know, you’re eating meat, today you can’t eat meat. He says no, it’s not meat, it’s a fish. The May 3, 2013 priest looked again, he says no, it’s — it’s a chicken. He says, no, it’s meat. He looked again, he says to the priest, Father, I did the same thing what you did. I took some water, I says, you were a chicken, you are a fish, you were a chicken, you are a fish. Now it is became a fish.
  </p>
  <p id="1007">
   Q: Yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="1022">

  </p>
  <p id="1035">
   Q: Okay. What would you want young people today to understand about your experience in Poland before the war, your experiences in Russia, and the things you learned after the war. Those are three distinct parts, but what would you want them to understand about each of those segments of your life?
  </p>
  <p id="1036">
   A: I don’t think they’ Il ever understand, thank God, thank God. You grow up here, you just — sometimes I don’t believe that I could go o — through the whole thing, yeah. Let — let me take the army. We have no beds over there. Straw on a piece of wood. And no underwear, in the same uniform you were sleeping and eating. When an inspection from the United States came, before he came there, everybody get a piece of white linen, put it over here, make believe we have a shirt. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1037">

   A: No, Russian prisoners.
  </p>
  <p id="1045">
   Q: You were watching Russian prisoners?
  </p>
  <p id="1046">
   A: Yeah, it was not prisoners, it was — it was a torture. What it was is, I had 16 years old and 90 years old, all kind. This is Stalin had thing to scare people to talk. You couldn’t talk about Stalin bad thing. So to scare you, almost every month, or every week sometimes, somebody has to disappear from your neighborhood. So this 1s you keep your mouth shut. The way they did it, never did — never arrest you at your house, or never at work. On the way home from work, usually the girls [indecipherable] girls start to talk to you, or they just have to ask you something, in the police station. You never came back. Used to [indecipherable] I met them over there, you know, I was a good guy, because I — I was part of them, almost, but they didn’t know it. So they told me, one — a couple over there, from the wedding, they took him, for no reason [indecipherable] the people, just to scare. And then —
  </p>
  <p id="1047">
   Q: So they were just normal people?
  </p>
  <p id="1048">

If you go to court over there at the time, they had — they had lawyers. The lawyers can’t do nothing. If you tri — the lawyer will try to show you are innocent, so you are against the government. So you'll be punished. So you just staying there like a — like mummy, and that’s it. And listen. And this is the way —
  </p>
  <p id="1051">
   Q: Well, I understand what you mean by saying it would be good if they never have to understand it — that is young people. Do you think that then — I mean, it’s — it’s one thing when you have someone who’s gone through an experience, there’s a cost in remembering, there’s a price to remember. Are you saying it’s better that people are never really informed of these things?
  </p>
  <p id="1052">
   A: Not informed, yes. But — but they wouldn’t understand you, because I don’t believe it any more. You had to go through, you know, because it’s a — impossible
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   A: — to — to — to accept, not to be a human being where you are one. Treat you like a — you are — yeah — o-or in the army — not in the army himself, in the toilets. There was a big hole with a piece of wood. And male or female, we all sitting together. Come on. May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   A: So you — you — you are used to almost nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   Q: It’s very hard for people who have not been reduced to almost nothing, to know what it’s like. And I suspect it’s very hard to have words to put to that experience.
  </p>
  <p id="1058">
   A: We were in the army, I told you [indecipherable] there, watching those prisoners. It was winter. For three months we didn’t had nothing to eat. No — nobody cared to get — get to us, so we finally yu — saw a field where the farmers took off their cabbage. Was no cabbage there, the roots. We dig it out the roots, nothing wash it [indecipherable] shanell(ph), they call shanell(ph) the uniform [indecipherable] this is the soldier.
  </p>
  <p id="1059">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1060">
   A: [indecipherable] they just couldn’t understand, they thought that somebody make up story. Or — or like my brother [indecipherable] you know, the showers. Forget about shower [indecipherable] we had a — not a hole, a piece of stone over there, with a couple blankets hanging, they’re outside a fire. You put snow, and from the snow we get steam. And this was our shower. You didn’t get sick, you went without shoes, without the winter. This were your shower. Could you believe it? No.

  <p id="1061">
   Q: No. May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   A: [indecipherable] remember?
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   Q: What was it like when you live in the United States? Does it — did it ever feel lonely that there wasn’t anybody you could talk about these things to? Or that — who’d understand. Not that you’d need to talk about it, but who could understand it.
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   A: Only the foreigner, who went through more or less the same thing, will understand, yeah. Not from the other side. This was paradise. It was — here, when we came, we just couldn’t believe it, we had the — we couldn’t believe it, we are talking with a nice human being, you know. Thank God. Food all over. You don’t have to stay in line, like you used to.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   A: You used to stay in lines for hours, and then they haven’t got any more. Like I — I —I love watermelons. I says, for one week or two weeks I was living only on watermelons. I had no money, I had nothing to buy [indecipherable] the watermelons were growing over there, just growing, you know, wild. And this the only food what I ate.
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   Q: Do you think — are there — well, here’s a — a question that’s a little provocative. Do you think that there are people who endured the Holocaust, who were never close to Russia at all, who don’t understand what you went through? May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="1068">
   A: I’m sure there are plenty of it. For one reason that I — I-I-I tried to understand, 1s it true? I — I start not to believe what [indecipherable] look at me, and I’m still here, and I have a office, with kid, with children. How could I live? But yeah — I mean, you start to think, you go [indecipherable] details. You went through more than y-you could take, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   Q: Do you have — do you have — sometimes Russian Jews who have emigrated to the United States have felt alienated because people haven’t understood their experiences. There’s — I’m talking in the 70s, in the 80s, and the 90s and so on. Do you think there’s something to that?
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   A: The worst thing 1s, if you can’t share with nobody. It’s always, you know, locked in the — in the — and you ask yourself what has happened [indecipherable] is it true? Some years, are you still alive, you know”? So it’s very hard to tell my kids. Okay, sure [indecipherable]. You can’t. If you don’t go through, you don’t understand, yeah. Same thing with a patient, if you never have pain, oh yeah, don’t worry about it, couple minutes you’ll be finish. For you a couple minutes, but the patient is suffering couple hours.
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   A: Yeah. And same thing [indecipherable] not expected to understand. May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   Q: Did you learn something about yourself as a person, having gone through these things?
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   A: Oh, a lot. I think a lot. I don’t know why, it’s all — 1n all of us. We afraid to throw out the piece of bread. It wa — it’s just, 1t’s too expensive — no, it’s not expensive, it’s — it’s bread, you know, it’s — it’s something like a holy thing, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   A: And then you did a thing for everything. Every step you’re doing here, you can’t believe it, that 1t— you — I used to — I here, free? Do whatever I wanted, you know. A-Alive. And to me at least, start to believe you have a God. You have somebody who does it for you.
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   Q: So it strengthened your belief?
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   A: Yes, yes, yes, more, more.
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   Q: But somebody would say, if He was a God, how did He allow this suffering? I mean, it’s the perennial question.
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   A: Yeah, everybody ask it.
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   Q: Everybody asks this question. How will you answer them?
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   A: You look for a — for wa — answers. You ask, maybe, maybe this guy did something different. Maybe this guy did some — something [indecipherable] to May 3, 2013 somebody, that’s why he has to be punished. Maybe. You don’t know. I never spe — spoke with God. I try. He has no telephone.
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   Q: Or the line is busy.
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   Q: I don’t think the line is busy, but — but you mean, somebody who 1s victimized could be — could be responsible for that? They — they’re guilty of — themselves, of being victimized? Is that what you’re saying?
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   A: Maybe. I mean, if you going back to God now, make believe.
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   A: We don’t know why — you ask the same question. I was — I had the prisoners, I mean, medical thing, it — only killers, maximum, right. But the people there were 90 years old, 70 [indecipherable] never got sick. Why is this [indecipherable] die? That’s the question, who shall I ask?
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   A: The same thing here, it’s hard to tell why.
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   Q: But my question to you is more for those people who want to dismiss that there is a God, and say, if the — why — if there is one, why did he allow such suffering? And you say your faith was strengthened. How do you answer that question for them? May 3, 2013
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   A: Well, to me, what I went through is many miracles. Who else [indecipherable] miracle than God. Somebody higher and stronger than me helped me to go through this. Wha — two slices of bread a day for two years or three years? Working [indecipherable] and — and it’s not that — you have to finish this amount. If you don’t finish, you can work all night. Otherwise you wouldn’t get nothing. It’s not like eight hours [indecipherable] eight hours.
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
