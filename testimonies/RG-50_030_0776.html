[ lived wa — 12 years old, I lived in Garrison Avenue, which is close to Pimlico race track, and I used to sell newspapers in the — in the track during race time. I grew up normal, had friends and I don’t know how — who — where do we go from here.
  </p>
  <p id="6">

  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: Well actually, I had a difficult time. My folks weren’t yet — didn’t make much of a living, so I quit in 11" grade, finished in night school, and went to work. I worked for a— a company that — a jobber. And I would travel to eastern shore, other places, and call on small stores that sell a variety of — of panties, socks, very — I’ve forgotten the group which you would call, but the small retail stores. And I didn’t spend much time with sports or otherwise. Actually, I was always trying to earn a living for my folks. And let’s see —

  <p id="8">
   Q: Were your f— were your fol — what did you folks do?

  <p id="9">
   A: Well, my father was a trouser maker, worked for a shop. But he had a—a-—a-a business of, we would get bags of — of rolls, bagels and so forth, challahs, and we would deliver to homes. And after — after school I would deliver — in fact, we would — we'd deliver rolls and bread in the mornings before I went to school, and then of course he went to the shop and he made trousers.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: Was your — were your parents born in the United States?
  </p>
  <p id="11">

  <p id="13">
   A: And they came to Baltimore, married —
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: So they weren’t — did — they met in Europe, or did they meet in the States? January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A: Th-They met in the States.
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Okay, fair enough.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A: Yeah. In eastern Baltimore there was a — a — a large Jewish population, they were part of it. And that was — they met some — 1n the — in the groups.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: Did you grow up in an observant household?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: Well, we — we — we started kosher, not strictly. But we — we appeared to — the — we — we belonged to synagogue, and we never had seafood, or — or — or non-kosher food, but as time went along — went on, we — we sort of dropped kosher and — and — although we — we’d — she — my folks would — would deal with kosher markets.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: But I wasn’t — I’ve never eaten treyf, I still don’t. And I met my wife in Washington — well — well in — let me — let me get — backtrack. As I said, I grew up, I have a— I had two brothers. I was the oldest. My middle brother is about seven years younger than me, and my younger brother was about 13. He died in the — well, let’s s — let’s say, after I— wh-while I was in the service, my folks moved from Baltimore to Washington. They took over a cleaning store in south Washington. So when I returned from the service, I moved, of course th — moved to Washington, and after a few years, I met my wife, and we got married and had th — January 13, 2015 we had — we have two sons, Philip and Arthur. And they eventually married and had families. And they live in Florida, both families.
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: Let’s go back to your childhood for just a moment, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: You said you sort of fell away from kosher slowly — or at least not strictly observant.
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: Well, as I remember — let me see, I’m — I’m trying to remember now whether my folks died here — yi — well, of course they died — died in the Washington area. I — I would say, not strictly kosher. Well, the — I didn’t — I didn’t — I don’t remember — well, I’ve never eaten treyf food.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: So-
  </p>
  <p id="28">

  </p>
  <p id="29">

  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: — I’m just wondering, growing up in Baltimore —
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: — in eastern Baltimore, and this, was it simply a — a conscientious decision on the part of your family and your family alone, or did you feel certain pressures from assimilation? Did you feel anything — January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: No — as far as food?
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: No, not really.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: I would say they stayed kosher throughout.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: So I guess it wasn’t til I came to Washington, that when I married, I — I wasn’t strictly kosher.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Sure. There are — I’m — I don’t recall whether or not we covered it, but please state to your date of birth.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: November 18, 1921.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Thank you. Okay, so just overall, how would you describe your childhood? Did you enjoy it? Did you — did you like your childhood? Was it rough and tumble and urban, or was it more, perhaps sheltered and quiet? Or how would you — overall, how would you describe your childhood?
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: Normal. I had friends, and through school I — I had none non-Jewish friends. In — when I was around 10 years old, we licked — lived in a mixed area, and I recall that we had — we had ballgames between Jews and Gentiles.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Okay. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: And I didn’t really socialize with non-Jews, and I guess I grew up in a normal — normal way. As I said though, but I was always helping my — my parent earn a living, and so I got through. Nothing — nothing outstanding, it’s just a normal — a normal life.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: I’m curious about the ballgames. How did they end up? Did — did — did — did the Jews and the Gentiles sort of split the wins and the losses more or less evenly, or di — were you the dominant team, or —
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Well, I was very good, whether it was baseball or football. And I guess it was a mixture. Sometimes we won, sometimes we lost.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Okay. So, you’re working as a jobber, distributing undergarments, socks, things of that nature —
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: — to various shops, more or less in the Washington, D.C. area, or did you have a large geographic area that you were responsible for?
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: This is when I was living in south Baltimore. We had some customers in — in the area, the north — northwest Baltimore, but I recall I would go to the eastern shore, and there were stores in eastern Maryland. And where else? What — what’s another large — I— I would have customers in different parts of — of eastern shore.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Did you travel by car, or ca — January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Yeah, I had a car. And I had big suitcases, and I would take orders with whatever items they — they wanted.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: How old were you at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: I guess around 16.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: 17.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: And how long did you carry on that job?
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Until I went into the army.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Tell me about that. When — were you conscripted, were you —
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: I—I was drafted in November of 1942.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: When I became 21.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: Fair enough. Now, the war itself, when —
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: I-
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: — did you first become a-aware? Were you — when did you first become aware, if at all, that this — Jews in Germany and throughout Europe were specifically being targeted for harassment and violence? Did you know before going in the service, or did you know ab — when did that — exactly did that happen?
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: I don’t recall. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: I don’t —
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Let’s go back to conscription.
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: Were you given the option of the European or Pacific theater?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Well, let’s — first of all, I was drafted into elev — a — a new organization called 11" armored division. And we originated in Louisiana. I was in the 42™ tank battalion of the 11" armored division, and I trained as a tanker. And because of my written tests that I took, plus the — the training I got, I was — I —I—I cou —I could have become a — an officer. At that time I have ant-anti-Semitism in the service, specifically in — in the area that I was training as a tanker. And I had some anti- Semitinism(ph) involved, and because of that, I had an opportunity to go to headquarters of 42" tank battalion, and so that’s what I did. And I became assistant to the adjutant there. And then, of course, we went overseas, and I went on — and as I was — I was — I was transferred to the — the headquarters as a clerk typist, and so that was my title, although I didn’t — when we went overseas, I didn’t do any typing or anything. I w —I was the assistant to the adjutant and of course the battalion commander gave instructions — wanted instructions to the — the adjutant. And of course, my being the noncom, I did the — whatever had to be done. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: Let’s go back to the — the na — the anti-Semitism that you experienced inside the army.
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: Talk about that, the nature of it. How did you feel it, how were you exposed to it?
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: Well, what happened was, a — a incident, for example, during the growing of th — of the — of the division, of the company, the battalions. People were transferring in and out, and there was a — a Jewish soldier, Weinberg(ph), that transferred out, and the — several of — of the soldiers said good, we got rid of another Jew. At that point I said, I’m Jewish. They couldn’t understand. I didn’t look Jewish, my name wasn’t Jewish. And I says, well, you didn’t — you don’t see the horns coming out? At any rate, I— I had a different feeling with — with these soldiers, who were part of my tank — tank company. And so I didn’t feel comfortable going to officer training, coming back, and dealing with — with anti-Semites in my outfit, fighting the Germans. So, that was — that was why I transferred to the company. And course we didn’t have any — I didn’t have to deal with any anti-Semitism while in the battalion headquarters. So that was — that was the experience I had.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: Okay. Do you recall when and how you received your call-up notice? Where were you, how did you receive it? January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: I was in Baltimore on my 21“ birthday. As I said, I was working for this jobber, and I got notice that I — I’m in — I’m drafted into the army.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: How did you feel about that?
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: I took it in stride. I knew I had to go, and so I had —
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: Where did you first go to training? Where was your initial training?
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: In Louisiana.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: What was it like?
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: Camp Polk.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: What was it like?
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Well, course it’s all new. As I said, I was in a tank battalion and I was in the — I was in C company, if I recall. And trained with others, learning all about tanks, and the armaments, and I was an expert with — with a submachine gun. Got a medal there, and I learned the 75 millimeter cannon. And I also trained, or learned the .45 pistol. And I learned my — I learned the armaments very well.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Was it difficult?
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: No, it’s — it’s practice, a lot of time.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: So wa-was it a physical challenge, a mental challenge, or —
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Well, it’s both physical and mental.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: Sure. But you did well. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Okay. Certainly well enough to be solicited for officer training.
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: So.
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: But I turned that down, as I said.
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: Cause I didn’t feel comfortable if I came back as an officer. Although I recall there was a Jewish officer that was in one of the companies, and I don’t recall many Jewish soldiers after that.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: How did you cross over to Europe, by boat?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: We went — yes.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: When and where did you leave?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Well, let’s see if ... ah, we went over in December of 1944.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: And that was by ship?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: By boat, yes, by ship.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: And what harbor did you leave, do you remember?
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: Well, we went to England.
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: We landed in England. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: Did you stay in England for any length of time?
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: Yeah, we stayed in England for quite a time.
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: What were you doing there, training and —
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: We were training, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: What did you think of the English?
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: Thad no problems with them. If I recall, I even — I even dated a — a Jewish girl, and invited to — invited to the home, and — but that wasn’t anything more. And then, of course, we went over to France. Let’s see. On December 16, 1944, the Germans lonc — lanced a — a counterattack 50 mile radius in the Ardennes. And let’s see — okay, and then when — wh-when we went into France, our first assignment was to guard the — hold the section of the Moose River, where the German attack was expected, but on the t — the ti December 26, the fourth armored broke through the German lines, and we leave Bastogne, where the 101“ airborne had been — had surrendered, and — and so the evening of December 31“, ar — our division went to — had a 250 mile, or 150 mile march to — to Bastogne, where we were involved with the — the — the ban — Bastogne — what was it called? The — the — let’s see, where we became part of General Patton’s Third Army, and we were in the combat command A, and we went to — we — we went to Rechrival, Belgium. That was our first area, and it snowed very heavy. And a patrol discovered over 101 infantry bodies dead. January 13, 2015 They brought back an SS officer to our headquarters, and — and understanding Yiddish, I attempted to interrogate him, but I wasn’t too successful with the German, so they brought over interpreters from headquarters that took over, and — and — and interviewed — inter — interrogated him. I noticed the captain of D company was angered with the discovery of the American dead bodies, and he took some prisoners, lined them a — on the wall, and killed them. And I recall that I—I had to take the bodies and put them in — in bags.
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   Q: Did — 1— what was upsetting to command and staff about the American bodies? Was it the nature? Did they appear to have been executed, or —
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   A: What?
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: When you said that you found de — the — the-the bodies, the American bodies.
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: And that upset people.
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Wi — was it — did they die as the result of an — of a — of a combat engagement, or did they appear to have been captured and then executed?
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: That’s wa — wa — they — they captured and executed.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Okay, so this is what —
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: Yes. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: — got everyone —
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: Very upset.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Correct.
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: Including yourself.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: Right. So you saw both the Americans, and then the subsequent round-up of the Germans as well.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: Oh, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: Yes. Of course, our line companies did the — you know, captured the Germans and so forth. I was in headquarters —
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: — and so I wasn’t directly — although — although once — once we captured the — the soldiers is — I was aware of what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: Yeah. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: Did you identify those parti — was it thought that those particular German soldiers who were captured were the ones who were responsible for the execution of the Americans?
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: I don’t —I—I don’t think I felt that way. I —I didn’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: I didn’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: But they were there.
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: And you were angry.
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   Q: Okay. Do you real — hang on just for a moment, before we press on.
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   Q: Do you recall your very first engagement with the enemy?
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   A: Personally?
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: I suppose it was when — when we captured a officer, and th — and the — the — my battalion commander asked me to interrogate the — he knew I was — he knew I was Jewish, and he thought maybe I had a — a —I was very versed in speaking German, January 13, 2015 which I wasn’t. So, I— I—I can’t tell you how I felt at the time. I think things lead up to what happens, and you take it as a matter of stride, I — I ge — I think.
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: Would you say retrospectively, looking back, when you’re there in Europe, the war in on proper, you’re part of it.
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: Did you feel that your training up to that point equipped you to deal with war? Did you feel as if you were prepared?
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: Yes. Yes. As — as all the members of our division were.
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   Q: What — did you form an opinion of the enemy? Were they good soldiers, sloppy soldiers, were they —
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: Well, I recall the various things I did when we ha — we set up a camp. I recall that we had some German soldiers that we made KP, and I-I-I was guarding — at one point I was — I was guarding — I —I did a various — various things. But one — at one time I —I was guarding prisoners, I recall telling this German that he wasn’t doing a good job of cleaning the large soup vats, and he tried to — he says, I’m doing the best I can. And — and that ended that conversation. But I — I didn’t really have any direct contact, as such, with — with — with the German soldiers, other than, January 13, 2015 as I said, at one time I was there. O-Other times I would — I would go into a burnt out tank, and scrape the carcass from the inside, put it in a bag, cause we didn’t want to leave any s-soldiers behind, so —
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   Q: So these were Americans that you had to extract?
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   A: These are — th-these are American, yeah. One of the tanks of — of one of our companies. So —
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   Q: That had to have been extraordinarily traumatic.
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   A: Yes. Yeah. Everything there was — it’s a — but we took things in stride. Soldiers did their job. We — we — we did well, and after — after we left bast — Bastogne, we — we traveled south, and went through Luxembourg, and then Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: Were you engaging the enemy as you’re going along?
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: Oh yes, of course. We’re all fighting, as 1— as 1— as — as I remember, the main force of Germans were defeated in the Bastogne area, and of course there’s still plenty of fighting going on, and we ge — our — our division fought and engaged the enemies as we went down. And then when we got down to — near Austria, as a — as I told you, General Patton was the Third Army commander, and — and instructions were that we weren’t supposed to go into Austria. But Patton didn’t like — didn’t — didn’t like that, and so we went into austr — Austria also. And that’s where — okay, and as I said, the Russians were supposed to take over the — Austria, and — and January 13, 2015 Patton didn’t like the — the Russians either. And so li — going down, one of our companies, one of the companies was making — was doing reconnaissance, and on the road — on a certain road, a German Jeep with the German pa — the commander of — of — of the — of — of the camp, was coming towards them, a — with a white flag, and they surrendered. And it turns out he was telling them of the — of the — of Mauthausen, that 1-it was — it was five miles back. And the reason they — they wanted — they — they gave up to us, is they didn’t want the Russians, because the Russians would — would — would just kill them. And so that was how we learned of — of the concentration camp. The next morning, I went with the battalion commander and the adjutant into the camp. That was my first seeing it. And of course, what I observed was piles of shoes, piles of other things. And course, lot of dead bodies. And then I went into the — into the camp, and I went into a particular — wait a minute, I’m — I’m losing words. But I went in and I spoke with some of the survivors. And I asked, is there anything that —
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: Now, hang on just for a moment —
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: You spoke with some of the survivors because you spoke Yiddish —
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: Yes
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   Q: — you were speaking in Yiddish — January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: — not — not — not English, correct?
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   A: Yeah, English, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Okay, so tell me about your conversations with them.
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   A: And so, I said, is there anything I can do. And I recall several coming to me and saying, could you write a letter to my relative in Chicago, if I remember that — that was — that particular situation. And so I took the information, and I did write a letter to I—I don’t recall having an-any copies, so I — I don’t know, bu-but this is my memory, that I wrote a letter and told of that — that this person was safe. And so that stood out in my mind.
  </p>
  <p id="178">
   Q: What did you think as you were approaching the camp? Before you entered the camp proper, did you know what its purpose was?
  </p>
  <p id="179">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: Did you —
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: So as you’re approaching it, what do you see?
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: Well, I saw — what — what happened was, the German — there was a big quarry, and the Germans got cement out of there. And what they — they used, they set up this — th-this camp, with all the captured Jews that — that had to work in — in the January 13, 2015 quarries. And that is — that is how the camp came about. And the — the prisoners worked in the quarries, getting the cement or wha — wi — wi — the — w-with — wi — which would be the cement that they would be making. So what was my first — I-I — this has been a long time, so I — I really — I really can’t remember how I felt in — in seeing it.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: Were there still Germans — and then ba — by that I mean soldiers, inside the camp, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: Well, what we did, wa — we — we — tho — our — our line companies went in, and of course, yes, there were Germans in there, and they all surrendered, of course. And of course our — our company — companies took them out, and we eventually took them back to headquarters. But as I said, I was in the headquarters of the battalion, and I didn’t physically get involved with — with the soldiers there. We — we had our other — you know, others that were doing it.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Once you and the battalion were inside the camp proper, what did you have to do? Did you have to start giving medical attention, did you start distributing food?
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: Oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course. We have a — a medical battalion with us, and so they went in and did what they had to do, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: And did you feed the prisoners, or was that not in your — did you — did you give them food, did you give the prisoners food, or — January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: I-I—I can’t tell you, but the — th-the company — the soldiers in the — in the various companies did what you had to do. So I didn’t — I personally wasn’t involved with that.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: Okay. But you understood, if no — if for no other reason than language, that a very large number of them were Jewish? The prisoners.
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: Y-Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: Did you — do you recall how you felt about that?
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: Well, I was angry learning of what’s happened, but I — I can’t — I can’t tell you my feelings at the time. It’s —
  </p>
  <p id="194">
   Q: You said in your written testimony —
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: — that at a certain point, as you are advancing through the camp, you came to the crematoria.
  </p>
  <p id="197">
   A: Oh, yes, yes. Here’s a picture of — of the oven.
  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: Now, this is the one that you saw.
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: And as I said, when my father had this bread route, and — and — and breads and challahs and so forth, I used to go to the bakery and they had ovens. That’s where January 13, 2015 they made the challahs and so forth. And when I saw this, it 1t — it made it — it brought me back to mind of the ovens in — in the bakery. And so —
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Did you understand when you saw that, what it was used for, and why it was being used?
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Oh yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: Was it physical obvious?
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: I—I learned — I learned as we went in what was — what was happening, and what they — what did — the Germans had done.
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: And was it the prisoners who you we — that were telling you this information?
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: I don’t recall.
  </p>
  <p id="208">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: I don’t recall.
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: Do you recall how long you spent inside the camp itself?
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   A: I was there maybe just several hours.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: As I said, at the time, we were still fighting in — in — 1n — where was that? In — in — in Austria. Anyway, no, we — we had to leave. But we left behind soldiers that would be doing what they had to do, clean-up and so forth.
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: Mm. But you were still in pursuit of the enemy, so had to move out. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: Oh yeah, we were fight — we were fighting in — in a town 1n — 1n — in Austria now. What — if — if you want to take these papers —
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: Sure, of course. Thank you. Did that experience, this experience of being in the camp —
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Yes?
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: — after leaving the camp, you had to, as you say, go in pursuit of the enemy —
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: — who was in a full retreat.
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Did it change your understanding of why you were fighting the war? Did it change that at all?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: No, we knew we had to fight the Germans. I did learn of — of what they were doing to the Jews. Of course, I didn’t know at the end of the year — at the end of the — how many Jews were killed, and I wasn’t — I wasn’t happy with — with what I’d learned.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Of course not. As you’re pursing the enemy deeper into Austria, at some point, relatively soon, you get word that the war is over. How and when did that happen?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: While we were still in that town. We stayed there until the — the war was — then we got news of the war ending. January 13, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Do you recall how that news was transmitted? How did you learn that the war was over?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: ’'m sure my adjutant, my commander learned of it, and I don’t know how. I guess word of mouth.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: Were you excited, happy, or relieved to — how would you describe your emotions?
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: My emotions were — I was very happy, but we had already — we felt that we had captured the enemy in — in — in Austria, and just — just biding there until the war ended.
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: How much longer did you spend in Europe after the war was over?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: I don’t recall. I think — I think our division went back — you know, I don’t recall — the last I remember is being in the — in this town in Austria and telling that the war is over, but I don’t remember how we — how I got home. Whether we — we went to England — I don’t know, ma — maybe —
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Sure —
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: — maybe that tells us —
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: It’s quite all right.
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: —I don —I don’t know. January 13, 2015

  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: Very fortunate.
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="248">

She wanted h-he-her daughter to marry — to meet somebody else, who — who had — she had met, but she decided she would like me better. And if I remember — as I said, my — my family wasn’t too wealthy, and they had their own little clique of friends, and if I remember, my mother-in-law wasn’t too happy with my family. That she was — I remember her trying to be a little soci — soc — socially she didn’t feel we were in the same category.
  </p>
  <p id="288">

Which was part of the Kay jewelry operation. And if I recall, we had two or three jewelry stores as part of that — that — and I would go — I would audit, I think that’s where — and of course I — I took the CPS test, and I was not successful.
