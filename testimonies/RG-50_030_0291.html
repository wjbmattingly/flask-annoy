At first I was very strong, in the kitchen you stood by yourself, you arrested, that's it. And little by little the Germans got used to us because most of us knew us a little spoke German. Then they worked the out for a long time in ------ Truck Park. The army trucks that had also not much to eat, I couldn't take towards them. A lot of people used to barter, they shift for a loaf of bread, a watch for something else; that was the real way of life. Until "the little ghetto" was liquidated, complete, and they went over to the big ghetto. And had no place where to live. Then my father found a man, he knew him maybe from six years ago, I don't know, ------------------, And met this man and he gave us a little room, maybe part of the kitchen, but --- intention, no? ------ cause any problem, we had nothing what to barter or to sell what. My father told us "We can't go on like that." My sister worked, and I worked, my father worked all that time, and the mother was home preparing the cooking. Horse meat! (he laughs) Then for some reason my father knew a man before the War he did him a big favor, he was one the head for the work agency, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: In the ghetto.
  </p>
  <p id="81">

And then sometimes some people used to get vodka, and vodka 1s a big item in wartime. A I used to get from gentiles used to bring us bread, potatoes, beets. For long time ------ the main dish was potatoes. And used to make from bread, soup, no? From the bread: used to cook it and cook it until become like a soup. Then later on they gave us the horsemeat.

And she worked over there and the ghetto came in a man with a lot of leather, and they start to make ladies' pocketbooks. Then she used to go out every day with the pocketbooks which ----------- and sell it, and my father told not to carry too much. And she used to bring bread, a little butter, and some money, because in the ghetto everything suddenly became some little source, (he laughs) even butter -- potatoes for beets, potatoes for butter, potatoes for meat. No pets.

   A: And then we used to go in the countryside to load potatoes for the ----- and the ghetto to enter the main involving the park, no? I used always to go the sack with me in case they had something, always. I used to go to a town about 50 miles from Kovno, on the farm, and then I used to get everything -- apples from them -- for nothing because I used to speak well Lithuanian and that and that. Then I used to put in, too, three or four people used to put in three or four sacks of potatoes, big ones, and I used to try to talk to the driver to bring it at night after nine o'clock to the other side. Then used to start the clock I used to bring in one sack of potatoes and on the ground they gave me another one. Then my father used to wait for me sometimes and used to take it when he go'd home.

  </p>
  <p id="179">
   Q: OK. Let's go back a little bit to the ghetto. Were there efforts to hide and to resist the ghetto when the ghetto was in occupation? Where there people in the ghetto who were trying to go underground and get out of there or --
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   A: A lot. Look: some had ghetto friends who told them they were hiding especially a lot of young good-looking ladies had no problem that were in hiding, a lot went in the woods, became partisans.
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   Q: I was asking if there was an underground movement of people trying to get away.
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   A: Was underground to go to the woods partisans, to make sabotage to the German army. That was done little by little. A lots of people have been caught when they used to go out from the ghetto, a lot went to the woods, a lots of people once went to a little town, [name of town], was 40 in one place, and they used to go at night time, no? by the peasants, knock on the door, had a gun also, told them, "Give us food, if not we'll burn your house next time." And --------------had the straw and paper and -- then they made a big mistake. One day in the woods they found a Russian soldier was hiding out and they stabbed him. They needed food to cook. Then he told them you know the way how to go and he will go for the salt. And they cut him and he gave up everything. ------- there, how much there, and they came at night and they killed all of them.

  <p id="186">
   A: That started after I was sent to Estonia, 1t was later on I became the underground. In the ghetto, I don't know how far you remember that, was the right wing from Jewish Zionist and the left wing in the ghetto all came together, they worked together.
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   Q: What sorts of things did they do in working together?
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   A: -------- good people, they don't trusted everybody, connections with the woods, with the people, how to go, where to go, where to pick them up. Was a big production.

   Q: Was the Jewish committee and the Jewish police -------------------------?
  </p>

   A: Some did, some no. After this I went to Estonia that I know, after the Gestopo told all the Jewish policemen, arrested them and took to the fort, and told every second one should step out in front, no? one they sent back to the ghetto, the other one they shot out. Because they been afraid, not to leave the witnesses. Some of them cooperated with the Germans. Some, in the last year what I know, they used to make hiding places in the houses, like next to walls. You couldn't, was a master job they had done, they had a steps, no? and in the steps are the hiding, and some policemen gave out. Maybe they arrested him and they told him, "Look: if you don't say they kill you." ------- policeman told, "Kill me, I don't know nothing." But one man whom I admired, and they call him "the prince in the ghetto,", please remember that, he remembered. He was -------- Lieutenant, ------ like West Point but he became a private citizen, was a young guy, maybe 23 and 24, a prince. And they arrested him if he knows where people are hiding, and he knew and no told them. They killed him, they beat him --------. | know a lady, her son he goes out, he was four or five years, I don't know how, the kid start to took something, they arrested him. Then they came and arrest his mother. And that lady knows a year for me, I'm sure they ask her if she knows about more children, and she knew, don't give up nothing. But ----------, you know, that most of them are dead-------.

  <p id="191">
   A: Do you know of the different ways that the police helped the Underground or --------- maybe helped the Underground?
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   A: Oh yes. -----------. Sometimes they go out from the ghetto, they knew how to pull them out, no? Because they be in good condition, so the Germans were staying by the ghetto.

But the Germans------------------------------------------------, Then you have to do it, they they shoot you right away or they arrest you ----------------------------------------.

  <p id="202">
   A: They couldn't do nothing, all the people they couldn't do nothing. ---------------------------------

  <p id="203">
