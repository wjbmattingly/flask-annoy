   A: The reason I was born in Savannah, Georgia was that there was a— a pawn shop in Savannah that was operated by a — a — an elderly Jewish man, and he wanted to have somebody take over for him in the — you know, the daily duties. So he sent word out to New York that he would be prepared to move a Jewish couple down to Savannah and get them lodging, if the — the man in the family would take over the running of the pawn shop. And he interviewed my father, and he felt my father was qualified, and my father had recently been married to my mother, who came over from Lithuania to — I think she was encouraged to come over to meet my father, but I wasn’t there, so I don’t know anything about that. Anyway, they did get married and go — and went down to Savannah, and s-so that’s where I was born, and my three younger siblings were born there, too. Eventually the pawn shop turned into a large department store, and my father became the manager of the department store.

   Q: Ah, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="15">

  <p id="17">
   A: Yes, I had three siblings, and I was the oldest, and sadly I’ve outlived them all.

   Q: Oh dear.

   A: It’s — some of them died fairly young. Two of them actually contracted illnesses in Lithuania during the very severe winters that we experienced there. One of them had spinal meningitis, which —

  <p id="21">
   A: — did not affect his life, other than it was a great shock to us to find out that —he was just a little baby — well, not a baby, but he was about two years old, or so, and — or three. And after he — he recovered from the spinal meningitis, we discovered that he could no longer hear anything. So he became a deaf mute. But he — he —

   Q: — it’s just to get a sense of —
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Yeah,, I wish I knew all these things, but since our family was pretty much broken up with all the trips back and forth, and my father losing his job as — as a consequence of these interruptions in our lives, we didn’t have family affairs like birthday parties, and — and celebrations. I mean, it was just get what you could get out of life, you know, so that’s why I don’t — I really don’t — I— I never put much store in anyone remembering my birthday, or — or me remembering theirs. In any case, he did — he did grow up as a deaf mute, and worked, and had a family, and had a — a reasonably successful life.

   A: Yeah, because during the tsarist regime, everyone was fleeing, I d — from what I’ve heard, and I — I have no reason to know whether it’s true or not. They mainly feared being in the tsarist military, and being sent to fight in Japan, or some — you know, strange place in the world.

   A: Well, there was a local paper — papers, but I — I don’t remember the — the names of the papers. My only interest in those papers were the Sunday funnies, and the daily funnies as well. My brother Harry and I were crazy about the cartoons, because we were bo-both had art talent. And part of the art talent we had came from copying the cartoons from the newspaper strips, which were taught to us by our father.

   A: Well, he — he was — he was, unfortunately, a beaten man. And that took a lot out of him. Took a lot of the fun out of him. And the reason he was beaten 1s that, because of his frustration at not being able to keep his family in America, my mother was constantly taking us to Lithuania, he lost his job because of that. He — the first time we went to Lithuania, h-he — he ga — he just took off from his job as manager of a department store, and spent months and months trying to get us to come back. And when he returned, of course the Great Depression struck, I think that was 1929, and his job was eliminated.

   Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about — now let’s get to — to the part where — where you — you leave. I mean, what are the conditions of the first time that you leave, how did it happen? It sounds like from what you’ve told me so far, the picture that’s been painted, it kind of comes out of the blue. Why would she want to leave?
  </p>
  <p id="260">
   Q: The reason my mother wanted to leave, as far as I can understand it, was really very simple one. She had a father in Zarasai. She had a sister, Liefa(ph) in Zarasai, who was married to Moysai(ph) and — and they had a son, Danke(ph), Daniel, and — and she had friends that she had left behind. So she convinced my father that she would just like to go for a visit. Now of course, I wasn’t old enough to know — to be privy to their conversation, did she say to him, I want to go for a month, or two weeks. There must have been some kind of time limit discussed. Well, all I know is, the time was dragged on and on and on.
  </p>
  <p id="261">
   Q: When did you leave, by the way, what year was it, do you know?

Well, I couldn’t wait to get out of there, and then we wound up at some Muma’s(ph) place, an aunt. And — and that also was kind of crazy, because these were not mansions. They were lit — tiny little apartments in — in poor neighborhoods, and all the people squeezed into one big room, you know.

So — but I knew all the areas in — in Zarasai that were — that had Jewish homes mixed in with non-Jewish homes, and no one was likely to attack me, because they knew that I would run to the Jewish home, and then it would be a whole big hullaballoo between grownups.

  </p>
  <p id="407">
   Q: When — when you came to Zarasai, what was, if there is one thing, or two things, that struck you as the strangest things you’d ever seen? Because you’d come from a different world. You’d come from — I mean, Savannah 1s certainly different than New York City, but that’s the world of the United States, and you come to this one, and you’ve mentioned that it’s like being in pre-history, but what was the strangest thing that you saw?
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of automobiles. There was not a single automobile. In fact, when one would be coming in from Kovno, that we had heard about, all the kids would gather to run after the car. And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust, because it was such an unusual smell. And that struck me. The other thing was that you could find food on trees everywhere. All you had to do was walk in a certain area where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and get an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries. We used to go after those things.

   Q: Mm-hm. And — and what about — you said your grandfather was sort of like an advokat(ph), maybe without formal training, but nevertheless, that. What was — what would he do? What was he —
  </p>
  <p id="414">
   A: He — he interceded on behalf of Jewish people who needed to go to court about S-some — some matter. It — 1t wasn’t things like divorce, or — or suing a storekeeper. What it was, I think, is these people received a notice that there was a — some kind of violation. Either they left their horse out in the street, or who knows what? And my grandfather — now, I never heard him speak Lithuanian, and I suspect that he really couldn’t speak Lithuanian because they really were refugees from Russia. But he did speak Russian fluently, and he might have learned enough Lithuanian to get by, for all I know, I just never heard him speak it. So he would — a — a Jewish person who had received a notice that he has to come to the court, my grandfather would represent him. And as a large landowner in town, he — he did, he ow — he owned a —a very big house on what would be in New York a sw — an entire square block.

Well, my father ba — at that point, the only way he could survive after losing the thing in the bank, was to apply to the post office for a job, which, he took the test, but because he was a veteran of World War I, they gave him extra points so that he — he was one of the chosen.

  <p id="778">
   A: That is the last time I ever saw my mother. We did get a couple of pieces of mail, and very warm, loving letters pleading with us not to forget her. Very touching.

   A: None that I know of. I have never heard any explanation. The — the counterpoint to what we were talking about, my father’s loyalty, and his dedication to saving his children, the counterpoint to that — to that puzzle is my mother not seeming to care. I mean, you would think that she would have rushed — she would have written letters to my father — she could have communicated, there was no question about it — and saying get me out of here, I want to see my children. Now, the — the only thing I can conclude is that there must have been some kind of mental breakdown, which would be understandable, certainly in the co — in the context of her letting her husband take three children away, and eventually losing the fourth one as well. So, I could see a — a breakdown, but I have no — I tried, through the Red Cross to — to — I wrote to the Red Cross and asked them if they had any kind of way of tracing someone in Lithuania, and the answer I got was basically that while the Germans The following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

   A: Yes. I had heard that, like in all the countries of Europe, and that includes Italy and Spain and Bulgaria; and you just name them all: Hungary, Romania, they all had local Nazi sympathizers. And so the — the story I heard was, once the Germans came in, even in a small group, and empowered the local se — sympathizers, they had people joining their group, local bigots, anti-Semites, or what have you, opportunists, and they just did what the Germans wanted them to do.

And we lived the good life when — you know, when we were able to go to these things. So th-the story is that they cut off the exit from town on the main road, and then rounded them up and took them to the woods and killed them.

   Q: Well, you know, this is one of the reasons why earlier, when we were talking about relations between Jews and non-Jews, and whatever your personal experience might have been in Zarasai, I wanted to get a sense of how you viewed whatever was going on there, in the context of other places, because if — if the message 1s that this was just as normal, you had a normal kind of life there, as there could be in any other place, that means that — that means a very spooky thing. That means that you put the right kind of forces together, and these things can happen anywhere. They didn’t ha — genocide didn’t happen everywhere.

   A: Yes, it will be a lot worse, because the world is becoming more crowded, and there’s less of 1t, because of climate change, which is encroaching on the lowlands. Islands are disappearing slowly, continents are shrinking and populations are growing, and food sources are becoming less abundant. And so we’re either gonna have to get along together, or perish together, eventually. I mean, I know a lot of people say I won’t live long enough to see the horrors of — 0-o-of — of global warming. And in my case that’s certainly true, I— I mean, I don’t have to worry about it happening in the next 25 years, because I’m not going to be here in 25 years. But my great-grandchildren, whom I love dearly, will be here in 25 years, and I want them to have a future, as I want everybody’s children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to have.

First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a train, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far: they were six or seven years old. But there’s — there’s so much that never arrived in Zarasai for them.

And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they’re known as the elevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground. And there’s a new train every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids would say to me, how many trains are there? And I would say oh, there are — they go around the whole city, and it’s just a continuous train tr — bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them about trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father. And air — airplanes that we watched take off and land. And they — they were staggered with — with curiosity.

   A: The — I learned a lot of how you — in Zarasai you didn’t have Woolworth’s and other stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed. If you needed a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find out how to make it was to consult the local people. My friend Karowlka(ph) taught me a lot of things; how to — how — how to — [’Il give you an example of something — to go fishing was a— a very interesting occ — pri— you know, business for us, and — because the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that’s very easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that’s just the right length and the right size, and you cut it down, and that’s your fishing pole. Now you need fishing line. Well, you can’t use just anything. But there are white horses, and white horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and there, and you braid them, and it turns into the — a-and then you — you have like a — maybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now you have a terrific fishing line.

Nobody knows how to make a fish hook. And the store always has fish hooks. So we went fishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and we ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also — you could buy sleds in the wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play — play with wood, and we would make our own sleds, they were simple things, but — but we di— we didn’t bother wi — sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to buy sleds.

   Q: You made your own ice skates?

And you put the straps — nail the straps to the piece of wood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with these things and had a wonderful time. So, we learned how — we learned how to swim, we learned how to ice skate, we learned how — how to catch fish. In the wintertime we got — we got sp — poles that were similar to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we put a —a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in the ice.
