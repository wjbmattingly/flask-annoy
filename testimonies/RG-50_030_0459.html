  <p id="22">
   A: Well, my father’s father sold -- so he was a s-s-salesman, I think [indecipherable] salesman, coal and other mat -- other material to heat. And my grand -- my grandmother, who was angel, she -- she wanted to -- to somehow to -- together the family, and she was a very good point -- meeti -- meeting point, not only because she was so nice, but because April 24, 2000 her cooking was so fantastic. And my grandfather was not very kind, so -- but, he was terribly religious. He went every day to the synagogue, and regularly, and Yom Kippur afternoon, the mincha, he was the maftir. You understand what I am ta-talking about? You know?

  <p id="28">
   A: No, no, no, no, no, not the Jewish week, no, no, no. The -- The -- The Jewish feast of a- and I think this is one of the best sides of the Jewish religion. The Torah will be read, and according to the importance of the day, seven plus one, or three plus one, are called to the Torah. The last, or the plus one is the maftir, whose role is -- whose -- whose role | is — beaucoup -Hndeeipherable} much more important than the -- than the rest. And, so usually he was the maftir, and he was ex-extremely proud of it. It’s a pity that he lived private life, he was completely different. William Blake says somewhere, “Humble to God, haughty to man.” And well, so was he.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   Q: This is your maternal grandfather?
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   A: No, th-the paternal --
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   Q: Paternal? April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   A: Yes. My -- My father was exactly the contrary, more than the contrary. He was a doctor, M.D., and a very good doctor, and an extraordinary man. Absolutely honest and generous. And his story is a little bit the story of many Hungarian Jews. He was born in 1902, and -- and 1920, he wanted to start his studies, the university, but just in 1920 has | been int-introduced the indecipherable} clausesnumerus claususclausus, so it means that, I don’t know, three percent of the students could be Jewish, or four, I -- I -- I -- I don’t know. S-So h-he had to emigrate, and he went to Germany, and in GeesonGieBen |Giessen], not far from Frankfuert, amimeam Main, he -- he became a doctor. And as he came back, the Hungarian authorities didn’t recognize his diploma, and he had to start again.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   Q: He left Hungary to study in Germany because Hungary had more -- at that time more restrictive laws?
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   | A: No, the indecipherable} clausesnumerus clausus has been introduced, and there was no place, because they had I don’t know how many Jews, and he -- he has been refused. So he had to -- he had to look for somewhere -- somewhere else. And -- And so | he -- he made his studies-, I don’t -- seven or eight years in GieBenGeesen, in Germany. I think he’s -- he finished in 1928, yes, it was before my -- my existence, and -- and he ki- then he went back to Hungary, and he tried to -- to use his diploma, it was no -- it was not possible. So for family reasons, because my grandfather whom I didn’t know, he was | a dentist, and this eabinae-cabinet had to be continued, and he agreed to be -- to become a dentist. April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   Q: Your father?
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   A: Yes, under the supervision of a -- of a-another dentist, who made his studies in Hungary. So I -- I -- I think it’s very confused -- very confusing, but it is -- 1t was very confusing. He had a complete diplome -- doctor, M.D., in medicine, from | GeesonGieBen. And as he came back eight years later, he couldn’t practice alone because he had no Hungarian diploma, and he -- and so the family had to engage a Hungarian dentist -- a Hungar -- a dentist having a Hungarian diploma. Meanwhile, he started -- he -- he tried to organize hi -- this Hungarian, a-uhs-and conification.cegnesratication indecipherable} It wasn’t possible, and somehow, I don’t know who helped him, he has -- he obtained the authoriz -- authorization to frequent the | Hungarian University, with was Pécsfindecipherable} ab-about 200 kilometers south from Budapest. So he started again, and he made all this ev-everything, so the -- all eight | or seven years in PagePécs, and I think I was the -- probably the unique case. I assisted in hi -- that he was officially made doctor. And it was -- I think it was quite late, sa -- like -- something like ’38. Two years, then he be -- he became independent of the other -- other dentist, because he had a Hungarian diploma. 1940, he has been called to the army, but the army -- I have the picture -- I have the picture for you. I don’t know if you can reproduce it. This is the complete misery, this picture, the complete misery of a man who- who was a double doctor, and -- and wear this horrible uniform. It took three month, his absence, and he came back, well 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   April 24, 2000 | A: And -- And the place where he was is aiz-audeniaEKradony although I do -- I don’t think it’s very important.
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   Q: Well where -- where in Hungary?
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   A: And today -- toda -- today it belongs to Romania.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   A: And so he started to build up his own life as a doctor, but two years later, the -- I -- I don’t know who made it, how, who decided, but the -- the four best going Hungarian | doctor -- doctors from my native town, SzekervarSzékesfehérvar, have been ordered to go to the army again. But it was not, this time, without uniform, and we had to send cloth and coat, and -- and whatever, underwear, to somebody who was in the -- not in the army, but 1-1-1 -- called working -- I don’t know what working, teams. All Jews, of course. And it finished by -- by the union -- the Soviet Union, the whole thing finished in the -- in the soviet -- the u -- Soviet Union. 1943 was the -- the big change in the Soviet Union, they started really to attack the Germans, until -- and then -- which -- which continued until May, ’45, until th-the end of the Hitler regime. But he -- as I -- and I know him from one | of his colleagues who came back, he didn’t, died because he couldn’t support! working for Ukrainian farmers in the -- as a prisoner, to be -- he didn’t want -- accept better life conditions than the others. So ex --

   Q: Y-You’re saying your father refused to get --
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   A: Yes. | | Note from interviewee’s son: "support" is meant in the French meaning of the word -&gt; He could not stand... April 24, 2000
  </p>

   Q: -- better li -- better living conditions --
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   Q: -- than others?
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   A: Yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   Q: Because -- Ok -- He -- He would have gotten those because he was a doctor?
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   | A: Ltold you at Prasure-hecoutdin the beginning, that he was an extraordinary honest man, and he didn’t see any reason to have better food and better treatment than his colleagues, because the colleagues -- or just because he was a doctor. And so he -- he became sick, and his legs were frozen, and he thought that they could be amp-amputated- amp --
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   Q: Amputated.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   A: Amputate -- amputed -- but it -- it didn’t take place, because he died. Very probably he du -- he didn’t know how sick -- how sick he was, and he died. So this was -- this was- means that practically, I -- I lost my father as I was 13, and [indecipherable] I -- I -- I never seen him any more.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   Q: How did you find out, at what point did you find out what happened to him?
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   A: Because we received a -- an official paper from the Hungarian army, that he disappeared. [indecipherable] disappeared or dead, or -- but in this case, because they didn’t find him, of course because he was a prisoner of war. On the other hand, he -- there was a -- there was a possibility dur -- that there -- the Moscow radio gave every day, messages. And my aunt -- [indecipherable] his -- his -- his sister received a visitor April 24, 2000 | who told her, that you are Miss bess--- Mrs. AlmasyAhmash, yes. Because I heard in the radio that your -- your f -- brother is alive, and is a prisoner of war. It was quite at the | beginning of f -- f -- °43, and according to this -- this friend, whom I saw later, he died probably May 224,
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   Q: I want to go back to when you are a young boy, and I wonder if you can tell me what your home life was like? What -- What did your house look like? What was it like to be inside of it?
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   A: Well, I think as nothing extraordinary. At the end of my peerin, before the deportation, I had two very good friends, both died, I will tell you about, as far as | alishees-Auschwitz concerned. And I have -- I -- I ha -- I was considered as a musical phenomenon. I had a very good voice, and -- and I -- I -- I could s-sing very properly. It went so far that I -- the accompaniment has been made by my mother. The executing of [indecipherable] was by Mo-Mozart. The -- The queen of the night, she -- who has two terribly difficult airs in the magic flute. And I could sing it. Famous -- Famous singers couldn’t. And so they -- everybody was very, very [indecipherable] how. So, and I don’t know whose idea it was, I went in September ’37, to Vienna, to the Wiener Sangerknaben eChorVema-zingertdubenkere, which ts the -- the little singers. I -- I don’t -- I don’t know how they call. The institution exists there-still today.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   Q: The Vienna Boy’s Choir?
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   A: Vienna Boy’s Choir, yes, the Vienna Boy’s Choir, yes. And the reception was very | friendly from a certain rekteshnitRektor Schnitt, and a Hungarian ha -- did -- the April 24, 2000 | conductor was a Hungarian named GembeshGombos. And they wanted to take me immediately, and then I try -- I -- I -- I -- I sa -- I cried that I want to go home to my -- my- me mum, etcetera. And the -- the bottom line was an agreement between them that I come -- I go home, I learn German, and in May °38, I come back. But in March, somebody else took the place, really, so in April we -- we received a letter that due the -- to the events, of course, you understand that your son will not come to Vienna.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   Q: If it was stated that subtly, that -- no more specific reference to what happened, just due to the events, your son will not come.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   A: So you ask little bit too much. It was 1938. How do you -- How do you want me to know in which terms they -- they told -- they wrote to my mother that there was no place for me any more? Of course, because -- because I am Jewish, and howa -- you know what happened in Austria. So I -- I stayed at home, and I went to school, and -- and as I finished the -- the -- the g¢renk- grand -- the elementary school, I wanted to go to the -- go to the gymnasium findecipherablelyceo} the gymnasium, eight years. The day I, by inscription, came, in 1939, the official dec-decree -- dec -- decree of the government, | concerning the numereus clausues in the -- in the grammar school -- not grammar school in -- in the college, but the director of the school was eight year -- during eight years, the main professor of my father, and I had been in it -- I -- I -- I got my inscription immediate, without any question, so -- so I went to school, and I could continue until ’44.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   Q: Let -- Let me clarify. You’re saying that when you were about to go to gymnasium, restrictive clause limiting the attendance of Jews -- April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   Q: -- were implemented. But you still were allowed to go, because of a family friend?
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   A: No, somebody else. I saw -- I -- I -- I imagine they had six places. They had six places, and they gave me one place without any -- any further examination, or whatever. I think the director was a very good man, and -- and --
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   Q: Was he Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   A: No. No, Jewish teachers have been prohibited, later. And -- And so he couldn’t -- he couldn’t do anything else, because he was in a -- a very honest man. And somehow he -- he -- he was not obliged to do it, but morally, yes. Because he knew -- he -- he -- he knew my father.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   Q: I know that you were a young boy before the war, but I still want to go back and see what things you do remember. C-Can -- A-A-And now you’re just mentioning your father. Can you talk a little bit about your father’s standing in the community? Did people know your father, did he take on any community tasks?
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   A: Well, I don’t know exactly his -- you want to know his social position, or something like that is your question?
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   Q: Social, or 1-1-1f people knew him in the community. If they did, what did they turn to him for?
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   A: [indecipherable] or the Jewish? April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   Q: The Jewish community. Well, or the -- or your -- or your larger community, if it was a more mixed.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   A: No, I think the way he -- so I -- I -- I’m -- I’m not sure -- I’m not sure to -- to be able to -- to give you a -- a correct answer, because this happened very long time ago, and as a child I never analyzed his social, or community, or whatever position. He -- He didn’t want to live in a Jewish ghetto, and he -- he didn’t want to -- to reduce his interest on Jewish interests. He -- He made his work extremely honestly, you saw the M.D., and In - what I positively know, that he treated people having no money at all, and he never asked them to pay, because he knew that they -- they was un -- they were unable to pay. He considered the -- this profession to do something necessary for -- for his -- he -- colleagues, for his -- not only for his friends, but for -- for human beings, and he -- I remember of a certain Marinka, who was a Gypsy lady, and who -- who didn’t wear shoes, and -- but who had -- he was -- she had problem with hi -- with her teeth, and so she -- she knew that he will -- she will not pay, and my father -- my father knew that he had -- can -- he cannot require -- cannot ask any money because she hadn’t. And so in -- she -- I think this -- this -- this was his -- his -- his exampler -- exemplary, and extraordinary side, that he considered his profession as really a profession for human beings, independently of their social level. She had for in -- He had a -- a patient who couldn't hear at all. She was sewing underwear and -- and then these kind of things, and sh-she couldn’t pay. She [indecipherable] a little bit underwear for the family, and you -- you couldn’t -- you couldn’t speak with her, because she didn’t under -- she didn’t hear. April 24, 2000 | So her only answer was, “JO van, j6 van¥uven,yuven.” It’s all right, it’s all right. But she didn’t know what was all right, and we didn’t know what she underst -- wh -- what she understood. [indecipherable] it became a sort of phenomenon, a -- a part of the -- of our lives is a [indecipherable] time, she arrives to sew, to -- to repair, because she couldn’t -- she couldn’t pay. So, I think this -- it is a very good thing. I have been told that he -- he has stolen something, it is the once only, but he has stolen what her -- his mother --

  <p id="76">
   Q: -- ition of tape one, with George Kadar, April 24", year 2000.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: He knows that his mother, every morning, went out looking for eggs, because she had chickens. And he went to see if there is -- the eggs are already here, and one egg was missing, and to not deceive his mother, he has stolen an egg from the -- from the kitchen, put in the place of the -- of the ch -- of the chicken to -- so -- so this is the only time he -- he is -- he has stolen.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: What can you tell us about your mother? What was it like to -- to be in the house with your mother?
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: She was a victim of the society. She was beautiful and intelligent, but her mother -- so my gr -- my -- my grandmother -- and I don’t know which -- what was the position of her father, but they didn’t want to -- they didn’t want her to study, because a woman doesn’t April 24, 2000 need it. And -- And so she -- she spoke two foreign languages, German and French, and she read a lot, and she was very interested by plenty of things. And it -- it couldn’t bring | anything, because -- because she -- she had to finish ed+h—her studies at 18. What for, I don’t know, because there was not too much to do. And I think that my grandmother was very limited. I don’t want the -- I don’t want any -- I -- I don’t want to say anything bad of somebody who finished his -- his -- his -- her -- or somebody -- her -- she -- who finished his day in Auschwitz. But I think that she had a great responsibility for the | family findeeipherable}what arrived’, because my father was on the uni -- the U.S. quota, and I think that she didn’t want to move because of the house. There was a house, built by her husband, the house was very beautiful, and -- and somehow I think that she didn’t understand any problem. Meanwhile, she spoke very well, German, less well French, and she read and she -- she -- she -- she was a -- an accepta -- I think an acceptable person, was -- very probably she didn’t understand anything from the world, but -- and I don’t -- I don’t know, seeing her example, how we could imagine th-the n -- n-n-north and east, south and west, the Nazi regime, or German occupation alre -- already has been made, and Hungary will remain independent. I think it was a very -- a very naive e -- idea.

   Q: Did -- Did your mother’s mother live with you? Did you live together?

  <p id="81">
   A: Yes, yes, yes.

  <p id="82">
   Q: So did you live in this beautiful house? | 2 Note from interviewee’s son: Literal translation from the French meaning of "ce qui est arrivé" -&gt; My father meant
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   April 24, 2000 | A: Yes, she didn’t -- she didn’t have a beauti-beautiful place in the -and-abeautiful house, because -- and particularly since my father started with -- went to the army once, and a secon -- a second time. So we had to -- we had to have money from somewhere, so we had a -- we took a small apartment in the -- in -- in the same beautiful house, and the two big apartments have been rented -- hired.

  <p id="84">
   Q: So, are you an only child?

   A: Yes.

  <p id="86">
   Q: Do you know why your parents didn’t have other [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: I think it is -- I think it’s better not to -- not to imagine a second or a third chi -- child, because in 1944, I was 15, and I was just the -- the -- the category of age who had the possibility to survive. 17 - 18 year old boys have been sent to work, and particularly in a - | - in a mine in Yu-Yugoslavia bor*berder. And I think from this mine, nobody came back. So I think -- I-I didn’t see anybody coming back from there. And younger brothers or sisters could have been eliminated immediately in Auschwitz, the first day. So -- So I have just the age -- just the age you were permitted to exist, to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Do you think that your parents decided not to have more children because they saw trouble brewing in -- in 1932 - ’33?

   Q: Can you talk a little bit about the role faith and religion played at home? Did your family observe the Sabbath, and in -- and in what ways?
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: No, no. It’s -- I mentioned two friends, and religion was an obligation in the school, as mathematics, or physics, or Hungarian literature. And we had a marvelous rabbi, really a marvelous man, and -- who -- who died the first day in Auschwitz. He wasn’t -- He wasn’t old, I think he -- he was born 1906. So he was 30 -- 38, and -- and so somehow, he arrived to -- to invite us to the synagogue, and we went regularly to the synagogue, and we observed -- we really observed everything, even I think -- even the -- the day of Gedarea [indecipherable] thing -- thing of less importance. And my -- my parents didn’t | say anything, so they! considered that it very probably aswe-- it’s something which comes and goes, which really happened.

   Q: They were not?
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: No. No, no, no. No, not at all. And I think my -- my father had a very bad reaction against his father, who reg -- who went regularly to the synagogue, and on -- and on the same time, a man who -- who was quite brutal and tasteless. Very -- Very probably, but we -- we never spoke of this, so I -- I -- I don’t know.

   Q: What did your parents teach you about being a Jew? I mean, how did you learn about that as you grew up, or what things do you remember? | 3 Bor, Serbia, where there is a large copper mine April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: Oh, I didn’t need my parents, because to be a Jew, and learn in Hungary, in that | period of -- of Hhorthy, h-o-r-t-h-y. It wasn’t -- It was not very difficult, cause 1-it -- it started with the fact that my father couldn’t study, so -- so the -- and -- and in -- in the school, different remarks, that you have killed our Jesus, etcetera, and -- and to -- finally, the children in the s -- in the school were products of their parents, and -- and I think that if you -- if you are a -- if you are a -- a salesman, and -- and you are not honest with your- with your clients -- they say that Mr. Meyer was not honest, but if the Mr. Meyer is a Jew, then the Jewish -- the Jewish salesman, Mr. Meyer, etcetera. So, to be -- to be a Jew, it belongs to the profession of the -- to the person, to -- to the imagination of people. And, you know, I don’t know who -- who is -- who -- who said that the anti-Semitism doesn’t need any Jews, and you can’t be a ga -- you can’t be an anti-Semite if -- if never, never in your life, you never have seen one single Jew. It’s all -- I don’t know if you remember, it happened long years ago, kind of a Gallup question in Austria, it was long | time before the present regime indecipherable} -- the actual -- regime -- how many Jews are in Austria, and people, certain people said 1,000,000, and in fact, I think 7,000, because the Austrian Jews have been -- have been killed in the meantime. Or, do you want a nay -- a Jewish neighbor? 30 percent said no. Or, do you want to shake the hand of a Jew? 30 percent or 31 percent said no. And they really, they ca-cannot know a lot of Jews. April 24, 2000

  <p id="100">
   Q: So then how, as a young man, did you regard being Jewish? I mean, you didn’t have a lot of input in a religious way, it was an in -- it was a burden in terms your father was. How did you think about it as your identity?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: As -- I -- I think I -- I told you what I could, because I don’t know what -- what could have been added to -- to these outside remarks, criticisms, and -- and so I think you -- you can, and you must accept the fact. So, as -- if you see somebody who, he only has one leg, so he -- finally he accepts the fact, it vee -- to live with one leg, is still better than not to live at all. So, there is a s-simple fact for the --

  <p id="102">
   Q: You’ve talked a lot about your father being very generous, and honest, and you’ve talked about your mother being very bright. Would -- What things did your parents teach you? | A: Thisat is extremely difficult to say, because as I lost my father, I was 13, my mother, 15. And -- And if you th-think of general teaching, I think that -- that my father was more | important in this domain thanindecipherable} I think, even if he left earlier. My mother, it was -- she was different, because we did all the daily light -- th-the -- the -- the daily life. The preparation of the next -- the next -- the next day, to -- to ask questions of history or -- or literature, or whatever, because the next day, I had these lessons. And she learned with me piano -- piano playing, so she -- she sat down and spent hours at the piano with me every day. So, I didn’t become a pianist, this is -- this is not the question, but -- but her participation in the -- in the daily life was |-longer and more important.

  <p id="103">
   Q: So you had a piano at home? April 24, 2000

  <p id="106">
   A: Yes, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   Q: Mm-hm. | A: Yes. OneWell, findecipherable} varietyit was a rarity, but cause I -- I -- I had a very old gramophone, and later an electric one, with mechanic in it. And -- And I had a couple of -- a couple of records. The Beethoven Violin Concerto I remember. The Bach double Concerto i-in D minor. The Eine Kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart. I think this was -- I | don’t know what else, and a record by myself, because I have been rdecorded ma -- by my parents. They wanted to -- They wanted to -- to her -- to ge -- to save -- safeguard the- the -- my -- to -- my voice, and IJ -- Is -- I sung the second air of the Queen of the Night, and the Halleluia by Mozart, which was a very important thing. At this time, went the movie, were a hundred men, one girl with StokowskyWestakeffsky and DeannaDiana Durbin sung the ca -- the Halleluia. And of this record, five examples have been pressed in five different houses, and all the five houses have been destroyed. I couldn’t f -- I couldn’t find my -- my voice. I -- I -- otherwise, I could prove that I really sung this very difficult ple-pieces. It’s will play another -- another role, not the Halleluia, | but the Greek Grieg Solveigservike -- servike Solveig sung-song in the concentration camp.

   Q: What did you -- What were you thinking you might be when you grew up? Let’s say when you were 10 and 11 and 12, maybe before the war seems very real. April 24, 2000

   A: I -- bus driver. I -- I think it’s, you know, my dream, or a controller of -- of -- on the bus, you know, who sell -- who sells the tickets, who is selling tickets.

  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: You -- You mentioned Hungarian literature, and we’ve mentioned that once, and he- here’s a -- a variation, I suppose, on a question I’ve asked you, which is what were your thoughts about being Hungarian? Did you know a lot about Hungarian history --
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: Oh, we learned it, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: Did you feel Hungarian? Did you identify with it?
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: Oh, you know, this is a -- it’s a very funny question, because I think of the answer, the first -- first three years of the elementary school, I made, in the Jewish elementary school in hu -- in Hungary, in Budapest -- in -- in SzékesfehérvarSzekervar. The firstfourth year I couldn’t, because of my grandmother, maternal -- ma -- the mat -- on maternal side, and --

  <p id="116">
   Q: She wouldn’t let you?

  <p id="117">
   A: No, no. At the -- At the end of the -- of the third year, a-and every year there was a -- a- in the court findecipherable} of the school, a gymnastic, and I don’t know what series on music, upon music, organized by a teacher who called Kéves baciKurasbaeei, and -- _ and this man was a gu -- big hero of the Hungarian army, a Jewish man, who had I don’t April 24, 2000 know how many medals from the first World War, and who -- who every year, I think December 10" or 11", every year we had to listen to his history story in the first World War, beca -- the -- the -- the -- the Battle of LimanowalLimaeneyva. Nobody knows where LimanowaLimaeneya, it’s somewhere in Poland, or in -- and -- and he -- and then the year of the s -- the end of the s -- this school year, who he played his piece, a Hungarian resurrection. And in this piece, the end of the play, I -- I don’t remember exactly what the- how it was, because I know that the -- at the end of the piece, two angels -- two angels presented the -- the -- the -- not the cart -- the geographical cart of great Hungary.
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: The map.
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: The map.
  </p>
  <p id="120">
   Q: Yep.
  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: The map of great Hungary, before having lost two third of the Hungarian territories. This man, March 15", arrive in the synagogue, which was the -- everybody went to this, according to his religion, to synagogue, or church, or Temple, because it was th -- t -- th- the day of the Hungarian revolution, 1848. He arrived in Hungarian uniform, as a lite -- a | jeertnunlieutenant, and -- and we prepared Hungarian flags with the Magen David in the middle.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: So this man, he was the teacher of you know, the gymnastic, and in the -- in this schoolyard, only three ranks of -- of -- of -- of chairs, and my grandmother sat down in | the first li -- the first row -- line, or wh-whatever. And he started to cry that the first April 24, 2000 raung is reserved, please take another one, and my grandmothers went out furious, and didn’t tolerate that I continue this school with the Jewish 1_--ay teachers. And well, I had goo -- good relationship with the -- with my old teacher, whose wife was my pi-piano teacher for a moment -- for a couple of years. And he was the religion teacher as well. And was the issue to -- to understand, so the example of this -- of this Kéves bacikurasbacei, Uncle Kéves, K-o -- double poin-point, v-e-s, he was a Hungarian patriot, and he tried to educate the -- this Jewish children in the -- 1-in Hungarian patriotism, and of course it was grotesque. It was ridiculous, the whole -- the -- the -- the | method of LimanowaLimaeneval, the Hungarian resurrection, so all these ils -- and the Magen David, there is this hor-horrible ideas, and he finished exactly as the others. Later, the Jewish officers lost -- lost their military rank, and on a -- every man had a | militar -- a military book, and with an enormous stamp ZS, zhide-zsid6 ---- Jewish: out. So of -- of course it was -- it was horrible that -- that the Hungarian authorities did it, because even 1-if somebody who -- who -- plenty of enthusiasm, struggled -- struggled and -- and -- and wanted to -- and wanted to -- to -- to underline his first: Hungarian, second: Jewish si -- situation. So this perhaps the answer. My father and my mother, there was absolutely no question about that, but we had to put out the flag for several anniversaries, and then the -- and so on. Everybody did.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Ca-Can you talk a bit about your family’s political ideas? Did you know what they were? April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: The family’s political ideas? My father had not -- I -- I don’t think he had particular political ideas. My mother was more active. A great part of the Hungarian -- of the -- of the Hungarian Jews in -- in this town went to the -- to the left side. They thought that the situation is so horrible, it only can be resolved otherwise, not in -- to a -- just to leave, just to resort -- to have the opportunity to leave, to learn, to teach, to -- which, these opportunities have been -- have been slowly excluded. It -- In Hungary there was two series of Jewis -- so-called Jewish laws. In 1939, and then 1941, and many professions -- many professions, Jewish, were eliminated. And this will give you an example, the publicity. There was a -- a glass muratmirror, I don’t know what salesman, a findecipherable} big shop in Hungary called Schnietzler, and in -- in -- in -- in SzékesfehérvarSzekeryvar, in Hungary. And Schneitzler made a publicity in the movie, sh -- buy glass mirrors in the shop of Schneitzler. Schneitzler is the only non-Jewish salesman in this -- in this rebreekrubrique. Of course I wouldn’t I-I wouldn’t buy something fr -- because he is Jewish or not Jewish. The idea, to -- to make a publicity, these are the only non-Jewish salesman, is all -- it’s -- in this profession, I think 1s horrible.

  <p id="126">
   Q: You’ve talked about the two laws, and you just gave that story. Things begin -- End of Tape One, Side B April 24, 2000 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   Q: This is an interview with George Kadar, conducted by Katie Davis, on April 24", in the year 2000, at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This is tape number two, side A. I'll begin asking that question again, which is, can you describe how things began to change in your life, as the new laws were passed, and restricted the ability of Jews to be in professions, or -- and just as things begin to change in Hungary, and perhaps you were hearing also about other parts, other countries?
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   A: No, no, 1-it is -- it 1 -- this thing -- I was not too much concerned, because I went to school before and after. What really happened, that in Hungary, there was so-called | Levente-mozgalom, Levantherindecipherable} LeventeLevanther, old Hungarian name, and it was in Germany the old -- old names came -- came up with these different | Fascist or semi-Fascist movements. In Hungary, LeventeLevanther, and -- and it meant that in the school, one -- once in the week, three hours of patriotism, or -- and the Jews | couldn’t be LeventeLevanther, because they were Jewish, and -- and -- but to -- to make certain works -- this is absolutely no -- no reason, just to -- just to have an occupation | parallel to the Levente Leyanther-movement, with -- with yellow armband, because it was yellow, the Jewish colors, you know, and baptized Jewish who -- so who racially were Jewish, but administratively not, they had a white armband. And so it 1s -- it is -- this was diff -- it was different, because the -- this -- the sure friends of -- comrades did something completely different, so it was a -- the first -- the first place, the Jewish children were ousted. April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   Q: Ousted?
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   Q: School-wise?
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   A: Yes. No, not from the school, from the movement, so they -- cause they -- the not Jewish peop -- the not Jewish colleagues made -- made something different. The second thing was deportations started from other countries earlier than in Hungary. And once, in Friday evening, the -- this famous rabbi made a great speech, and par -- and it was, I think, about -- about Christmas. Christmas -- the Christmas tree apparently has been invented by Martin Luther. And Luther propose also to send out the Jews to work. And in connection to this, he said that he positively knew that locked trains trasversed -- | traversed the gare vard-- the railway station of our town. He didn’t know where they were going, but he -- he knew that they came from Italy. And -- And he suggested that Jewish families forget about the Christmas tree this year. I don’t know, I -- how we reacted in this time, but -- but we -- but he knew the deportation was in the neighborhood. He didn’t n -- He didn’t say that the next victim, ou-ou-ourselves, but he warned us against something. So this was -- this was nothing in relationship with the hung -- with the law, but it was in relationship with the time of the law, approximately.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   Q: Do you remember what your thoughts were when you heard that story?
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   A: I think that we reacted as people who do not g -- do not want to -- to accept the fact of Auschwitz. It was a kind of -- of a fly away from the -- from the reality, and to unde -- and to understand that Hungary will continue t -- a-as I told you, as independence, as far April 24, 2000 as -- as possible. I didn’t hear any reaction, say that if it is so, then we have to go. | Everybody indecipherable} should have gone.
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   Q: Was there ever earlier -- or ever, that you remember, any talk of your family leaving Hungary, perhaps trying to go to a neutral country, just out of Europe, let’s say. | AQ: I see -- I told you that my father was in the quota, so h-he -- he knew why he did it, and -- but somehow, I think that in the family, he wasn’t taken very seriously because -- because he -- he said several times that this is the train, which he will ta-take to go to see | Italy. There was a dear -- a direct -train extreme-between Budapest and -- and Venice, and I don’t know where it -- I think Buda-Budapest -- Venice, with beautiful Italian cars, beautiful. And -- And he couldn’t realize this dream because he had no money, and perhaps because he couldn’t realize one project, perhaps the second project has not been taken seriously. I don’t know, I don’t remember, I -- I just imagine an answer on your -- on your -- on your question, I don’t know whether I’m right.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: You mentioned that you heard the rabbi give a speech, and that was in synagogue?
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: I wonder if you can talk a little bit more. I know we’ve touched on this, but I understand that your father and mother weren’t very religious, and you went, but what did you take from there? Did you have -- I mean, what was attractive about going, to you?
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: This is what I told you, that these -- these three friends went everywhere, and -- and it belongs somehow, the -- to the daily life, and I don’t know if they are more or less April 24, 2000 convinced, as I was, I don’t know. But we were together, we wer -- we went together, and we liked the rabbi. And -- And we had a -- so -- so common moments, reactions of | happenings in the synagogue, and so kind of -- of complicity. There# was a very old man, he’s Goldberg. And Mr. Goldberg was very old, and very sleepy, and -- and everything went I th -- I think th -- slowly for him, because he -- he knew everything by heart, and -- and then he -- he manifested in a very funny way aaaahhhhh, aaaaaayy, and a -- and of course he -- he was -- the rabbi was smiling, and we smiled together, because -- because the poor -- the poor old man expressed his -- his -- his sentiments very f -- very curious way.
  </p>
  <p id="140">

   Q: How about the war?
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   A: The war, oh I think we didn’t understand too much of the war, and -- and we didn’t | understand particularly na -- the general catastrephycatastrophee of the -- of -- of the attack against the Soviet Union. And the war was [indecipherable] was fascinating, | because they advanced, they went until Moscow, and it is a phenomenon}, it was extremely -- plenty of tension, and -- and -- and -- in-interest.

  <p id="153">
   Q: H-How would you hear about it?

  <p id="154">
   A: Oh, oh, I don’t -- I don’t understand the question.

  <p id="155">
   Q: H-How would you keep up with the news? Was it through newspapers or other ways? Was it the radio?
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   A: Newspapers, radio, and then -- and simple -- simple human beings.
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   Q: Mm-hm. So -- So was sitting around listening to the radio something that your family did?
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   | A: Yes, awa -- sok, the radio has been confiscated by the police, because we were supposed to listen to the -- to the BBC, and -- and -- which we did. And one day I came from school, a policeman was sitting in our apartment, radio control, but th-the radio was not open, so nobody -- nobody listened to anything, which didn’t change he -- and th -- to- in his attitude. You know, you don’t need the Jews to be an anti-Semite, you don’t need to listen to something, or to not to listen to something to be caught with that, that you did April 24, 2000 it. And so the radio has been confiscated, we had to -- to give the radio to a -- kind of a -- a radio shop.
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   Q: Do you remember about when this was?
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   A: I think ’43, ?'m -- I’m -- ’'m not sure.
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   Q: Can you just talk a little bit about how the town changes, if it does? Is there any more open anti-Semitism, you know, in addition to the story you just t-told, and to -- to other things you’ve mentioned, but is the atmosphere in your town changing?
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   A: The atmosphere in Hungary, there was an excellent German paper, which called | Pester Lloydasterleyd, a paper which has been made entirely in Hungary, and entirely by Hungarian Jews, who -- who knew German, who knew really German. And it went so far into parliament, an interperlation happened, or happened li -- has been done a question to the government, how is possible that this paper is still -- i-is still made by a Jew? So nobody was interested to know why, why, really why, becau-because -- because he s -- he -- he -- he spoke German. He was perfect in German, a Hungarian journalist re- making a German paper. You know, to these extreme events belong -- belongs the reign of ignorance, and it happened after the war, just to illustrate it, after the war, a couple of years after the war in Hungary, the -- the Soviet regime has been introduced by Hungarians, and it has been declared a -- th-the -- the worker’s class should take over the main -- the -- the most interesting, the most important places. And so, they found a tramway conductor who the m -- who’s a very nice man, has a beautiful voice, but he wasn’t a good announcer because he -- he has not the necessary culture, and -- and they April 24, 2000 announced, ladies and gentleman, you are listening to the excerpts of “The Miserables,” by Hugo, the fifth. Because Victor Hugo, the V point Hugo, and Hugo -- Hugo the fifth wrote this piece. And for me, it is a -- it is after the wa -- it was after the war, but this kind of -- of solid ignorance, I know that my -- I -- I -- I -- I called them since I knew this- this tramway conductor. This is also Hugo the fifth. And Hugo the fifth arrived every time when a -- when a regime changes, and the old -- the old professionalists -- professionalists h-have been changed by people knowing nothing, and which -- which -- which always meant a kind of Hugo the fifth.
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   Q: As things began to really tighten up, and as you said, as ignorance arrived, a solid ignorance re-emerged --
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   A: This is hopeless.
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   Q: I know you were young, but --
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   A: It is hopeless. This is hopeless. So the -- the end of the Hungarian regime I didn’t see, because I wa -- I was in Auschwitz, but this is exactly, you know, somebody -- | somebody’s trying to -- to burn the Jewish -- the synagogue in Lubbee-Liibeck for instance. What do you do? You -- You go to these people and say, “Listen, this is not correct. You shouldn’t burn the synagogue.” So this is -- this is not possible. How do you want to -- to speak with them? About what? Based on what?
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   Q: So what happens, though? Do you just become --
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   A: Nothing. We waited. We -- We had a very good newspaper, who -- in this paper, you could read very interesting things, a little bit hidden, of course. And until the -- until the April 24, 2000 very day, the March 19", ’44, when the -- when the country was officially occupied by the Germans, and it was the -- and that was the end.
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the days leading up to that? Did you expect the country to be occupied by the Germans?
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   | A: No, we didn’t expect. The -- The Prime Minister who calledHekuy Kaallay, K-aa- double I-a-y, he wanted to establish a certain balance between -- between east and west. And I think they played with the idea to -- to -- to jump out on the whole thing. And | Kaallay announced a great speech, for the 19 of March, in the evening. On the 19" of March, the Germans were priso -- were there. So the -- the -- the speech did not happen, and the Germans were in Hungary March 19", On March 22", government has been formed, and the first -- the first Prime Minister was the -- the ex-ambassador in Berlin, of the Hungarian kingdom. We didn’t -- We didn’t have a king, but this is | anotherfindecipherable} question.
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   Q: Do -- How do you remember seeing Germans arrive into your town?
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   A: This was horrible. This was horrible. This is something where my -- I -- I really remember. I was sick, and -- and the news, I -- I -- I heard the news, by my mother, grandmother, paper, etcetera. And -- And we knew that it was somehow the end.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   Q: Can you -- Can you describe what happened on the street?
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   A: On the streets, nothing. More German soldiers. But they-they-they didn’t happen on the street, 1t happened everywhere. The street -- The street didn’t react, nobody reacted hor -- but the critical position of the new government was quite clear, and the extreme April 24, 2000 right government, with this prime minister, it was absolutely evident that they -- they will do what -- what the Germans command.
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   Q: Did you have any face to face interactions with German soldiers? Can you tell us about that?
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   A: No, no, no, no. No, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t speak German, and I -- I had no reason to speak to the German soldiers.

It | called WaldseeVahizee, so, you can imagine a -- a German sanitorium with the sun, and _- and -- and beautiful water. This a --This has been made with such a cynism, which is - which werefindeeipherable} I think, which was at the ex -- at the same level as the -- as the -- the ki -- the killing organization.

  <p id="210">
   A: There was food and water. I don’t know -- I -- I -- I don’t know which kind of water we had 56 years ago. I -- I don’t know, but I -- but I -- I do know that we are no -- we are not -- we -- we are not starving. The problem was not this, the problem was this -- the -- it was very, very hot, and -- and -- and this is a very little place, very hot, and nobody knew what -- what -- what is happening. Of course, we had different informations that the -- the committee of I don’t know what decided, and the committee, and the -- the -- the -- the president of I don’t know, that the -- you know, in -- in -- in -- in such a situation, you have a lot of -- of news, gossips, and the fact was, was I -- that I -- what I’m telling you about the dis -- of couple -- a couple of days in the -- in the brick factory, we had the -- we had -- we -- we came this train, and 76 person -- no, no, 67 -- 67 persons were in one - this car for -- for animals, locked and of course we -- during the -- the travel, the Germans tried to blackmail, and if -- y-yeah, you can get water, if you give -- if we -- we can get a -- a -- a gold watch. Or, you can get, I don’t know what, if. So -- And it has been known by the SS, [indecipherable] by the SS, because they know, they only knew- they also knew that in Auschwitz, they d -- they -- they won’t get anything. They didn’t get anything, Auschwitz was a complete different organization.

  <p id="211">
   Q: S-So, when you were in the train, and it’s locked, are your mother and grandmother with you, or were you s -- had you been separated?
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   A: No, no, families were together, generations were together, and you can’t imagine, for instance, the -- the toilet situation between people of 10 weeks old, or 73 years. So -- So April 24, 2000 organizes with the -- with the towels, and I don’t know, this was ve-very, very, very difficult.
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   Q: Do you remember any of your thoughts at that time, or conversations perhaps, with your mother?
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   A: No. No. On there -- there -- you know, I 0 -- I wouldn’t say that I -- I was a child in the -- 15 is a little bit more, but I was always terribly interested by trains and bus. You know, it bi -- I wanted to become a bus driver, and -- and I -- for instance, I al-always wanted to go to a certain Hungarian town which I never seen, and -- and when -- when the -- this -- the train stopped in this ware -- in this -- this town, and behind the station there was a -- a tramway, I was very interested by the tramway, the color of the tramway in this town, and -- and I learned, for instance, the water, drink water in s -- Slovakia, | which called pit nawoada, and I learned this word dur -- in this -- in this locked train, because it -- because it di -- it was also interesting. Or the -- in the blue light of trains, or | of other trains, or all the -- in the -- the -- the kind of -- of running, it wasis-als -- it was very interesting. So, you -- you cannot consider it like a death march, pure -- pure death march, A, because we didn’t know it, B, because the life is so colored. And so if you -- if you -- if you -- if you are in a horrible situation, and you see something else, you hear a bird whistling, or what, so the -- you -- your attention is spread.

  <p id="215">
   Q: C-Can you remember what it sounded like to be in that car? April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="216">
   A: Acar? A train. A train. But, of course, you’re right, because it was a train only of two axis and a -- and a -- an express train had Pullman cars, four axis, and -- and it -- it goes more smoothly than this two axis animals -- best -- an-animal trains.
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   Q: What about the people inside, were they quiet or noisy?
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   A: Oh, I think it was a mixture of -- of -- of sadness, history, fears -- well, you can imagine that 67 people during three days in such a car, I think there is -- it -- itself very disturbing, but it was not that bad, it -- later, because we -- in the -- we had -- we could eat before, and the starving period ex -- started later, and the deaths -- the deaths in this quantity, this -- this started much later.
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   Q: Co-Could you sit down in the car? | A: Sit down oim what?
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: Or were you a -- were you standing or seated in the train?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: [indecipherable] Well, of course we can sit down everywhere, so we -- th-they didn’t give beds and then the -- well, you know we had to -- we had to sit on -- on -- on the luggage, or -- or stand a little bit and sit down later on, so what you can, and what you can’t do if you are -- if -- if 67 persons are on co -- a couple of -- of square meters.

   Q: Can you describe arri -- your arrival at Auschwitz? I mean, what does the train do, and how are you let out of the train?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Jumping. Jumping. And men and women have been immediately separated, so I never- I never s -- I never seen any more my mother. I don’t know what she wa -- what happened. I didn’t know, I ma -- of course I know. But, I went to the man, and -- and --
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   April 24, 2000 and we saw that the women went with the women. And I suppose that she didn’t want to leave alone her mother, and as I understood later, the doct -- Dr. Mengele, you know who he was, Dr. Mengele didn’t care if somebody wanted to die, he was much more nervous if he selected somebody for death, and -- and the [indecipherable] tried to -- to get out. This is -- So if he -- she wanted to follow her mother, okay. One -- One person more, or less. The first day was quite terrible, because -- at first because we didn’t know anything, and then we had to go to the -- to the -- to different places, disinfection, barber, shaving, the shower, and -- and this uniform, you know, this -- for prisoners, which went approximately. So we had a -- a jacket, pant, a h-hat -- hat, and shoes. Shoes, wooden shoes, with some textile, and -- but th -- but you are -- you were marching on the -- on the- on the wood -- on -- on the wood. I -- This my -- One of my most horrible souvenir, the shoes, because of -- because of the death march, between January 18" and 21%, day and night, on the ice, and the snow. I think this was one of the most horrible points of -- of the- of this time. | Q: And in fact, when you arrived here today in Washington, before this interview, we went to the museum, and you wanted to see a pair of those wooden shoes, and a -- I just wonder if you could explain why that that was so -- | A: Because I went to the ShoahShaw Museum in -- in Los Angeles, and -- and I was frightened by -- everything was very clean, and everything you know, in boxes. So if you | go to anormal museum, and in the box you see a Rembrandt, or a DiirerPederer, and _ here you said -- you f -- you saw, I think, My Kampf -- “Mein Kampf,” by Adolf April 24, 2000 | Hitler, and -- and in another box was a eks-oerthe-shoe. And -- But the shoes, yo -- on ya- on one hand, you cannot expl -- you cannot expl-explain what they were, and on the other hand, you should do it, because -- because shoes -- shoes is not very beautiful, but - but your -- but si -- approximately 60 kilometers, so nearly 40 miles in these shoes, under those circumstances, in -- this is -- these -- something so horribly inhuman, and if you -- if you want to understand this -- this story of -- of Auschwitz, then you -- and this is one of the main points. So, you know, the whole thing is so that I’m sure that the time - | - time will make its job-Hndeeipherable} and it -- and y -- if the -- the -- the exhibition of these objects is not convincing, [indecipherable] enough, in -- in -- in a couple of years, | people will speak of these horrible things, as they mentioned today, the history of the three year -- th-thirty year war, 1618 and ’48, between Protestants and then Catholics. And everybody knows that it was horrible. A great German writer, | GrimmelshausenGrimashausen, wrote a book calling simplySimplicissimussisymus. S -- It means the most simple one. And if you read this book, this is not ma -- he is not better or worse than the deportation. I think the huma -- humanity always found fantastic things to -- to make suffer other people. Unfortunately, we had such a treatment, with much more perfection, weapons, and possibilities. Da -- In the times of Grimelhau -- | GrimmelshausenGrimashausen, there was no gas, and they couldn’t kill as many people they wanted. But now, the technique was at a very high level, and the organization permitted to kill so many people. April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   Q: Do you remember when you -- how did you realize that people were being killed with gas at Auschwitz? When and how?
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   A: It’s not the gas, but the -- the -- the fire. Because the fire came out, and very often you heard a horrible -- you smelled something horrible, which was between burned meat and fat, and so which was in fact, a human body. And this -- it came out, this fine, black rain. So it -- it was n-no doubt that people have been killed.
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   Q: Did people talk about it? The pr -- other prisoners?
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   A: Yes, of course. In there we had nothing else to -- yes, we had, because the -- the food was very poor, a kind of artificial jam, and margarine, and we always -- we had a dream, | this -- with the three, that after the war, when it will befindeeipherable} finished, we will mix margarine with this kind of jam, and to eat it together. Never happened. They died, and I never did it.

   Q: Were you in a -- Were all your towns -- Were all the townspeople from your town, the men, I guess, let me rephrase that. Were the men from your town housed together? | A: Awfur-What for the men-? I don’t understand the question.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: When you were given bunks, were you housed with other men from your town?
  </p>

   A: [indecipherable] I think yes. I think yes, but it di -- di -- didn’t bother us, and no-not necessarily in the train. The train all -- all in Auschwitz we didn’t know about.

   Q: Okay. So you met up with your friends, were you able to sleep in the same space?
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: I don’t remember if we slept in the same place. Maybe yes, or from time to time. Sleeping on the same place, it was very adventurous because we had nothing, no -- no beds, and absolutely nothing. We had only a - how do you call the “planche”’?hartiele-de _ eS

   Q: Mat? A plank?

  <p id="245">
   A: Yes, a plank. Not a plank, but planks. And on the planks, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t lay down, because y -- so many people, and no place. So it’s called this sitting -- marine sitting. You know what it is? It -- It -- I was sitting so, so the -- the two legs -- in between the two legs, another one. Between his legs another one. Six or seven persons, so -- and -- and so -- so if you -- it was -- I don’t know where it -- where it -- why it called marine April 24, 2000 | sitting, or sitting aa la marine, or I -- I don’t know. And the planks became more and more rare, because the commander of the -- al-also a prisoner, who distributed the food, has stolen a lot, and he needed something to make fire, so not only has he s -- stolen a part of the margarine and the -- and the -- and these things, but he has stolen also the planks, and the -- the -- as the planks were -- became more and more rare, and you -- you | found yourself between two planks, it was very -- very dolorousdelereus.

And instead of avoiding me, he struck me on -- on my -- on my back, because he wa-want -- he wanted me to go out of his way. This was the Gypsy, later he died, very probably. Then came the Polish kapos, an absolutely horrible, horrible part of humanity. They had the right, for instance, to -- apparently, because they did it, to exchange people selected for the -- for | the gas, because they knew somebody, or -- in the meantime, I profited somewhere off this attitude. And -- And then the -- the SS, it was -- the contact with the SS was not direct. The contact was every day, the so-called appelle, you know re -- what it is -- what it was. And -- And so, if -- if one person was missing, they had to start again, to count again, but it took hours, and you can imagine then, it happened to me, that th-the food was so horrible that I became a very gr-great diarrhea, and I couldn’t go out, because we had to stay there, and I -- I -- I had no solution, so it went. And very bad sign, flies were coming -- is wa -- by the way, flies were the only animals we saw, plus the SS dogs, but there was no butterfly, nothing, no birds, just flies. And -- And so 1-1-1-it was a extreme -- extremely bad, the appelle, and the -- but this has been ordered by the SS. I -- What I don’t understand, the logic of the whole thing, because if somebody was missing, it was not sure, and there never was one -- plus one, only minus one, and -- and they had to find out where it -- where he was. So it -- it took time. The Jewish commanders, or the sous-commandersHndeeipherable} were also quite bad because -- because they -- they -- they regularly stole the midare--- the -- the food. You know, I had a couple of times, contact with Mengele, because he came several times to select. And the selections, April 24, 2000 | which;+ you know what it was, first the -- the cynism, because the first selection took place on September 15", which was Rosh Hashanah. The second for Yom Kippur, so they -- they apparently knew the Jewish calendar. And then I -- I think that nobody spoke of the smiling side of Mengele. Mengele could smile, and he selected the deaths smiling, with rapture, a little bit. And if somebody didn’t obey, then he became very angry. But he -- But otherwise, he was smiling, and -- to make this job. You know, there is something very perverse in the whole thing. For instance if the -- the | Gauleitergauti¢hter, or I don’t know, the commander -- not commander, was something like that, commander -- I -- I -- I don’t know [indecipherable] the military, or [indecipherable] the man who -- Frank, a very, very famous and a horrible man of Hitler, who was the commander of Poland, after having finished his job, he went home to play Bach on the piano, because this is German culture. I could tell you something | else, which is perhaps not a direct answerfindeeipherable} but the -- to understand this mentality, a -- a -- excuse me, but I -- I think I -- I will say it, if you don’t want it, leave it out. I had a -- I have a sister-in-law in Berlin, and we -- we went very often to Berlin, and I know a -- a -- a good friend in north Germany, who is a chor -- chorus -- choir -- choir conductor, and a man who -- with incredible knowledge. And his first wife, or the daughter of a lady who is living -- the lady lived in Bielefeld Vi-Vidafeld, and the daughter said, “You know, Paris and indecipherable} Berlin is so far. Go to my mother, the house is big, and you can -- you can take a rest -- at night.” And we did this several times. In 1977, when our si_ thi-third boy was born, I -- I examined the boy, of April 24, 2000 course, as a good father, and I considered that his ears were a little bit different of the other ears of the family. It wa -- He was born in September, and a couple of months later, | we went to Christmas, to Berlin with this station, she -- Madame S.Ess. And do you know, after dinner, kinder -- the children went to bed, and after dinner nobody in Germany will sit down with a -- with white wine to gossip, and to [indecipherable] and | on this day, Mrs. S.Ess said, “You know, it was in the period with my -- my husband was _ in prison.” “Your husband in prison? How?” “My daughter never told you?” “No.” And, “He was in prison.” “Why?” “Because he was a very high SS officer, and his specialtyspecialty was to examine Jewish n-noses and ears.” And Madame -- Madame S.Ess, when we arrived, I told her that this is very different from the others, and she examined very carefully the ears, but I don’t know why. And after dinner, I learned that not only her husband was a high officer for racism, but his brother as well. In the meantime, this friend and -- divorced. And it was 1988, I -- I made recordings in Israel, with the Israel symp -- Philharmonic Orchestra, and we called te-each other. “Now what di -- what -- what did you do the last time?” “Oh, I# was in Israel. I went to do recording, I -- Mozart flutereet concertos.” “Oh, I know very well the Mozart flutereet concertos, because my -- my father-in-law played it very often.” “Who?” I said, “The -- The Nazi?” “Yes.” And he said, “Yes.” Uh-huh. He called Martin, a very, very, very | nice man. I said, “Martin, how is it possible to -- to -- to examine Jewish raciesm, and -- and -- and Mozart?” He answered with one word. “Deutsch.” German. So this Frank played Bach, they played Mozart, and in the meantime they killed millions. Isn’t it April 24, 2000 beautiful? Of course, it happened after the war, but the -- but I think that you -- you should examine all these problems in da -- in the -- it’s totality, and not -- not only the | margarine indecipherable} in Auschwitz, because it was bad indecipherable} in then - in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- and very little. But they -- the -- there is something more. Well, to come back to the --

  <p id="283">
   Q: When Mengele came in to do a selection, did you have a strategy for not getting selected? Did you try to --
  </p>
  <p id="284">
   A: Of course, of course, because I had to -- I had to present me as a strong man, and in the first selection, I made a mistake, because we had twice five lines, and as he came in smiling, he selected only for the gas, but then he -- he had enough, because it was too long, and -- and had -- had not enough patience, and for the five others, he took -- he -- he made the contrary, he selected for life. And I yi -- And I remained, you know, in my place, to -- si -- thinking that it was the same matter, and then I went to the -- to the selecting -- to the selected barrack.

   Q: Oh! fndeeipherable}
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   A: Ina very stupid way. And one of the Pistaspishtars is a -- was -- he was selected, and this is something else, something which you cannot reproduce, on a -- in a picture or describing, this is the -- the last days of young people waiting for the death. And there was a -- an -- an incredible ambiance, very slow, pianissimo everything. Nobody -- April 24, 2000 Nobody -- Nobody s-spoke loud. In the meantime, of course, we said yes, we will be transported, and we will make something light. But there was a b -- there was a big quantity of hi -- of prisoners, strong, who didn’t do anything at all. So, it was a same -- the same human reaction that Hungary will be an exception, that -- that it was inimaginable that they -- they choose the -- the -- the -- the -- the weak -- the weak prisoners to make something light, which means the others don’t do anything, so it -- it didn’t correspond to any logic, of course. Three tin -- days later, Mengele returns, and selects the selected, and I ra -- “Oh, you are healthy, come out.” And so Mengeles -- Mengele saved my life. So you know, so the second selection, it was more cynical, because with the second selection, plenty of -- of Polish prisoners arrived, Polish Jews from Polish ghettos, and they knew that -- the food was so bad that they all remained small, very small. And then they put I don’t know what it is, a kind of no -- I don’t know, I don’t know the n -- I don’t know what it is, so -- gymnastic, you can use it if you -- if you -- if you spring two -- two feet, three feet.

   Q: Mm-hm.

  <p id="302">
   A: So, his descriptions is goo -- are correct. And if you want -- If anybody want to understand the -- the human side of -- of the concentration camp, [“‘it’s just a cramp” George telling Katie about a cramp somewhere]Hindeeipherable} camp, then this is the -- this is the literature number one, from an absolutely honest man who by chance, is a great- a great writer, and who -- whose view is so interesting, and so diverse, and so colored. So this is -- whether -- whether -- whether “he is still a man”, or something like this is the title, se questo un uomoquestre-normale, in Italian. And I don’t know the answer. I April 24, 2000 don’t know the answer, if -- if he remained a man or not completely, or just a little bit. I | don’t -- this is your question, but I can’t answer-#.

  <p id="303">
   Q: What did you do all day? At this point in Auschwitz, are you working?
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   A: Nothing, nothing, nothing. Absolutely nothing. We -- We played mil. It’s a -- a play. We can -- We couldn’t -- Absolutely nothing. We had to stor -- stand up very early, either five or six o’clock, for no reason, and then came this so-called breakfast, which was some coffee or tea, but anyway the same taste. And we could use it to wash our face, and then waiting time, lunch came between 10 and one, and supper, approximately six o’clock. But I -- I -- I don’t want to come back, because you -- you -- you’ve heard several times how we ate, so I -- I think it -- it -- there’s no interest, to repeat it.

  </p>
  <p id="308">
   A: The number, B -- B14715. But I don’t know why in December, ’44, re -- and why not before, and why not after. I don’t know the significance, and very logical German explanation, that a couple of weeks after, we landed in Dora, which was another concentration camp in Thuringen¥-Ferian, and we became completely other numbers. So nobody cared off. Here I had a number, and I had another one here. So, don’t ask, because it is -- it is terrible, so they -- the lack of logic 1s terrible.

Meanwhile, they said that we were not religious enough, and now this is the punishment of God. So, I don’t know. I’m sure that I was in the same camp as Elie Wiesel, but we didn’t -- we didn’t know each other, and nobody knew that in this camp was somebody later noble. | So, this we didn’t know.

   Q: Was anyone who was in a position of power over you, a kapo, or an SS man, or even a Gypsy, was anyone ever kind to you? | A: No. No, and fisatyfinallyhimely relationship with these persons, human relationships couldn’t exist. Could exist between -- between other p -- other people, and I like to -- I’d like to, if you -- if you agree, I -- I like to -- to speak of a couple of people who -- who were really excellent, particularly doctors, Hungarian or German doctors. For instance, there was a hospital, which is a -- which was a barrack, of course, but in this hospital, he knew that the selection will start in the camp, and the next day in the hospital, and he told me, today you come to the hospital, you are sick, and tomorrow, I -- you are -- you'll go out. So, meanwhile, the selection, I was not available, because in the hospital. And for the April 24, 2000- the selection in the hospital, I was -- I was out.

   A: During the march, I -- in the shoes, a German prisoner, I think it was a German Communist, who -- there was a kind of -- of -- of -- not an -- not an alto, but something which is a kind of a coach, and he gave me, during the longest hour -- long hours, place in the interior of this coach, which I -- this wa -- not -- not only that I didn’t march, but I - | -- | -- I didn’t -- I -- I -- I wasn’t si -- not frozen any more. So they were excellent people, and as far -- I -- I -- I want to jump a little bit. After the liberation, Bergen- Belsen, I was together with a German Communist and two German, y -- Witness of Jehovah, who --
  </p>
  <p id="330">
   Q: Mm-hm, Jehovah’s Witness?
  </p>
  <p id="331">
   A: Jehovah’s Witness, yes. The situation was stilltelle*, thatas a writer, as Durrenmattdermaht for instance, should have written a piece. You can’t imagine German Communists, resistant number one, German Jehovah’s Witnesses, who didn’t | 4 such April 24, 2000 fight because they do -- be-because they -- they don’t fight, and a Hungarian Jew, 16 year old, and all this conversation, because they accused each other, of course, because the -- the Communist said that there is nothing, what you are doing, and they were -- they were convinced if they refuse -- refuse to say Heil, Hitler, because Heil only concerns Jesus, and not Hitler, and because they didn’t want to -- to take -- to -- to -- to take weapons in their hand, in either hand, they -- so as it was -- it -- it was not a serious resistance. They - They didn’t kill anybody, and they wouldn’t ha -- they wouldn’t have killed anybody, so it wa -- in no danger, but they have been in -- closed down, and the Hungarian Jewish - Jewish boy, 16 year old, knowing little of the world, having lost his parents, and with these three other men, there’s -- the Jehovah’s Witnesses were fantastic. You -- You -- This is something which is -- there -- which I -- I -- I really cannot forget, that in these very hard times, when we recognized after all that, what happened, and what have you -- what it lost, who is lost. And I -- I went with Villy, I think he called, Villy, one of bothpese, went out to collect blackberries. So, what a contradiction. Well, I -- I'd like to tell you about SolveigSelverg.

At the end of Auschwitz, you can read in this -- in Levi, Primo Levi, that the Germans didn’t realize that the war was in Auschwitz for -- before Auschwitz, and a British plane [indecipherable] it went around -- he wanted to April 24, 2000 | open a -- a factory, on February first.

And one week | before, I arrived from Auschwitz to FiirstengrubeFierstengrute, wich is aththe coal mine, and I don’t know why, but I arrived, and the first day I was in the mine, it was fantastic.

I didn’t -- I never her -- I n -- I never knew it because three days before, the 18", started this death march, and so I lost it completely from my -- from my life, from my life. You know, this is the same. One day I was in ams | -- and in Den HaagHague, in the Mauritshuismeretses-house, where is a fantastic painting of Rembrandt, the painter, th-the person is Homer. And suddenly arrives a Hungarian group, four persons, and apparently one who led the whole -- the whole group. And the lady asked, “Ah, could you tell me who is this man?” And he said, “Oh, very April 24, 2000 probably a --an old Jew.” And I couldn’t bring out this gentleman, this is not an old Jew, this is an old Greek, and -- and [indecipherable] these is the -- the same human problem, | something which I -- which is -- which is lost for the vee-vie -- for the life.

  <p id="361">
   A: So the march was what it -- what it was, it’s not about how the march was findecipherable} like -- I never seen such a march, other -- so -- like, this is -- this is not the word. So, the march was one of the -- of the deepest point of -- of -- of human misery, and not comparable to any other phenomenon. Perhaps in Cambodia, perhaps Pol Pot, or something like that, but in normal life I think this is -- this is -- this is really a -- a | Premicrepremier.

   Q: Speaking about the shoes, and we were talking earlier that you really wanted to see them, have you seen a pair since then?

  <p id="366">
   April 24, 2000 | A: Here not. I went to the ShoahShaw Museum in Los Angeles, but I told you. And I think that this is the comment, and the exposition of this whole thing, too smooth, too delicate for this -- for this horror, which has been represented by the shoes. So therefore, I | think that what +eu-we are doing -- what you are doing, I am doing now, is finally, this is hopeless, and th-th -- it 1s not -- because I cannot tell you -- you -- you ask what was it like. The question is -- has been made in such a way that I understand that you will -- you cannot imagine what it was. In -- In no -- I -- I -- I know -- I know no human being capable of imagining such a horror. So this is -- this is not a -- this is not a normal level, you know. So this experience is not transferable. I made this experience, and now I -- it belongs to me, and -- and I -- it is one of my -- my greatest experiences of -- of -- of -- of life. But I cannot transfer it -- it -- it -- is the -- is the film of shi -- of Schindler, cannot | be a -- a realistic film, because you cannot find 200-two hundred actors, and to -- to lock them, and let them lose the weight. So this -- you can’t -- you cannot do it. So if you can’t, the pictures you will see will be wrong, and will not correspond to the -- to the reality. So this is not feasible. Only if somebody organized a ki -- a camp, and you went into the camp, but I d -- I don’t wish you to go there, so these a -- it’s an initial contradiction in the thing, and -- and I think that what we can, we have to do to -- not to live with every day, but to think of it, to do -- to know that this is not a normal museum, this is a museum of the death, and -- and this -- the whole story is the story of the death, and the death is -- the death -- death is horrible, it’s horrible to die with 15 or fi -- 16. It’s horrible to die, to -- I -- I knew a lady whose child, I don’t know, three or four weeks old, April 24, 2000 have been -- have -- have -- have been taken away and killed, and not the lady. And the lady came back from the camp during this -- during her entire life, hi -- she lived with this -- with this dead baby. So, this is -- So this kind of atris -- of atrocities, if I tell you, and you -- you -- you write it down, somebody read it -- reads it, but it’s still a piece of paper. So this is not imaginable, you -- you are -- you are asking concrete questions, and this is okay, but as I am not -- you -- you see that I was not able to ex -- to -- to -- to speak of the ambiance of the selected, because -- because it is -- it is -- it is horrible. Imagine 200 people in a -- in America, waiting on the electric chair together. What will they say? Who would cry, who would shout? So, but this is -- this is -- it cannot happen.

   Q: I think you just said a lot.
  </p>
  <p id="368">
   A: So that’s it?
  </p>
  <p id="369">
   Q: No. I’m just saying --
  </p>
  <p id="370">
   A: -- who did it is Primo Levi, but there’s no more Primo Levi. Well, I think I could go at SIx.
  </p>
  <p id="371">
   Q: What time is it?
  </p>
  <p id="372">
   A: Hm?
  </p>
  <p id="373">
   Q: At the end of the march, how -- what kind of state were you in physically?
  </p>
  <p id="374">
   A: Ho, I cannot describe you. We have been sent to a building, completely dark, and from this building, of course by feet to the gareguar -- to the -- to the s -- railway station. Once more, | remember of the tramway in GleiwitzGlivitz, and I was very interested by this __ tramway, and the whole atmosphere, because i -- the ga -- the war was before
  </p>
  <p id="375">
   April 24, 2000 | GleiwitzGhivitz, and the people -- people wanted to go away. So it was as -- fantastic movement in the -- in the -- in the town, to -- to -- to escape, not -- not only the -- not prisoners, but normal civilians. | Q: S-So you were in GleiwitzGlwitz?
  </p>
  <p id="376">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="377">
   Q: And you’ re saying that there’s a sense that the -- the -- the -- that there’s a lot of movement, and -- and -- and really maybe that the war is winding down, or -- or going to peak, I guess.
  </p>
  <p id="378">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="379">
   Q: Yeah. D-Did you begin to start imagining that you might be liberated?
  </p>
  <p id="380">
   A: Not there. It was impossible. Of course, everybody li -- to liber -- to be liberated was a dream, but we didn’t know how. And what the Germans did, it was -- it made no sense to transport Jewish prisoners, and to lose the war. To -- To use the rail for -- to transport people somewhere, I didn’t -- I didn’t know exactly where and how, between | GleiwitzGlivitz and Dora NordhausenNorthhausen, | think his number is five -- five hours of driving, and we did it in one week, in this open -- opened, coal cars. It made no sense, so they paralyzed for one week, a train, the rails, and whatever, to transport us, and they did the same two month later to transport to Bergen-Belsen on April -- we arrive on April 10", and the British army, the 15". So it made no sense to send ou -- to send somebody from the Americans, who they -- this was the American territory, I think well April 24, 2000 we're -- where we were last time were, to the British territory. It made no sense. So what is the advantage to be liberated by the British instead of the Americans? So -- Or -- I --
  </p>
  <p id="381">
   Q: Can you describe the moment of liberation?
  </p>
  <p id="382">
   A: Yes. Th-The German there, the -- the HakenkreuzHaakenereise has been put by -- put down, but you know, I was in a very bad, then I was 4+indecipherable}in very bad health, and a couple of days are missing, so you know that I remember of the days, a couple of days are missing, because very probably I was in a kind of coma, and instead of | -- | -- -- I didn’t die, findeeipherable}a had a big chance, because on perhaps the 10" or the 11" of May, I asked a -- a ge -- a German soldier, who became prisoner in the meantime, “How about the war?” And he said, “The war? The war is finished.” And then I understood that I felt out for a -- a good couple of days.
  </p>
  <p id="383">
   Q: S-So you don’t remember the British soldiers coming in, and --
  </p>
  <p id="384">
   A: Yes, the British soldiers coming in, yes, but it happened later. The British soldiers came on April 15", the end of the war on May eighth, and the -- and for me the 10 or 11, so something is miss -- something was missing, and then I gi -- went out and met | people, they saidsays, “Oh, you are still alive.” We didn’t -- We -- We didn’t think that he -- we are alive.
  </p>
  <p id="385">
   Q: What was that like when the -- can you just describe what it was like when the British soldiers came in to Bergen-Belsen?
  </p>
  <p id="386">
   A: Yes, I think this is the HakenkreuzHaakenereise, and the fact that we realized findecipherable} that it is finished, that this was finished, but the health was bad. So the April 24, 2000 liberty was there, but the British -- not the British, nobody -- nobody knew how to handle th-this kind of -- of -- of -- of living -- living death people, so you can imagine that i -- I - if -- if you lose 50 percent of your weight, approximately, how do you want to oblige your stomach and your body to work? You couldn’t. And they gave fat and meat, and -- and plenty of things, they -- they gave what they had, but what they -- what they -- but what they di -- they didn’t, couldn’t resolve, this -- this -- the -- the -- the health situation.
  </p>
  <p id="387">
   Q: What was wrong with you?
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   A: I thi -- I think that I had typhus, I think, because the typhus is provoked by -- what’s the name of this small --
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   Q: Mosquito?
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   A: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Very small insects.
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   Q: An ant?
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   A: Hm? I -- I don’t know --
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   Q: Oh, tick.
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   A: Y -- No.
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   Q: Lice?
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   A: Yes, perhaps.
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   Q: Lice. In the hair?
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   Q: Uh-huh. April 24, 2000
  </p>
  <p id="400">
   A: Yes. And I didn’t realize, because I -- in Bergen — Dora, Bergendera-—we were working -- I was really working on the weapon miracle of Hitler, the Vl Fee — V2¥Vee ene-vee-tywe. And I -- I wore these glass bands, glass tapes, and of course i-it provoked my -- my [indecipherable}+ve-were. And I didn’t -- I didn’t realize that the position between the glass and the -- and the insects. It was horrible. I -- Imagine one sh -- one shirt you had 200 - 300. Well -- Well, so I think we could continue this conversation eternally. I think the most important thing is that I don’t know if the Jewish are really the chosen people, maybe. If it is -- If it is so, our experience concerns the huma -- hu -- the entire humanity. This is not only a Jewish problem, because people are very inventive, and new methods of killing will arrive. And I think that -- that we cannot be -- we cannot | agree with Serge KlarsfeldKtassfeld, you know him, a very important journalist, and -- and especially of Holocaust and the -- and war criminals. I met him once in the air -- the | air -- at the airport, and I told him who I was, that I was also in a concentration camp, etcetera, and I see -- and I ask him, what do you think, w-wouldn’t it be better to -- to try to share this experience with other people having the same conditions, or similar conditions? And he said, “They have to find th-the right solution. This is our problem now.” And I think not -- I don’t think that is our problem. I think that is of course our -- our problem, but if such a horror arrives to a -- to a people, and you see that something similar, and more cynical arrived in Cambodia when the -- the head of the state started to kill his own population, and -- and you -- we -- we see everywhere where we -- in hoot -- in Bu-Burundi, and the hoot -- Tutsies and Hutus and -- and the -- Kosovo, and April 24, 2000 whatever. So I think that this experience should be -- must be strong enough to go over -- to let understand by other people, that these experience should serve to somehow -- somehow to immunize hum -- huma -- the whole humanity, to -- to try to think before they -- they s -- they start such horrors. I think this is -- this must be the message of | everybody having survived this -- findecipherable}this horrible period of ya -- of -- of human history. Thank you very much, thank you for your patience.
