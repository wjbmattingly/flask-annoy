   Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, conducted by Peggy Frankston, with Andre, Lucie and Joyce, who were born Zalc. All brother — a brother and two sisters, and it’s going to be — and it’s on July 23", 2009, in New York City, and it’s a continuation of the three separate interviews that were just done, talking about wartime experiences, and perhaps some of the experiences after the war, or some experiences before the war. So, I’d like to start with some of the things that you know about your parents.
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   A: Yeah, so, my mother, she came from a family living in — in Latvia, and — not in Riga, she was Ventspila(ph). That’s a different city, it’s a ha-harbor in Latvia. And she had two brothers, and t-two sisters. And they owned a — a farm of cattle, a cattle farm up there. But — and of course in Latvia there was a — a certain amount of Jewish population. And that way Latvia also was a — belonged to Russia, but before it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany. And the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian occupation, or beca — the Russian got the — got the territory. And she — her — they were Selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere. But then the — the tsar of Russia had a brother and his name was Peter. And when they went — they went in war with Germany, a — a [indecipherable] there were — he — he was afraid of the Jewish population because in those days the Jews were friendly with the Germans, July 23, 2009 and they spoke Yiddish, which 1s an — an old German. It’s a dialect of Germany from — from 500 years ago. So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia, they decided to — to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the [-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea, by Azrahan(ph), by Baku, Azrahan(ph). And they were sent there. And up there they — they started a new life, with different businesses to survive. And the gr — the grandfather, my mother’s father started because there — up there is a lot of fish. The — the caviar comes from there, and the — and the best fish. And the oils from the whales, too, which was like, very important in those days. So he start the factory of smoking fish, and he was very successful with that because in those days, in the first World War, the Russian army had no C-rations like today, and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a piece of bread. That was the food of the Russian soldier. And — and he couldn’t produce enough smoked fish for the government, so we’re — the government wanted they should produce more fish, they’re working day and night. So he complained about it. So they told him, don’t worry about it, 1f you’re short of labor, we give you workers. So they gave him Turkish prisoners and German prisoners and Austrian prisoners from the first World War, and they used to work in the factory helping to smoke the fish. And — and two prisoners fell in love with my aunts, and they married my aunts, and when the revolution of Russia started, the war with the July 23, 2009 Germans and Russians stopped, because the Germans made the Russian revolution, I don’t know if you know that, yeah. Because they got Lenin in Switzerland, and they gave him money and they send him back to Russia to make the revolution. And when they made the revolution, the war stopped. So those — those two prisoners took their wives with them to Germany, and then went to United States. And one uncle — an aunt went to Belgium. And my mother, she was young and she wasn’t married, so she stayed with — with her folks, and the two brothers went to the Russian army. And after the war, my mother was the only daughter home with the — with the two brothers. They went back to Latvia from Azrahan(ph). But the parents died in Azrahan(ph). They got — what’s that disease? The fever — L: Typhoid?
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   A: Huh? L: Typhoid?
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   A: Typhoid. They got typhoid, and they died from that disease. Typhus, that’s called, and a — typhoid, yeah, in English. So they died from that disease, so my mother became an orphan. So the Russians go — the Russian government gave a visa, aS was already after the revolution, b-because she was an orphan, they gave a visa to go to her sister’s. One lived in the States and one lived in Belgium. So she went to Belgium to go to the States, and by going to Belgium, she stayed by that July 23, 2009 other sister and she married my father. And that’s — that’s the wa — we were born in Belgium from that wedding, and — L: And we had —
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   A: — my sister Joyce was born in France during the wartime, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q: Where was your father from?
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   A: My father was Polish, from Lodz, Lédz. I mean, he came to Belgium too, but he didn’t had his birth certificate from Poland, he couldn’t get the birth certificate, he had to go back to Poland to serve in the reserve. In Poland, after the — after the — being in the army, he has to be four or five years in the reserve. So h-he — he couldn’t go back there because he was married, he had no way of going back there. So he couldn’t get married officially in Belgium, so he was just married by the Jewish law, yeah. So — L: But he was from Lodz.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: He was from L6dzZ, yeah, but he served in the Polish army in the war with Pilsudski. That’s the Germa — the Polish general who freed Poland from the Russians, and Poland invaded Ukraine — Kiev, Poland took Kiev. But after that, the Polish lost the war, and the Russians came all the way to the capital of Poland. And things got very bad in Poland, and so he left Poland and he came to Belgium July 23, 2009 L: Belgium.
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   A: And he didn’t serve in —
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q: Is that why your name is Umal(ph) on your — L: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   A: Yeah, and that’s why in Belgium, I didn’t have my father’s name, I was named Umal(ph) after my mother. And being that I was under my mother’s name, I became a Belgium citizen automatically, because he came from — from foreign por — parents in Belgium, he didn’t had the Belgium nationality, he had to go, he had to serve in the Belgium army to become a Belgium. So I was a Belgium automatically, I — in this coun — I am consi — I was considered the son of the King Albert, King Albert, I was his son. I never seen him myself. L: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   Q: Lucie, you remember what it was like arriving in France, you — what — going to the different camps? L: Well, we were on a train going to France, and | think a bomb fell on the train.
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   A: About two weeks. L: And it took us a long time, and we had to get off the train to go to the bathroom and all that. And when the bomb fell on the train, it divided the train in two, and July 23, 2009 part of the train was left behind, and we were lucky, our train went on. And that’s how we got to other station.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: To the south of France. L: And that’s — it’s unbelievable, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="14">

  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: When you went to the first camp, were you all together, or were you separated? L: I think we were to —
  </p>

L: I don’t — I remember they made a party, and they gave us some food, and that was very joyous, there was music and everything, but I think that was around the holidays, and that’s when I remember. I even remember smuggling out a little piece of bread in my underwear for my mother, because she always saved everything for US.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: And — and in camp too, there was certain rumors going around that if you volunteer to go to work in Germany, you get more food, and you get better things, and a lot of people volunteered for it. I don’t know if they went — L: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="30">

  <p id="67">

And my mother had a lot of Jewish — like a Jewish book, and a lot of Jewish things that she put — do you know what a [indecipherable] 1s?
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: The what? L: A [indecipherable]. J: It’s feathers. It’s a feather blanket. L: It’s like a feather blanket, she opened up the seam and put a lot of things in there
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: She hide a lot of things in there, yeah. L: — so they wouldn’t find it. And the —
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   A: The pictures from our family and everything. She had pictures from her brothers in the Russian army. J: That’s how we got everything.
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: She — she put all that stuff in there and the — the Germans came in, but they — they —th-th-they never dreamed of opening up the thing, you know. L: And also, she threw a lot of things away in these public bathrooms, you know, where you throw things that — like in that movie, what’s that movie where that little kid hid in there?
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   A: The — the public toilet? July 23, 2009 L: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Yeah. See, in France, in that town, there wasn’t — we had toilets, you know, where we lived. But a lot of houses had no toilets and in the morning they used to come to the public toilet. They had like — at night they used to go in pots, like a bucket, and in the morning they used to come to public toilet, empty everything in there. The public toilet was very important — L: Very rural.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   A: — because there wasn’t — a lot of houses had no public toilets in France. In that town where we lived [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   Q: Okay, what do you want to say? J: She also hid her wedding certificate, and a few — and my father’s tallis in his coat, in the lining of his coat. Now I had — they found that.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   Q: Was she — your — your —
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   A: We were all surrounded by Germans you know. L: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: The Germans in Oradour-sur-Glane in France, they put all the population to church, and they burned them all, and they machine-gunned everything. And we were like minutes away from something like that, too, because the Germans wanted July 23, 2009 to get even for their train, because the train went to Italy, used to carry German troops, ammunition. And used to carry women, who went to see their husbands in Italy. And the women who went to see their husbands in Italy brought their babies in there, and when the train derailed, they all got killed. And so wa-was a — the Germans wanted to get even with that, but they were a little bit afraid when the saw the French ta — ta — to do crazy things, because there was too ma — too much sa — resistance, too much resistance in the woods, and they know if they do something very bad, they’re going to pay for it in fra — in the south of France, because in the — in the mountains, they cut off the — the roads, and they — they would have killed a lot of German. L: Yeah, so that’s about it, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   Q: Your father was in the resistance?
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   A: Yeah. L: I—I knew he were — he was in the woods. Whenever the Germans would come in town, he would be in the woods, but I didn’t know what he — what exactly for sure.
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   Q: But — J: But he knows. July 23, 2009 L: But he knows. J: But he knows.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   Q: But he was working as a — a lumberjack, he was cutting —
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   A: A lumberjack, he was cutting trees.
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   Q: — trees. L: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: But he — was he with other people who were Jewish, or was he with other resistance fighters, or was he part of a— a— a work brigade?
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: No, he was — he was — the resistance were 1n the woods, and they used to hide by the lumberjacks, you — in the — 1n the — in the woods, where you hide the woods, where the pieces, where you cut the woods, they used to hide their weapons, yeah. And they used to go out to derail trains. But there wasn’t mentioned nothing, you know. I used to say to them, how you got so many sardines? Boxes full of sardines from Portugal. In those days one little can of sardines was like a hundred dollars, you could sell it for a hundred dollars, nobody had it. And he didn’t say, he say, oh we got it, we got it, know. And then I find out that the — by the train, the derailment of the train they got all this stuff. And their weapons too, came from the trains. They used to have German weapons, grenades, come off from the trains they used July 23, 2009 to derail. To derail a train was very easy, they didn’t derail 1t with dynamite. They used to unscrew the — the rail, and the train used to come, and go down in a — ina — off the mountain, know, in a ravine, know, and then that was it, know.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: Did the people in Tresse know that you were Jewish, apart from the woman who help [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Yeah, yes, some people knew we were Jewish, yeah. J: ’'m sure they knew. I’m sure they knew. L: Yeah. But we were lucky, they didn’t stamp Juif on our passport, which saved our life.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   A: Yeah, yeah. The — the newspapers say that you got to go to the police and ask to — the passport to be stamped. So my mother sent me to the police with the passport. So the — the guy in charge of the police, he say go home, don’t come to me no more. L: Yeah, there were — we were lucky, that’s — it’s all luck.
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: Yeah, I [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: And when you went to school —
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: We didn’t realize that we were so da — it was so dangerous at times.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: You knew you were different, that you were foreigners, but did they know that you were Jewish in the public school? L: I don’t know, I don’t know. July 23, 2009
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: In school, in school, th-th-they knew, but they — they couldn’t speak German, the French, that was the — because one French teacher, he — he — you cou — I could see in his eye the hate, eh? I could see in his eye when he talked to me that he — he — that he hated me, you know, it’s easy to see, y-you understand me? Yeah. And the Germans came when they took too long, during the war, they took too long, the Germans. And when they came, they came to Tresse, when they took too long, then they came from Stalingrad, the German troops. And they needed to buy paint and — and screwdrivers, and nails. So the — they asked the principal if somebody speak German here. He said, maybe there’s a Belgium kid, meaning me, he speaks German. So this principal told the — this teacher told the principal, take the guy, send him with the Germans to translate, to — to f— to buy things for th — to speak French for them. So I went with them. So the Germans are translate, so I said to the Germans, why do you need so many — so many things? He says, we going back to Russia, there’s nothing there in Russia. There’s no nails, there’s no hammers, there’s no screwdriver. He bought a lot of tools. So the next day a-again, he came to school and I went with him, and the German officers. So the — the third day, the third day he said to me — the — the guy in charge of the German troops, he must have been a brigadier general or something, he says, he would like to meet you, because we told him we have a kid who speaks German for us. Would you like to July 23, 2009 meet him? I said, yeah, if he wants to meet me, I mean. So I went with him to the base. In the wood they had the tent. And they had all the German officers in that tent. And outside were the trucks and the tents and everything. So I went in the tents with them, and the — the guy in charge there, I don’t know, he was a big German officer, they all clapped their heels for him. I don’t who he was. L: Well —
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   A: S-So he says to me, sit down, have some tea. I have no coffee, I give you tea. So he gave me some cake and tea.
