   A: It it depends. I can't tell you general, because everybody every family has their Shabbat. It was very, very hard to keep Shabbat, first of all. The you know, the Soviet then installed a week of five five days of work. The sixth day is a a rest day. So it was it it didn't it wasn't a Shabbas, to say to say a a Jewish Shabbas. And that's what they did. Because they didn't want to to the religion, it wasn't a Shabbas. It wasn't lahaudil, a Sunday. No religion. This this week, it is it is Thursday, the other week it was Friday, the other week it was Monday. You see? But the families that still hold the religion, it was very, very hard. If somebody didn't come to do work, he was fired and he you looked for all kinds of how to how to keep a little bit of Shabbas, to not to forget that there is a Shabbas. But in in my house, for example, it was it was Shabbas was Shabbas. My father was a shochet, bet better, or worse, in Parnasa, in this, but Shabbas was Shabbas. We were eating all together, the family was here. But it was always under very, very amyrid (ph) afraid. Because every every minute, you can have a knock in the door and that who, what are you doing? And they take you and you are in Siberian. You see? But the Shabbas, in my house, what I remember, from from my childre chil it was very nice. The family we were not a big family, four kids, father and mother. Shabbas was Shabbas. A kiddish and this. And still it was still stilla a synagogue. And we lived in the synagogue. We lived in in synagogue there. It it it 1t was my father, officially, says that he was the the keeper. He was a a chamber, a guardian, of the of the building. No. But he was a shochet. He was a shochet. Das. And officially he was. And that's all. And I tell you what was when I was twe twe twe seven seven eight years we come in this war in this fifth place, in fifth place from my from my from my childhood. It was called Verones. That in central Russia, one of the places that was very, very in the second world second world war it was big fights there; very, very big fights. Verones, Kursk, Netszkeiv, Moscow. Then Verones in the center, you see? There we were. And that was, for us for us was a Shabbas, like their Shabbas. My father was learning with me, to write and to read to read in Russian; this I learned by myself, I learned this. You see?

  </p>
  <p id="35">
   Q: But everything worked underground?

  <p id="36">
   A: Okay. In in in this time, in in in Verones, where we were, when I was eight years old, about eight years, then was there a few older older young young young bochurim, young young people, and they were learning in the shul underground. Because the the yeshiva was already closed. It was after '27 Lubavitcha Rebbe was chased out from RussiA: He was arrested and this, and all yeshivas were closed. No no yeshivas.

And it was then three bochurim and a and two younger one, five, ten, and they were changing. And one month somebody learned with me, the other month another one. And it was going till I was 12 years old. But 12 years old it was already impossible, because we were not not going in the public schools and everybody, why the kids are not going in public school? It was very, very dangerous. If the if the the government would would know. You don't want to to learn your kids communism with all these things? So I I my my parents sent me out from my house.

So it was a few young boys here, a few young boys here. In this time it was already older. It was about 19 years, something like this. We didn't got directly a teacher. Was sitting by ourself learning a little bit, private houses and this. And I remember, it was it's a village in GeorgiA: In this moment it's a a really Jewish village. It got one one payen one not not Jewish family that left there. But was, for Shabbas, everything what you needed, he was he knew already every family, every this. And it was coming and putting the the warm to to warm the house with these things. And I remember that that in the central central central street, 1t was not not very big, maybe maybe a kilometer and a half, something like this, somebody on a horse was going and a and was screaming lauda (ph) okay, the war is ended. That's that what das. And it was already a yontif. Everybody went out from the houses and was singing, laughing and this. The world is das. All Micatavda that that's the word ina ina ina Saccatwel (ph), in Georgian. Oh Micatavda, in a horse, he was going on the whole in the whole street and announcing it. And that was das.

And even even till '53, when Stalin, Stalin was dead, they said it was even worse. Because he was a maniac and he started again and again and again to exterminate all whatever it took. He thought that it's against him. And that's what we heard already when we were out. Because it it it didn't took a long time, a few time till they started again back.

One month we stayed in ViennA: Before the American UNRAA, that's the UN the UNRRA, they put every people in another another DP loggers, DP camps. So we wrote a letter to the Lubavitcha Rebbe. And the Lubavitcha Rebbe thought before before the war it was a question that my family has to go to AustraliA: So, the Lubavitcha Rebbe, in the first letter, where he good wishes for coming out from Russia and escaping Russia and this. And he said, your family, that were with you in contact from Australia is still there. And it's worthful to start again about papers to go to AustraliA: Okay.

Now, in the first time, when I wrote to the Rebbe that I that the Raul Goradesky asked me to help him in the office, in the Lubavitch Rebbe's office, Rabbi answered me a very nice letter, okay, I was a bucher of over 20 years old, a yingle. The Rabbi told me, yeah, you have to help him, HaShem would help you, mit us. When they come, I write the Rebbe, now the yeshiva is here and I would like to go back to the yeshivA: And the Rebbe answered me, a kotzin letter, not not a longer letter like before, the whole the whole goal of learning Torah with Talmud is to know how to turn to do a good thing for another Yid. You have to work to help in the office that's all and HaShem will help you. And there.

   A: That's in Paris and around Paris. And synagogues for Lubavitch, special synagogues in towns. It all started from our office, a round little office. It was printed things mit us coming here. As I say, that is in the City of Vedicu, very known Yiddish and das. And, as I told you, here is here it says underground religious academy underground religious academy in the City of Vedicu. And here is no no date. No date. Nothing down here. Here we are the the students, to say say like this. Here I am. This is Iam here. And I was in this time, I was the youngest one of this whole group. And when this that was taking this photograph, I was I was teves 13 years and three months. Thirteen years and three months. And it was in December, 1937. We were sitting in a little shul, in a little shul. That's the guardian of the shul. We were sitting in the basement, but not a basement. It's a cave. We were sitting all together with our teacher. That's our teacher. He came

  <p id="226">
   from BelarusiA: And he knew everybody knew that this very, very dangerous to learn with kids, when this Soviet government has to learn communism. And that's his contribution. Contribution. But that was the goal of of giving over to the coming generation. And that was the the mission with the Lubavitcha Rebbe gave when a when he left Russia: Not to leave the religion to go out. And it has to go do without thinking about themself. That's in in the guardian. That's that's this one is now in an old age home here in Brooklyn. This one is down in Brooklyn still. And and that's all what's what's what's left from this from this photography. And that's it.

  </p>
  <p id="233">
   Q: Now, Mr. Wilschanski, one last question. And so much of your experience during the war was around this group of people, a very, very important story for you. And just taking from that and the in the larger experience, what in in your your sense, in your spirit, what message would you want to pass on to the younger generation in that kind of Hashkafic message to future generations, what happened to you and your family, what are the if I can put it in that way, what are the lessons from your experience?
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   A: I see that the one thing that helped us to go through all this difficult times, for us, us us youths, us kids, and then with us young boys, and later, 1s because we were very, very strong with the way that the older generation made it for us. All the prescriptions, I say, the terror, the rebbeshte, the Rebbe, Lubavitcha Rebbe, was always holding us in das inthe in the hardest times. It was the only the only wish, that once it will come that we can be together and practice our religion openly without any persecutions, without any difficulties. And that's it. That's what holded us. And when you we came in a free land. It's much difficult more difficult than it was there to see you. Because you you you know how the Talmud say, the eyes see and the heart want it. There you you know that you can't go left or right. You have to go in the right way, in the middle way. And that has the younger generation generation to look and to learn from the older ones. We learned this from before us. Say later I'm not too much learn from us but still, they can look it was every generation has to look for the other. And, most of all, we have we have where to go. We have an open way, a very, very wide way and a good way. And that what holded us for the thousands of years and that's what hold us now. And that's the biggest miracle in the world. The Rabbi gezucht, you wanna make revenge, the Yiddish word from Hitler, go in the Jewish in Jewish way; that will be the biggest vengeance, zestas (ph), against Hitler, a yemach shemo v'zechrai. I have a an anichle. And he's now in in Milana, in das. And there in Milana a family is a man and a wife and an aunt. That's a family. Not us. And he, Baruch HaShem, have four kinderlach. Then maybe he got three. And he come in tram train. Come here, kinderlach. No, tati, tati, tati, tati. In Italiano, "Lady, nu, that's all what you have? That's it? Yes? And you you plan to have more"? "Yeah." "How much? How much?" Das. "Six million," he told her. And that's all your your fault. Yiddin doffin nissin, doffin gein in de richten de vag. And that will be the biggest, the biggest revenge against our enemies. And, Zecher, with HaShem help, that we will be the victorious. We will das, das.
