   A: I was run over by a bus. There was a boy that had some kind of a sickness that if he touched you, you caught that sickness. So, not knowing the language, I knew the boy, and he came — he tried to touch me and I turned around to run away from him and a bus hit me. And over there, they didn’t call for an ambulance or anything, so they called my father and he picked me up. We live near the emergency hospital and he took me to the emergency hospital. And the bus ran me over on my groin, on the — on my right side, and 35 years later, I experienced problems on my right hand, and the doctors here said that it came from that -- that he could show up many, many years later.

  </p>
  <p id="108">

  </p>
  <p id="111">

  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: So what did your family do to cope with the situation?
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: They had to go shopping a few days a week into Havana to be able to get some kosher food and the only thing we were able to get near the house was like bread or butter, but otherwise if we had to — need any meats or anything, we had to go to Havana because there was no refrigeration. It was an icebox and there was no way to keep anything.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: What was it like for your family in this new culture, not just with respect to religion, but with respect to the culture as oppose to what you had been use to in Poland. Were the problems adjusting to life in Cuba?
  </p>
  <p id="127">
   A: There was a problem adjusting because it was also that we knew we were not liked there, though some of the neighbors were nice, but we were not liked as Jews, and we were also not secure there. So we knew it was also temporary stay — hoping that sooner than later we would be able to come to this country.
  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: So did you experience anti-Semitism in Cuba? Can you explain?
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: Yes, we did, because of the way they use to talk to us, especially as children, and kids here at home — about Jewish kids — so they use to come home and express it to us and we tried to get away from them, not even to answer them.
  </p>
  <p id="130">

  </p>
  <p id="131">

  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: Were you able to get a religious education in Cuba?

  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: Did your parents keep in touch with family and friends back in Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="135">

  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: But before the war started, do you remember some of the news from Poland in the time period from °37 to °39?

  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: Do you remember hearing that Germany had attacked Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="139">

  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: No, we didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: What language did you speak inside your home?
  </p>
  <p id="143">

  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: How was the war taught in schools — in Cuba during the actual war period?
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: We weren’t told too much about it, because we were in a Catholic country, and they didn’t talk too much about it. Especially, they were afraid the Jewish kids would pick up too much.
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   Q: What was positioned of the population of Cuba just a general population. What were their views on the conflict in Europe?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="150">
   Q: Do you remember seeing any news reels, or newspapers, or hearing the radio?
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   A: Oh, yeah. There was always — there was always a Yiddish paper in the house, because that’s what my parents read and the radio use to always be on and they use to try and pick up the Yiddish stations there to hear what’s going on with the war and everything
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: Can you remember anything from that time period?
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: No, I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: Who were your friends when you were in Cuba?
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: We had just a couple of friends, not too many because they were — a lot of them were ___, and my parents always wanted us to have Jewish friends, even though some of them were very nice. But, still we wanted to associate with Jewish kids.
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: There were other — you said there were other people who like you who had come to Cuba?
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: Can you tell me from where those other people came, do you remember’?
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: They came — a lot of them came from our home town and they came to Cuba with the same idea. Now, some of them, when they were able to let their kids come to the States, they sent them back themselves. My parents didn’t want to send us by ourselves. Then if we can’t go, then none of us
  </p>
  <p id="160">

  <p id="165">
   A: The war was over in May of ’45, and not only was that a big day, but my uncle that took us to Cuba, and my brother, got married that day.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: Tell me what was going on in your life on — on that day or in that week besides your uncle’s wedding, but with you. What was happening to you, and what were your thoughts and reactions?
  </p>
  <p id="167">

  </p>
  <p id="168">

  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: Did your parents have any idea what was truly happening in Europe?
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: Well, they knew they didn’t want us kids dead, because not only did they hear it, they read it in the papers, but whatever they heard from the family writing, they knew.
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   Q: What attempts were made by your parents to find relatives or friends after the war was over?

  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: Can you remember when you started hearing the truth about what had happened in Europe?
  </p>
  <p id="175">
   A: It was after the war and I was already a little bit older, then we really started realizing what was happening, and about killing the Jews and about how we actually struggled on what they did to us and that’s why we were persecuted running from place to place, and we just couldn’t wait to be able to come to this country. Hopefully it would have been a better life than what we had in Cuba.
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Did you have any — do you have any good memories of life in Cuba?
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   A: Not that much, no, because we were persecuted there, too. We knew that it was a Catholic country, and they didn’t like us much. There were a few neighbors that were nice, but in majority of them, we knew that we were there temporarily. It was either there or someplace else if we couldn’t come to this country.
  </p>
  <p id="178">

  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: Why did you want to work as a volunteer for the Holocaust Museum?
  </p>
  <p id="215">

  </p>
  <p id="216">
   Q: What have you, with your background and personal experience, brought to the museum?
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Well, talking to some people, you bring up some ideas and you remember some things, and it broadens your — your way of life. It 1s a thing that I enjoy. It’s sad, but I enjoy it.
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: What are some of the reactions that you get from people when you tell them you went from Poland to Cuba?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: What have you personally gotten from the volunteer work that you do at the museum?

   Q: Can you share with me any special moments that you’ve had working at the museum?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Well, what to hear from people that come down. Some of them cannot real -- cannot visualize that those things that they see upstairs actually happened. And that one person can do so much trouble for the whole world.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Can you think of any specific incidents that touched you and moved you since you started working at the museum?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Well, there are many of them from reactions from people and children. But, right now, I cannot bring 1t up in my mind exactly what had been said. Now, there was a number of Negro children that they just come down — they just cannot imagine that there were white people that were persecuted. They thought they were the only ones, and they just cannot realize it.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: In you time, in this country, did you ever experience any anti-Semitism -- in the United States?

  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: I’m going to pause now, and turn over the tape -- just one moment. This is tape one, side B. We are interviewing Goldie Gendelmen. When you are settled in this country, did you and your parents ever stop and reflect about what had happened to the Jewish community in Poland and all that you not being in Poland or able to miss or avoid?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: Well, by the grace of God we missed it, and we are alive today. Otherwise, we might not had a made it either just like the other -- the rest of the six million Jews that got killed. So, it was a wonderful thing that we left. We struggled in Cuba, but it was wonderful. It paid off.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: Is there anything that you’d like to add that I didn’t ask you, you’d like to mention now?
  </p>

  <p id="236">
   Q: Have you ever been back to Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: Never did, because I wouldn’t recognize anything, and there’s probably nothing there to recognize, hearing from people that have gone back. Now, I have a few landslides here, went back several years ago, and their much older than me — well, when I say much older, I mean 15 years older, and they couldn’t recognize anything. They left like a year or two before me, and they couldn’t recognize it, so I definitely wouldn’t
  </p>
  <p id="238">

   A: Absolutely
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Can you explain?
  </p>
  <p id="241">

  </p>
  <p id="245">

  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: Is there anything you’d like to add before we conclude today?
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: We are — we are glad we are in this country, it’s a wonderful country and so for its good and we haven’t seen too much anti-Semitism. We hear about it, but we, ourselves, haven’t gotten it — I can’t think of the word I want to use, but haven’t come across it, and hopefully we won’t and my grandchildren won’t either.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Do you ever speak to any groups of people? Perhaps, children, students that came into the museum, who are of the Hispanic background?
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: If they ask me, if they come over to the desk, and they ask me, I do speak to them, children or grownups, I do, if they ask me questions, but I don’t approach them, unless they come over to our desk.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: Any final reflections on what the war years were like in Cuba, anything — has anything come to your mind since we started the interview that you would like to add?
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: Well, as far as Cuba, it was a beautiful country, but we knew that we were never secure over there. It was a temporary, it was a stop off and it ended up being 11 years over there, and we really couldn’t wait for the day to live, hopefully that 1t would of been a better life in United States, because we didn’t know what to expect.
