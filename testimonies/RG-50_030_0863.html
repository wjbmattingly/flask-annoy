   Q: Okay. Tell me — tell me a little bit about your family. What were your father’s na — what was your father’s name, and your mother’s name?
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: My father’s name is Julius Tamar, my mother is Pauline Hutterer Tamar. My father was a physician, and he practiced in Vienna. He graduated from University of Vienna Medical School. But both my parents were originally from Poland, which explains a little bit why my brother and I had to come separately, because we were Viennese born, which was one quota system. Polish born was a whole different quota system.

  <p id="14">
   Q: We'll get there. We’ ll —

  <p id="24">
   Q: What we’re going to start with though is, rather than the trip to the United States, I want to find out as much as I can about the years before then.
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: Okay.
  </p>

  <p id="37">
   A: What part of Poland? That — it was more than one town, but the one that my mother was from, and talked about the most was, if I pronounce this, Przemystl.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: Yes, she did. She had two brothers, one sister. My father had brothers and sisters. I know less about his family than I do about my mother’s, because she talked more —
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: — you know, about her history.
  </p>

   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: There was one surviving member of my mother’s family, my cousin George, who at that time was Ludzic(ph) Saltman(ph), who was interviewed by the museum, and wrote a book, and you know, it — it’s easy to research him. He went through camps from the time he was 12 to the time he was 17.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Oh my.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: And when my mother heard that he had survived, of course, you know, she brought him over. On my father’s side, his brother survived, because he went into Russia with the Red Army.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: But his wife and 18 month old baby did not. The baby was lost, because apparently they had arranged with Christian neighbors to take the baby, and could never find the neighbors, never found the baby. So, big question mark.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Oh.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: And he would have been too young to know his name or background, if he had survived.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: But those were the only survivors of what were rather large families.

  <p id="63">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: And it also illustrates just how much on the edge your situation was. That is, your parents’ situation and your own, how close your nuclear family was to the same fate.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: Oh, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: My cousin George’s family and mine had many, many similarities, and it could have — George’s story could have been my story, and his — you know. I mean it did — we were the — the same type of people, the same type of family, and th — it’s just fate.

   A: I do remember the Nazis coming in.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: I remember my father and brother, who was nine at the time, and my mother too, of course, avidly listening to the radio and Hitler shouting, but I didn’t necessarily understand what he said, I just knew he was a bad man, shouting all the time. On Kristallnacht, the morning after, my father took me for a walk, and we saw the broken glass, and the broken store windows, and I knew it was very sad, but I did not entirely understand what had happened. But I do want to tell you something about Kristallnacht, because —
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: Yeah, do tell me.
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: — it was — you know, they said it was a spontaneous outpouring of rage, and that is simply not true, it was preplanned. My father had a patient, we don’t know who it was, my father never knew, who was apparently very high up in the Nazi party. And very often a Nazi had a favor due. And the day before Kristallnacht, th-the day before, my father got an anonymous phone call that said, stay at home, you and your wife, don’t leave the apartment tomorrow. Stay at home.

  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: —he, you know, paid attention to it.

   A: I mean, it —
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: It tells you, yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: Yeah.

   Q: But did you also have a sense of fear, or — or not?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: I did. Not all the time, and not in terms of broken shop windows. Where my sense of fear showed itself — and I don’t remember any other incidents where I was really afraid, because I was very secure in my family, and I was very young. My mother sent me to the bakery, which was in our building, so it wasn’t very far for me to go, to pick up some bread, and I went, and there was a soldier with the big, black boots, and I forgot about asking for the bread, and I ran home. And my mother asked me what had happened, I said there was a Nazi soldier and I was afraid he was going to arrest me, so I ran home.

   A: — everything I’m telling you is a little bit mixed.
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Well, [—I-—I appreciate that you’re making those — those comments, because — because it’s important. It’s important for us to realize when someone Is relating an episode, how much of it is direct memory, and how much of it can be influenced by what you’re told.
  </p>

   A: Right. The direct memories, I remember feeling afraid and running home.

   A: — if not the religion.
  </p>
  <p id="144">

   A: He was nine years old, and he rose to the occasion of taking care of me as if he was an adult. And what saved me from the emotional trauma was that he became my mother, my father, my hero. And he really was — took w-way beyond a nine year old.

   A: —I wa—I was —I was with family. Years later I met some people who had been on the ship. You may know that there was a conference in 2002 in Chicago of 1,000 children who’d come unaccompanied, and I went to that, and some of the 50 children were there. I’m digressing now, but —

   Q: It’s okay — it’s okay, we can do that.
  </p>
  <p id="339">
   A: My three children went with me, because they thought it would be emotionally horrendous for me. Actually, when we got there, it was very trrumphant.

   Q: Was it?

  <p id="343">
   A: So I met other people who’d been on the ship with me, and one of them was a lady named Helga Milgram(ph), who I serd — unfortunately has since passed away, and she remembered me. I was the baby of the group, so I was more noticeable, and she was maybe nine or 10, and she and a bunch of other eight, nine, 10 year old little girls sort of took over caring for me, and you know, being extra nice to me, and when we talked about it later she said she was working through her own pain by, you know, giving to me. And I didn’t remember it clearly until I met her.

   A: And — and the memory came back to me. I — I didn’t remember the faces, or names, but I did know that on board ship all these older girls, you know, were very nice to me, and favored me. I asked her if she remembered my brother, and she said her only memory of my brother was, he was this hand —
  </p>
  <p id="346">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   A: — that I was forever holding. My brother wrote home to my parents that sometimes I really embarrassed him because sometimes I didn’t see him, and I had a panic attack and I cried, where’s Henry, where’s — or Heinzie(ph) at that —
  </p>
  <p id="348">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="349">
   A: Where’s Heinzie(ph), where’s Heinzie(ph)? And maybe he was going to the bathroom, and people were calling him, your sister needs you, she just wants you. So he — he wrote home that sometimes it was embarrassing. In terms of taking care of me, as a little girl I tended to be carsick on long trips. When we went to Texas, my memory that I don’t think was by car, I think it was by bus, I’m not a hundred percent sure, but he did write to my mother, and I had seen the letters at one time or another, that the whole way, he told me stories so that I would forget about being carsick.

   A: Well, you know, it was a — at that time in Vienna, there was a lot of talk about getting a visa, getting an affidavit. We knew no one in the United States at all. It was part of family conversation. We wound up getting, I think, the affidavit from a comparative stranger, yes. Actually somebody — a Christian who worked for Sears Roebuck. A distant relative of my mother’s couldn’t do an affidavit because he — he wasn’t well positioned enough, he wasn’t making enough money.

   A: There was a young woman, I think quite young, from Chicago, an American, traveling from Germany with her birds. She went by ship because she ha — she was bringing birds home. She was an American, but she had lived in Germany for a while. One day on deck I was swamped by a wave, and my leggings, or whatever I wore, were soaked, and I was just standing there by myself helplessly, and I didn’t know what to do. And this young woman saw me, and took me to her stateroom, and got me out of my wet leggings and gave me something dry to wear. And I remember a stateroom full of colorful birds. Now, this is a four year old’s memory. It’s perfectly possible that there were three birds. I Just remember all these birds, ma —I have no idea. And I believe she spoke German, so — because she had lived in Germany, so we communicated easily. And now here’s the mystery.

I know I spent time there, and I do know I slept there at least once, and that it wasn’t my imagination because she sent a letter to my mother, she got my mother’s address. She put me to sleep, and she says, sweet dreams, and I said, I’m going to dream about my mother. And she wrote that to my mother. So that clarifies that I really did sleep in her stateroom.

   A: — but they needed a place for these kids to go. And they couldn’t publicize us that much, because the idea of 50 Jewish children being brought to the States wasn’t that popular. So they had to do things a little quietly. So on one hand they needed foster care for us, but it was difficult for them. And when people kept wanting my brother, they thought it might be harder to place two children, and they were going to separate us. And that is when my brother came into his full nine year old powers, and absolutely refused, and you know, then when someone wanted to take him, like if I don’t go with my sister, I’m going to make your life miserable. You won’t want me in your house. You know, so — and he also adamantly spoke to whoever, that he — my parents were promised that we will be together, that — whether that — they were or not, I don’t know, but also that he was going to be with his sister, he was going to take care of me, we were not to be separated. And really, I do remember him making a scene with someone who wanted him, but wasn’t going to take me.

And I think they took us — and there were things that make me believe that — to show their community and their neighborhood how idealistic and charitable they were.

And they all gave each other courage, and if somebody failed the test, all the men got together and said, you have to take it again. Actually, the first group of men who took the licensing exam failed, because there were yes and no answers. There was a question to which you should say, true, false, yes, no.

   A: I’ve written about it, but not directly.
  </p>
  <p id="770">
   Q: Okay. How have you written about it?
  </p>
  <p id="771">
   A: I wrote a YA about the New York years, you know, being a refugee, and the different aspects of the refugee experience, living in New York. And it wasn’t — it’s a fictionalized version of me, and you know, I do write fiction. I tell more truth through fiction. Then I wrote a book about the orphan trains, that in the 20s, they went from New York City to the Midwest.
  </p>
  <p id="772">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="773">
   A: And I—I saw something about it on television, and I felt an identity with that. So I wrote about the orphan trains, but I put in some of my experience, and some of my feelings, though of course it was a different nationality, different time, I wasn’t an orphan, but —

   A: ’'ma writer of children’s books, and mostly teenage novels, some middle grade. Two picture books, but words only. Unfortunately, I can’t do art.

   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="781">
   A: Twenty-two books altogether.
  </p>
  <p id="782">
   Q: That’s quite an achievement. Tell me the title of the one that’s about the refugee Story.
  </p>
  <p id="783">
   A: The refugee in New York. They changed the title, I like my original title. My original title was “Goodbye Rita Hayworth.”
  </p>
  <p id="784">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="785">
   A: Which worked with what my story was about. But Rita Hayworth at that time was on the verge of dying, and they said to put out a book with that title would be very bad taste. Of course I didn’t mean it that way.

  <p id="786">

   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="793">
   A: And I’m very fond of that book. You know, I — I do like writing historical, I do like doing the research. And parts of — whole chapters are my story, but a whole lot of it 1s not at all.

  <p id="796">
   Q: But this is how you have expressed it. This is how it has come out in your writing.
  </p>
  <p id="797">
   A: I thought — I did think of writing directly about the Kindertransport, and I really can’t. For one thing, I would have to write it from a four or five year old’s point of view, in order to be authentic. And for what audience, you know, who’s going to read a four year old’s story? Also, I don’t think I really wanted to revisit it. I—I expressed myself in other ways, through fiction.
