   Q: So you made excellent work not out of love but out of fear?
  </p>
  <p id="426">
   A: Yeah, out of fear because if you goof up something or you don’t work right so they throw you out and I want to stay in a warm shop and they treat us good over there. Sometime we get extra plate of soup and survive there.
  </p>
  <p id="427">
   Q: I’m going to ask a slightly less relevant question but keeping in mind the debate today about American productivity and Japanese productivity and Communist productivity. Do you think the workmanship in this camp would have been better if you had been treated better and if you were free?
