So I had the full run of the East River, with relatives on both sides watching, to make s — make sure that I was doing all right. And that my mother knows if I didn’t do things right.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: Right.

  <p id="27">
   A: And every — I think it was marvelous, and there was plenty of woods to hide in, and I had a lot of fun with that. And in school I — I —I didn’t play ball, because when I was about — at about six years old, we had a big yard, and all the neighborhood came su — every Sunday afternoon to play ball. And I was batting, and my cousin, who lived next door, and was twice my size and was pitching, and he let one fly, hit me smack on the nose. And that ended my ball playing.

  <p id="56">
   Q: What made you came to that decision?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: I— what made me come to that decision? Well, I knew that everybody had to help, and I wanted to do my part. And I wanted to — at the time I wanted to go into the air force, so I enlisted for the air force. And that was great, they [indecipherable] my enlistment, and all that. And then it came time to report for active duty. So I went down to report for active duty [indecipherable] and made all the oaths and everything. And then they said, oh, we’re sorry, but the air force quota is filled for today. So, can’t get in the air force. I had enlisted for the air force, but the air force, it was part of the army. But, so they said, since you can’t get in the air  9February 21, 2014 force, if you go over and talk to those folks over there, they’re setting up the army specialized training program, and if you pass that exam, they’Il send you to school anyhow. So I took the exams and they sent me off to lo — Loyola University, which closed in five weeks, and I went off in — into the infantry.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: What was the appeal of the air force? Did you want to be a pilot, or an engineer?
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Well, I — I really wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. But I had been taking an air — correspondences courses while I was going to high school, 1n aeronautical engineering, and I wanted to learn to fly, too. But — so I could have a better understanding of how the airplane worked.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: But since I th — couldn’t get in the air force, and they sent me to Loyola University, they put me in a mechanical engineering program, which I wanted to do anyhow. So I learned — I got a degree in mechanical engineering, and I work — worked for the navy. In order to get the job I wanted in the navy, I had to have a degree in naval architecture. So I went back to the University of Michigan and studied naval architecture.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: It —1t — it worked. I got to be — got to be chief naval architect and — chief naval architect, and technical director for ship design for the navy.  10 February 21, 2014

  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: Yes, yes, the war was progressing, and they really needed troops in Europe [indecipherable] Pacific too. But it — th-the — mainly Europe. And the — the — the need for engineers were not overwhelming enough to — to keep the — keep the kids in school.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: Where did you go to basic training?

  <p id="69">
   A: Went through ki — Camp Roberts, California.

  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: I— well, when I went [indecipherable] Camp Roberts for basic, I was supposed to go into the — th-the AFCP six weeks basic training.

  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: Why’?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Because wa — when I got into combat in the infantry, I needed that.  7February 21, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: The — the extra — extra training, basic training was very valuable to me.

   Q: How did you find training? Was it difficult, physically, or mentally, or what have you?
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: It was all difficult, but not — not impossible, I to — I mean, basic training [indecipherable]
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: Yeah. No problem with that.
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: And was there any — was there a particular military field that you wanted to go into?
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: Well, I was — I was assigned to the infantry, so that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: Right. It’s my understanding though, that beyond infantry, you were specifically selected as a scout sniper.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: Yeah, ri— I— my — when I got in — well, I went through the basic training, and made the mistake of being first on the rifle range. And when our [indecipherable] boarding the ship going to Europe, somebody walked up and handed me, and said here, here’s your sniper rifle. And I became — I became a scout — scout sniper.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: So there was no — was there any specialized training specifically for sniper training?  DFebruary 21, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Just — just marksmanship.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Just marksmanship.
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: And do you feel that your childhood of hunting helped in that regard as well?
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: So you were very familiar, even before basic training, you were familiar with small arms, and —
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: Oh well, tha — that time I got into a problem, because growing up on a farm, and on ariver, I had guns from the time I was about six, seven years old. And one of my favorite sports in the fall was to go down to the cove, and shoot the heads off of water — water moccasins when they — they’d come up in the mating season, you know. And I got so that I could hit them pretty good. So when I — when I got in the army, I was too good on the rifle range, and I — I pretty well set — set the course.
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: After basic training, where did you go?
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Well, I— I went to the [indecipherable] reservation in California, and we were on watch for the Japanese. They really were afraid the Japanese were going to attack the west coast. They had a submarine come in, | think on either Oregon or Washington, and fire some shells ashore, and they thought that 1t was maybe the oncoming of another Pearl Harbor attack on the west coast. So my division was Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection PFebruary 21, 2014 scattered along the coast range California. We sat there for about, I don’t know, six months or so, to be there in case anything happened. Then they decided that my division was going to go to Europe, so they shipped me to — to South Carolina for more training at Camp Buckner, and then shipped me through New England to — to — to France and to Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: When did you arrive in Europe?
  </p>
  <p id="97">

  <p id="102">
   Q: And what wi — did you — you were transported by — by troop ship?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Yeah, mm-hm. There was a — a German troop ship, she — her — her German name was the German equivalent of [indecipherable] and she was called Alexander B. Hamilton, in the US Navy. And she took us over.

  <p id="104">
   Q: What was the crossing like?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: That was in January, and it was cold, and it was rough. Two weeks. And I — I did fine til I went down to my — to my — to the bunkroom. My bunk was on G deck, the lowest one down, right against the fore big bulkhead. And so you’re up and down Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection y February 21, 2014 40 feet every — every time [indecipherable]. And when si — to go to — to eat, you had to go up [indecipherable] the ladder to the main deck and stand — get in a line, and the — the feeding was continuous. The line went around all day long, and you’d go wa — go up, got in the line, went over to eat, and if you felt you might be hungry again during the day, you went around twice. Then back down to — down to the bunkroom. Well, I went down to the bunkroom, that’s on my first [indecipherable] and going down that ladder, all the way up and down, that really fixed it. And when I got down there, the whole bunkroom was about that deep, with the re-results of the other pe — other people’s had eaten lunch. Man, that was awful. So immediately I got assigned latrine duty, of course, which was cleaning up the whole place. That — that made it a very miserable trip.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: I bet. Was it very crowded?

  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: Did you make any friends on the way over, or did you have any special friends before landing in Europe?
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: Well, the — the people that were my friends were the people I went to school with. We all got — went and got [indecipherable] over the same — in — in at the same time. So the people I went over with were people I had gone — gone to school with, and they — they stayed with me, long as I was in the — the division. And of course, when we came back, we were get — we were — came back from — from the war, we were all still in the reserves, and we all got called up on the same orders to go to — to Korea. And I was working for the navy then, and the navy didn’t want me to go. I was — I was there working on ship design.

  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: Well, the first impres — impression was that it needed to warm up a little bit. It was January, so th-the — the fresh goop had melted, and when you stepped into the goop you were up to your knee, and the next time you went almost to your hip. And when you pulled your leg up, it weighed a ton. Bad. I had — I had read about that, and I talked to family and friends who had been in World War I, and I knew it — what it was going to be like.

   Q: Yes. And did you have to — did you have to take out both of the Germans, or —
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: Well, by — my squad was somewhere all behind me, so as soon as I fired, they all joined in.
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   A: And I got passed that and — and went on down the Moselle. Then I — when I got down to the Rhine, when we’re crossing the Rhine, I lost my best rifle. I [indecipherable] these little paddleboats, and I thought I was going to be on the left hand side of the boat, so I hung my [indecipherable] my rifle on my right shoulder. When I got to the boat something happened, and they shifted me onto the right side, and we’re paddling, trying to dodge all the shells that were coming in, the rifle slipped off, it fell in the Rhine. That was a good one.
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: Now that should have been the Rhine river crossing, we’re probably approaching the end of March.
  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: Mm-hm.

  <p id="172">
   Q: At that time, the combat should have been picking up a good deal.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   A: Oh, yes, it was thick, and pretty rugged. Well, we go — we got to the Rhine, I do —I don’t quite understand the rationale, but they decided that we — we — we sat on the Rhine on one side, watching the Germans, and they were on the other side watching us for three days. Then they decided we could sneak across three o’clock  7February 21, 2014 in the morning, they wouldn’t know we were coming. So we got out into the boats, and as soon as the first people got in the boats, the Germans fired tracer ammunition into buildings on both sides that were prepared, lit the place up like daylight, and those were the wooden boats that they can’t [indecipherable] in a hurry. But we managed to get across, and get the beachhead, and went on.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
   Q: Now, the — the main body of the 89" did not cross the Rhine in boats, they crossed on a pontoon bridge that was set up afterwards.

   Q: Okay.

  <p id="181">
   A: One of our — one of our squads, ma — my — the — the second — I was in the third squad of our platoon. The second — the first squad went across the river first, about one o’clock in the morning, and set up [indecipherable] along the beach, along the riverbank, to guide the boats that were going to be paddling across, bringing us across. And they were under the — under the little seawall, there was a little seawall about that high. They were under that seawall for two o’clock in the morning until Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3February 21, 2014 two o’clock in the afternoon before we could get to them. And when we got there, they had just fired their last round of ammunition; they didn’t lose a man. But there were Germans laying all over the place.

   A: — and machine gun fire too.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: Now, when you lost your rifle, how did you replace your weapon once you made it across?
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: Well, the only weapon I had going up east bank of the riv — of the Rhine was a — an [indecipherable] doub-double edged knife that my — my [indecipherable] knife that my father made for me, I wore it in my boot [indecipherable]. And I didn’t get —I didn’t get a rifle for two days. But I we — I went up the bank on the east side, and Pll — they’ll never know how I had got there, but I got along bank, and I was starting down the bank, looking for a place that I could get out of the way of this rifle fire, and there was laying a — a M3 Grease Gun machine — sub-machine gun,  13February 21, 2014 with two packages of ammunition. I never will know how they got there, but there it was. And from then I was the guy that opened the doors. Really something.

   A: Well, Eisenach, we could [indecipherable] we went through — went through the town of Velmic(ph), that was — that was a little village where we crossed. And then we went up the — up the [indecipherable] right up to the top, and w-we started going up, and there’s a little — a little walking path that went up to the apartment, and there was a stream coming down.

So we got up on top and then the — the next day we came to a big sugar beet country. That was the middle of a — I guess maybe a 600 acre shi — beet -- beet field. And the guy who [indecipherable] the beet field [indecipherable] with a — one of the MG-42 machine guns that fire 1200 rounds a minute. And I’m right in the middle of the field.

  <p id="200">
   Q: Sure.

   A: Oh yeah, yeah.

   Q: — and you in action against them. What opinion did you form of the Germans as soldiers and as professionals?
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: Oh, they were good soldiers. But I still — I can’t — can’t really bring my mind around to understand why, but in the time there that I was in the lead, and we were moving forward, I always saw them first.

   Q: Before they saw you?
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: Yeah. I ca—I can’t understand how that happened, but it did. Cause that day in the — in the beet field, I saw them before they started shooting at me, but they wasn’t a thing I could do, I was right in the middle of this beet field, no place to go. But several times I was able to — I think — I think I saved — saved a good portion of my — of my outfit, by being able to alert them to the fact that they were running into something that was going to be bad.

  <p id="277">
   A: Well, it reinforced what I already knew, yeah, I knew — I knew — I knew what we — what we were up to, and what we were fighting, but it — it sure reinforced my  34February 21, 2014 understanding of it, because there were — it was just absolutely horrible. I just finished reading the book called [indecipherable] Patton. And one section in it they discuss the — the — the — Ohrdruf, and Eisenhower and Patton came to s — to see the place, and they said it was so bad, that it upset Patton so bad that he went off to the side and — and lost his lunch.

   Q: What was the fighting like? Could you feel German resistance strengthening, or weakening?
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   A: Well — well, I was — it was weakening, because we were gradually wiping out the ones that were in there. And I got into some pretty — pretty fierce set-ons myself. At one time — one point, we were leaving a unit of the 76" division, and my platoon moved up to relieve one of that platoons, and I walked alongside the platoon sergeant, and he stood up. And of course, Patton required that we wear our insignia Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection -February 21, 2014 on our helmet right there, in gold. Nice and fi — nice and flashy. So he stood up, and when he stood up, bing, right through his insignia. And the next shot was for me, but somehow he missed. I don’t know how, because he had a fine rifle, and a fine telescope. But he missed. And I got down behind a spruce tree about that big.

And absolutely beautiful breads and cakes, and all kinds of stuff. And when we come through, the — the ladies of the household would trot out the baked goods for us to sample, and man, oh boy it was good. And the — the — in the — in Germany, southern Germany, most of the civilians that I ran into were not too — not too bad to — to talk to or get along with. When we got into Austria, man they were the most vicious ones that I ran into. Right in Salzburg.
  </p>
  <p id="308">
   Q: In — in what way”?
  </p>
  <p id="309">
   A: Well, the ones in Germany would — would talk to us, and they would just talk about, you know, just the average whatever you talk about. In Austria, as soon as you [indecipherable] was around Salzburg that this, you know, what — what we were doing to them, taking away their radios, taking away all this and that kinds of stuff. They didn’t have any of the stuff that they should have, because we were taking it all away. And what they had, was houses with six or eight rooms, some of them, with one room solid full packed with silverware that they got -- looted out of France and other countries that they’d taken over. I [indecipherable] they had a room full of — of plate and — and tableware, and all kinds of hou — silver [indecipherable]. All that kind of stuff just stacked up. Crazy.

   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="315">
   A: Yeah. I mean I — in France, soon as we got ashore and started moving, we were pushing them back. This Battle of the Bulge was sort [indecipherable]. I was off on the right hand side of that in — in France, but we were — obviously had them on the — on the [indecipherable] along.

  <p id="327">
   A: Oh, we’re actually across the — actually across the Rhine, they definitely [indecipherable] slowing — slowing down. And the troops there who were — who we were battling, were becoming less and less efficient.

And they were not — not as proficient as the soldiers we fought all up — up through the Rhine.
  </p>
  <p id="328">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="329">
   A: Some of them were very poor shots. That’s the reason I’m still here. Thank heavens for that, but a lot of them were older, and they were not the — not as — not the top notch soldiers that we fought [indecipherable] across the Rhine. But that was [indecipherable] where we ran into SS troops, and people were very topnotch soldiers. And at the end, when we were — when we wound up at — at Langenbach, we were getting ready for another push on the fifth of — fifth of March, I think, we — fifth of April — fifth of May, we were having another push into sh — into  41February 21, 2014 Czechoslovakia, and there was a whole — I don’t know how the arrangement 1s of SS troops, and the other t-topnotch troops that had been digging in and getting ready. And we were p-p-pushing off against them. But that would have been — that would have been a horrible battle. But just the — the — we lined — we lined up th-the — the — the infantry lined up in battle formation, the trucks started their engines, the tanks started their engines.

   Q: What was that experience like? Were they — these men who you had been fighting against for some time now, all are coming towards you, presumably with their hands up surrendering. What wa — that must have been an odd experience.

   A: Very odd. And ye-ye — course th — y-you didn’t — ye — we had no idea whether — whether we could trust them or not, you know? Th-That — they were pretty sneaky at lots of things, and it was a sort of a hard experience to stand there and watch them come out, you know, thousands of them, but just a — a few of us. And [indecipherable] weapons, they could have [indecipherable] us up pretty good. But it [indecipherable] surrender, they were — that’s all good.

  <p id="437">
   A: Oh, almost immediately. She was very attractive, and she was from — she was from Lovell(ph), Virginia, I was from Matthews County. And of course I speak the — I still speak a little bit of the Matthews County brogue, you know, in we — my family moved to Virginia in the 1620s, and they brought with them the Elizabethan English, and Matthews County is very isolated. Practically all the traffic in until — until I was born, practically all the traffic into Matthews County was by boat, so there wasn’t much traffic in and out. And the language tended to be preserved. The men who worked on ships, they went all over and they — gradually the men’s language changed. The women’s language stayed pretty much Elizabethan. When I was kid they still used something very close to Elizabethan English. I had a lot of that — a lot of [indecipherable]. And this — thi-this — so I still had a lot of that. So when I went to college, lot of the kids couldn’t understand what I said. And Carol showed up, they said hey, you speak the language. You gotta go talk to Bill, we can’t understand what he says.

  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: Oh well, I — I did quite a bit of de — the design work for the navy under contract. And I designed a few [indecipherable] vessels, some smaller vessels, 40 — 40 — 45 foot work boats and fishing boats, things like that. And I designed the — the [indecipherable] for the alexan — Alexandria Seaport Foundation.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: After I retired, I — I joined the Alexandria Seaport Foundation, and in ‘92 I became chairman of the Seaport Foundation. And at that time we had the old schooner, Alexandria, 125 foot [indecipherable] schooner. And I started a boatbuilding school to ha-have something for the kids at Alexandria and Washington — whole Washington area to do. And we — we — it really took off, I was amazed at that. You know, wh-when I went to set it up, I talked to the city council, and they weren’t very interested. I went and talked to the school board, ah, you’re wasting your time, they said, your kids don’t want to do anything like that, Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection =nFebruary 21, 2014 they want to play in the streets and all. But I— I persisted and I got the school started in 1992, and I started off with a— a group of 15 little kids that were 12 - 14 years old, and had a group of neighborhood supporters that would support them. And they all came in and we split them up into groups of five kids, with at least one adult with each group, so that they had some good supervision. I started them building little wooden boats. And I — we found that boy, when — when a lot of — most of those kids — most of them when they came, they were — boats didn’t mean anything at all to them. And doing anything with their hands didn’t mean to them. They didn’t di — they’d never done anything. But when they came in to us, about a week of working on a little boat that was going to be theirs when they finished, as long as they could actually do something, man, the effect was amazing. So that’s gone on since ’92 and it just kept on growing, it’s national now. A-As our system that we developed has been spread all over the country, and now a hundred, 185 organizations in the country that use our system, teaching kids to build little wooden boats. The little wooden boat is — is the key to it. They come in, and they get started with hammer and — and chisels and saws, things they had never touched before, and they learn to use those things, and they start building a little boat that they can see, I can do something that’s going to last and will be good for me —
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Sure.  sgFebruary 21, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="489">
   A: And that — it really gets them. Works very good. Then, a-after we got that going good, we started adding classroom exercises to help them with their schoolwork, and now we teach mathematics and physics and hi-history, and a couple of other courses occasionally, for the kids that are in high school and have trouble with a — with the high school. They don’t do well in — in math, a lot of the —a lot of the boys particularly don’t do well in math because they’re sitting there working on mathematical problems that don’t relate to anything. They can’t see any — any sense in it at all because it doesn’t — doesn’t relate to the things they do. But when they come in, we start teaching them to use mathematics to lay out the boats and [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff, and they see the use for it, it makes a big difference.

   A: Well, one thing, I was — th-the group that I was with were practically all volunteers, enlistees — enlistees, and of course, the — the — the main — main body at the World War II army was draftees.

   A: Well, yeah, professionalism, and in the way that indu — individ-individuals reacted with each other, the ones who had enlisted tended to be more interactive and worked together better than the ones that were drafted. That — that wasn’t — I mean [indecipherable] not the across the board thing, wa — everybody was still different. But the — the — overall, the — the — the people that I knew that were enlistees tended to, I thought, be a little bit easier to — to — to work with, and get things done. A lot Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection &lt;0February 21, 2014 of the — a lot of the draftees, some of them that I knew personally, were just, you know, absolutely overwrought with having been drafted.

   Q: Sure. You said when the Korean War broke out, there was an effort to re- mobilize you?

  <p id="501">
   A: Well, when the Korean War broke out, I — I was already demobilized [indecipherable] to the navy. And they — they started calling up the reserves again, and I got called up.

They didn’t want me to go, because I was working on a ship design business, and so they managed to the — get the orders — pre — get me off the orders. And that amazed me too, because th-they have to track it up unit by unit. They first tried the unit that I was assigned to, were turned down, and the next [indecipherable] they took it to the office of the president to get me released. As I [indecipherable] that really amazed me because I hadn't been at — I hadn't been at the navy very long.

  <p id="522">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   A: They have a very won — they had a wonderful — well, they still have a wonderful annual event where they have the old homes tour and colonial craft exhibits. I was very interested in — in the colonial crafts. I trava — I’m a gunsmith and make furniture, and all that kind of stuff. So I used to go to Waterford and go — go there for the fair every year, and got to working with some of the craftsman up there on Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3February 21, 2014 different things. So I— we got — both of us got so interested in it that we watched for a — a lot that we could buy, we were looking for a house, really. But we — none of the houses came up for sale that we could — could ha — could handle. So a lot came up for sale, so we bought the lot, 1968, and then we started drawing back — I started making designs for houses. And, of course, in Waterford they had all — had all kinds of restrictions on what you could build because they wanted to keep the tenor of the village. So I designed what I thought was a real [indecipherable] house, and I took it to the [indecipherable] took it to the — the architect who was the [indecipherable] on what you could build. Showed it to him, he said, oh, that’s a nice little house Bill, but that — that’s — that would look beautiful in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, but that’s not for Waterford. So I went back, and I designed a brick house. Oh, he said, man, Williamsburg. Beautiful Williamsburg house. Not for Waterford. So about that time, my wife was reading [indecipherable] the “Washington Post,” and at the bottom end of the classified ads was, log house for sale. They were tearing down a log house because they built — had new houses all around it, they — they couldn’t do anything except tear — tear down and move it. So we went over — she said, let’s go over and take a look at it. Well, that was the first week in May, 1970. And I said, oh, I’m too busy, I can’t take — make it. So next week she tried again. The house was still for sale. Third Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection «4February 21, 2014 week, still for sale, tried again. The fourth week, Sunday — Sunday afternoon, it was raining cats and dogs, the kids were grumpy as all get out. Said okay, let’s take the kids over, we’ll go look at it. So we went over and there’s this log house. By that time they’d taken the roof off, and it was raining for all week, and water dripping on everything. We opened the back door, and the inside of the house had been lone — had been lined with [indecipherable] board, you know, this fabulous tan, soft fiber, insulating board? And when we opened the back door there was enough [indecipherable] that the whole ceiling collapsed, and two tons of water and all frazzly wood came down. But it opened up everything so I could see all the logs. And it was in good shape. Only two logs needed some — some moderate repairs. So right there we bought the log house, and we [indecipherable] hire a guy to haul the logs over to our lot to Waterford so we could rebuild it. And he started loading up the logs, he says, hey, you know, my father’s got a log house three miles over there, that he hasn’t used for 10 years, he’d probably sell that to you, if you wanted it. So [indecipherable] that was very reasonable, so I bought that and they moved both of them over, and we combined the two of them to make one house in Waterford. And we finished it [indecipherable] lived in it to the point where we lived in it about 1975. And we had — still had floors missing, and no doors or windows installed, things like that, but we moved 1n in time for the kids to go to school in the Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection «February 21, 2014 fall, and then I built it up from the inside. So that’s how — that’s how we got into that.

   A: I was planning on building a boat, I had — had — had a design along the way for a 36 footer. But she wasn’t really too keen on a boat.
