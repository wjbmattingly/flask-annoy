And they put him out and he was afraid, and this was like a--they got two doctors, German doctors. It was a tremendous location. Snow, it was the winter, it was no heat at all over there. I went over there one day, I want to see how this goes on. Like in the army, they undressed and they went like a commission, from one doctor to another. You name this and that where you work. And I told to him, listen, you can go free. Don’t worry about anything. Everything was shriveled. He stayed for half an hour over there, naked to wait for the doctors. Don’t think they will recognize who you are. This is what it was. He went one day to this commission, or to this recruiting thing, and they took him and they let him go home.
