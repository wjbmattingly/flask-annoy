  </p>
  <p id="99">

  </p>
  <p id="101">

  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: Eighty acres?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Something — something not — not very big, but she — I think she — she was the one that directed the arrangement for the g-gardens, and —
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: It was still the sa — somewhat in the process of being formed, anyway, at that time, and this is — here is the beginning of the war, too.January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: Yeah. But 80 acres, if we’re talking about eight-zero, that’s a lot of acreage.
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: Well, I— I don’t know exactly hectares, and —
  </p>
  <p id="108">
   Q: Ah, do you remember how many hectares?
  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: No, I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="110">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: But I think it’s listed somewhere. I don’t remember exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   Q: The reason I focus on this, because I want to get a sense of whether your mother’s family were landowners.
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: Oh, this was the la — the la — that property was given by the government because of mother’s brother be — taking part in a Polish ri — let’s see, the rise of that territory, because remember, Poland was divided be-before that.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: And divided in what way?
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: Well, div-divided de-depending which — how shall I say? Which — there is a Polish word, and an English word, and I can’t — Poland was divided —
  </p>

  <p id="121">
   A: As far as I know, on the — it was Russian.
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: I see. And then, does that mean that your mother’s brother took part in some kind of battles, or some kind of —
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: Well, he — he wa — he de-deserved some compensation from the government, because he put — he was in that category of helping the — those that fought for the liberation of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Thank you. That’s what I wanted to understand, how it is that he got some land. So that meant he fought for Polish independence during and after the first World War. Is that correct?
  </p>
  <p id="125">
   A: Yeah, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="126">
   Q: Okay. Okay. And so the land was then given to him.
  </p>

  <p id="228">
   Q: Do you have any idea why they came to arrest you?

And — and then, when he got to the labor camp, they were — they weren’t together, but they were there in that camp, but they weren’t together. And then, shortly afterwards, what she’s talking about, he — he got in — he went to prison, and then when Hitler attacked Russia, they were — he was let go, just like my father was let go, and into that Polish army. So she doesn’t really know how he got to the labor camp.

  </p>
  <p id="285">
   A: Of course. I mean, th-the child, it doesn’t translate to them the same tune, it seems. The child — I could hold my mother’s hand, so that was a reassuring. But other than that, no.

  <p id="286">
   Q: Were there other children on the train?

  <p id="299">
   A: But other than that, 1t — we didn’t really [indecipherable] very much. There was a — this place that once we get part of the road, we had to go by sleighs.

  <p id="310">
   Q: You mentioned that when the soldiers came to deport you, you heard the hooves of their horses, and they took you by sleigh. Does that mean you were deported in wintertime?

  </p>
  <p id="321">
   A: Yeah, well, I think they — they used the water that cooled the engines in the locomotives to make some broth or something like that, I think. So that was a partJanuary 23, 2015 of the, quote, food that we had. But in — in the wagon — in the cattle cars, there really wasn’t very much assistance, except guards to make sure that you stayed with the train, and —

  <p id="333">
   A: Well, it — the sleigh — th-the — this — the — they had — that territory had very bad snowstorm, and we were right in the middle of it. But we had a — some kind of soup, I think, to — we were fed, a little. Other than that, I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="334">
   Q: When they took you to the place that had been an army barracks, you told me, yes, it had been some sort of military place, was that correct?

   Q: Your own fire? Did people make their own fire, inside the barracks?
  </p>
  <p id="347">
   A: Yeah, I think you could use the facility that they had — th-there were two camps that they m-moved us to, Mother and I, but I don’t remember very much about the — one of. I just remember that they — Mother had to work very hard as a lumberjack.

   Q: It — it sounds — are you — all right, let’s pause. [break] So your mother — I — your mother must have had an un — incredible hard life there.
  </p>
  <p id="353">
   A: Well, she did, because I — and I was partially responsible, I was a burden. She — she could do so much — a woman can do so much, but in her case, we didn’t have possessions to — so we could exchange and sell things. We didn’t have very much to sustain us.
  </p>
  <p id="354">
   Q: Did anybody help you?
  </p>
  <p id="355">
   A: No —no. There was a — one incident, I had the be — some kind of an infection, or — on the foot, and they send me to the felcher(ph) — doctor in camp. It’s a — that just stayed with the kids that were — if the husband was with the family, theyJanuary 23, 2015 allowed the woman to stay and look after the child, or children. But usually, in a case like this, you don’t work, you don’t eat. And when they — when the — the supplies came in, sometimes the supplies were somewhat ridiculous, because they would send ball gowns at the time that you need warm boots. So you couldn’t —
  </p>
  <p id="356">
   Q: Crazy.
  </p>
  <p id="357">
   A: — you couldn’t even buy things.

   A: And the guards, yeah, something on that order.
  </p>
  <p id="364">
   Q: Was — was there a fence around the camp? Was it like a prison?

  <p id="368">
   Q: Is this the place you stayed for a long time?
  </p>
  <p id="369">
   A: Well, the longest time that the camps were in operation supposedly, the beginning of the second war, and when the Yelta release started pouring —

  <p id="373">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="374">
   Q: Because I reme — I thought it was when Germany attacked the Soviet Union, then there weren’t enough soldiers to help defend the allies, and the Polish government in exile came to an agreement with Stalin.

   A: Well, that’s why the units were formed, and Polish government to Polish forces outside Russia tried to participate, and I — start these units that also helped some civilians. And we were the civilians.

   Q: How — how did you find out about it?
  </p>
  <p id="381">
   A: Well, it’s a— someone managed to get out of prison and wor-work himself back to the camp, and tell us about it. Although the Russians were supposedly — supposed to inform us, they didn’t.

   Q: They didn’t. I see.

   A: And it-t-t — it was okay.

  <p id="504">
   Q: Yeah. And when you said your mother found out about these Polish units being formed, and she was going to sign up to be a nurse, and she arranged that you would be in an orphanage, would that have been staying in the camp, or would that have been an orphanage of Polish children moving with the unit?
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Oh no, it was being the same as in camp. There was — you couldn’t trust the Russian authorities, whatever. There were kids that were picked up by the railway stations and the other places, that spoke maybe Polish, but they — once they were taken to the orphanages, they disappeared from existence.
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: So it was not to a Soviet orphanage she would have gi — she would have left you.

   Q: That’s a good long time. That’s a — what part of India were you in?
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   A: Karachi to Bombay, along that part. A few places, but —
  </p>
  <p id="751">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="752">
   A: We had ver — relatively little contact, or communication with the — with the country itself, because we were simply the refugee [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="753">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. And if you stayed there four years, that means that it was the late 1940s before you left, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="754">
   A: About that. We left after the India received its changeover, and the — became not part of the English empire, but India.
  </p>
  <p id="755">
   Q: Ah, so when the India — India became independent.
  </p>
  <p id="756">
   A: Independent, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="757">
   Q: I see. And from there, where did you go?
  </p>
  <p id="758">
   A: Well, England. Mother and I went — went to England to — to — then Danuta’s father and my mother married, and we decided to try out American soil.
  </p>
  <p id="759">
   Q: And how old were you when you came to the ameri — to the United States?January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="760">
   A: Well, I was college age.
  </p>
  <p id="761">
   Q: Already college age? So that meant you were — like in the early 1950s, something like that?
  </p>
  <p id="762">
   A: Early 50s.
  </p>
  <p id="763">
   Q: Early 50s. And where was — where was Danuta born? In Britain?
  </p>
  <p id="764">
   A: In Britain.
  </p>
  <p id="765">
   Q: I see. Is there anything else, Mira, that I have not asked you, that you think is important for people to know, about your story?
  </p>
  <p id="766">
   A: There was an incident about the goats. After work Mother went to the edge of the camp, and cut down those young twigs that just sprout out leaves. And at that time she used to sing, she used to — to tell me — taught me — well, I guess, the poem. I d—I don’t remember the — that — the author, whatever, but anyway, we — we were playing, the kids were playing hide and seek or something, and I — I was with them. They started to go — go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem what Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, 1t was po — essential that you don’t shake the — the bundles, because the leaves would fall off, and the goats wouldn’t get any food. So you had — Mother make me be — listen very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-talk to the kids, not to go and play on — in the loft. Well, one time the kids made comments about this and that. Finally,January 23, 2015 one said, oh, to the ghost, that they — that they heard noises, whatever, like finally one of them says — says, oh, if we ta — say a prayer, it will all right.
  </p>
  <p id="767">
   Q: Okay, so they thought that —
  </p>
  <p id="768">
   A: So we started saying a prayer, but the boy — I don’t know which prayer it was, but anyway, they started saying a prayer, and I was saying the same ti — prayer, but I— I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all those kids going up there. Finally, I decided not — not to say a prayer.
  </p>
  <p id="769">
   Q: Not to say one.
  </p>
  <p id="770">
   A: No... not to say a prayer.
  </p>
  <p id="771">
   Q: Were you able to keep them from going upstairs to the loft?
  </p>
  <p id="772">
   A: Well, he did ...
  </p>
  <p id="773">
   Q: So Mira, it’s okay. Again, this is something you’ll remember later. That often happens to people.
  </p>
  <p id="774">
   A: No. It’s a— A2: You were wor — one or two words behind in the prayer, and they thought it was a ghost. Remember that part of it?
  </p>
  <p id="775">
   A: The what? A2: You were saying it, the prayer, one or two words behind, and they thought it was a ghost, remember’?
  </p>
  <p id="776">
   A: Not that one, no.January 23, 2015 A2: No?
  </p>
  <p id="777">
   Q: That’s okay.
  </p>
  <p id="778">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="779">
   Q: It’s okay. Is there anything else you’d like to add to what we’ve talked about?
  </p>
  <p id="780">
   A: Well, I don’t know, you’ve been very patient with me, but — and this isa—a somewhat unfair trial for me.
  </p>
  <p id="781">
   Q: I can understand that, and I appreciate — I know that it has taken a lot of strength and energy to talk about. Thank you. Thank you for doing it. I think what I’ll do now, is that we’ll conclude our interview, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with you, Mira. So this concludes it with Mira Zimmerman, on January 23", 2015. [break]January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="782">
   Q: Okay. This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Danuta Soletski(ph) Urbikas, on January 23", 2015. And Danuta, I want you to tell us a little bit about how you are related to Mira, and how you have come to know about her story. So.
  </p>
  <p id="783">
   A: So, Mira and I have the same mother. My mother met my father in that whole turmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp, and she and Mira were released from — well, they escaped actually, from the labor camp. And it was in Tatishchevo, near Saratov, where was the first Polish army camp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't been murdered in the Soviet Union. So they met there briefly, and they actually met again later on in Jelibod(ph), which was in Uzbekistan, or I don’t know, it’s on the border, near Tashkins(ph). Tashkins(ph) was another area where the Polish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from Tatishchevo, or near Saratov.
  </p>
  <p id="784">
   Q: Okay. So I would like to — for us to trace. I mean, some of the things that I asked Mira, she didn’t remember where she wa — you know, what the towns were, and so on. And tell me, how is it that you know all of these places?
  </p>
  <p id="785">
   A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing up. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, sheJanuary 23, 2015 agreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on this project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the history. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you know, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who were aware of — of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been deported.
  </p>
  <p id="786">
   Q: Okay, so I'd like to start from — from the beginning at least, but we’ll run through it, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="787">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="788">
   Q: So, Mira was born in Grodno, and that was in what part of Poland’?
  </p>
  <p id="789">
   A: That at the time was eastern Poland. Today it is Belarus, right on the border really, with Lithuania and — and not too far from where the current border of Poland is.
  </p>
  <p id="790">
   Q: Okay. And from Grodno, do you know what deportation they were taken on? Was it the February one?
  </p>
  <p id="791">
   A: The February 10" one, yes, in 1940.
  </p>
  <p id="792">
   Q: Okay. And where were they taken to?
  </p>
  <p id="793">
   A: They were taken first to a camp at — across the Urals, which would have been technically Siberia. And I’m trying to remember the — one was Mikelinska(ph), do you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank.January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="794">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="795">
   A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And then they were taken back to another camp near Perm, which is of Molotov. And that was where they really were for the duration of the time in the — in the labor camp.
  </p>
  <p id="796">
   Q: So Perm was a pretty tough place.
  </p>
  <p id="797">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="798">
   Q: The — some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that you are familiar with, that you had heard about before?
  </p>
  <p id="799">
   A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but — you know, these were things that were discussed, especially at — during holiday times, or whenever our Polish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories, and they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you know, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my mother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very — you know, she — she wo — she went through so much, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="800">
   Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I’m clear about, she had to work as a lumberjack?
  </p>
  <p id="801">
   A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she was, you know, generally speaking, the — the Soviets took people who wereJanuary 23, 2015 working in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And the people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was saying, there was no one else f — to work for them. It was just my mother. And so they came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the forest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they felled, and — and yes, there was one occasion when she — I don’t know, you know, she was so tired by then, and — and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated by the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving Mira, that she didn’t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And — and so this tree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they — and watched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a pile of rubble, and the — the branches from this rubble actually cut the —
  </p>
  <p id="802">
   Q: Broke the —
  </p>
  <p id="803">
   A: — broke the fall. So she — she was in there, and they thought — the Soviets, the brigadier, the supervisor of the — of the work team thought she was trying to kill herself, you know. And so they got mad at her for — for, you know, doing that. And so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up getting ga new job working — fixing — changing the oil on tractors, and also filling — there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for that. But, you know, in the co — in the course of all of that, you know, she di — sheJanuary 23, 2015 almost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the Soviets, especially the — the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or Byelorussian’s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing Polish patriotic songs, and you know, just really — she kind of did things that didn’t help her, you know, and that’s another thing that happened. So when she went to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were — they were just — you know, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn’t like her.
  </p>
  <p id="804">
   Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this — how this developed, the context of such a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay.
  </p>
  <p id="805">
   A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was another one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten — like gone back to get a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was actually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I think a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn’t getting paid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a day. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.
  </p>
  <p id="806">
   Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever — was she ever told why she was deported?
  </p>
  <p id="807">
   A: Because she was a landowner.January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="808">
   Q: That’s what I thought, that’s what I thought.
  </p>
  <p id="809">
   A: And — and also, I think they may have also known that her — they were still married, even though they were separated, her husband was a — a soldier, you know, he was sergeant in the army.
  </p>
  <p id="810">
   Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there’s the agreement between the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people who had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it from a former prisoner, rather than officials.
  </p>
  <p id="811">
   A: Right, they — the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it was somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about this, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but they weren’t — they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they escaped.
  </p>
  <p id="812">
   Q: So tell me, this incident what — that Mira was talking about, where she would be a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this —
  </p>
  <p id="813">
   A: Well, that’s much later, actually.
  </p>
  <p id="814">
   Q: Oh, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="815">
   A: That’s much later. Yeah, at — when — when my mother and sister were escaped from the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is thatJanuary 23, 2015 incident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they made it to — oh, now I’m drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think’? A2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.
  </p>
  <p id="816">
   A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to Pahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I’m skipping something. There was a lo — there was — all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there — you know, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And there was a huge mass of people, and they na — they didn’t know where to put them. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and forth, trying to find a place to — to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that. And in that turmoil, that’s when they met my father again, okay?
  </p>
  <p id="817">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="818">
   A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better by then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these resettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that’s where my mother and Mira were there. I’m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was many months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so, she did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and there were there as — as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother January 23, 2015 being a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school that was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense more of the geography. So from what I understand from you’re telling me, is that the camp they ended up staying in was bet — was in Perm, the region of Perm.
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where they were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk, is that wh-where you were saying?
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   A: They went to Tatishchevo.
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   Q: Tatishchevo.
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   A: Near as —
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   Q: And what is Tatishchevo?
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   A: It’s a city or town near Saratov.
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   Q: I see, okay, in Russia itself.
  </p>
  <p id="828">
   A: In Russia, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   Q: And it was in Tatishchevo that they met your father —
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   Q: — for the first time?
  </p>
  <p id="832">
   A: Right. January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there?
  </p>
  <p id="834">
   A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and he was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania. And then from there he was sent —
  </p>
  <p id="835">
   Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern Poland’?
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania?
  </p>
  <p id="840">
   A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and — from the Germans, and they were — 0-or no, maybe it was — I’m not sure now. I think it was — no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got — they got caught and — and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they were sent — he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   Q: Kozelsk.
  </p>
  <p id="842">
   A: Or — or Kozelsk, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="843">
   Q: So he was a Russian POW?
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="845">
   Q: Okay. He was a Polish POW —
  </p>
  <p id="846">
   A: POW. January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   Q: — under the Soviets, excuse me.
  </p>
  <p id="848">
   A: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   Q: And — and he was not — he was not shot.
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   A: No, there was — hi — at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these officers were being sent somewhere, but they didn’t know where. And he was taken, actually, to — they were going to build an airstrip or something up further north, in the tundra, and — at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point Germany had in — attacked Poland — I mean, Russia, and so they were camped there for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know, th-that — there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army. A2: Armestu(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   A: It was ca — yeah, was —
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   Q: Yeah, an amnesty.
  </p>
  <p id="853">
   A: — the amnesty. And so then, from there, I — somehow he — you know, made his way towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.
  </p>
  <p id="854">
   Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and my father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles. A2: Well, no, he’s th — I was holding up a box, a — a— a matchbox of some sort.
  </p>
  <p id="856">
   A: Okay.January 23, 2015 A2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa — a pile of rubles, or something like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or — or d-don’t have anything to — to — that I would be able to buy some food.
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   Q: I see. Okay. A2: And he — he put some more of his money into the box, and gave it to me. And I refused to take it, Mother wouldn’t let me take it.
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember? A2: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and — and then you came back another time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something. A2: Oh, I think the — he — he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids some sugar, and some honey.
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the children. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that were the same age. I’m sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him, you know, of them.
  </p>
  <p id="861">
   Q: I see. And did he talk about this — these stories as well, and this incident?
  </p>
  <p id="862">
   A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.
  </p>
  <p id="863">
   Q: Okay, so when he met Mira the first time, and so on. A2: Mm-hm. January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="864">
   Q: And then Mira introduced him to your mother.
  </p>
  <p id="865">
   A: Right. Well, as it’s — as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some kind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know, he broke rank and came over, and met my mother.
  </p>
  <p id="866">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="867">
   A: Our mother.
  </p>
  <p id="868">
   Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo, you Mira, and your mom, went further south, 1s this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and forth?
  </p>
  <p id="869">
   A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying to find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really, actually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was cold. By then it was, you know, November, December of ’41, and there was very little food, and my mother was — our mother was trying to find, you know, food, and there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually much worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another — you know, to —to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money — she — they say — I don’t know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him for s — help, because she really — they were so destitute, she — they had — they — their luggage was stolen, this is the —January 23, 2015 A2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi — center office of the — of the forming units. She owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your father.
  </p>
  <p id="870">
   A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I’m sure he collected from the other soldiers, of like 367 — A2: Twenty — 300 some —
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: And it’s — 367’s the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my mother and her. This 1s when she — they were both sick. A2: Any money se — being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that.
  </p>
  <p id="872">
   A: Yeah, it was — it was quite a miracle that that money got — and that really saved them, because they — at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and there was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just really very hard.
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   Q: So it sounds like it was almost the first kindness that she had received —
  </p>
  <p id="874">
   A: Well —
  </p>
  <p id="875">
   Q: — from all this — from all of these experiences.
  </p>
  <p id="876">
   A: Well, could — probab — the one that, course, stands out the most.
  </p>
  <p id="877">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="878">
   A: Yeah.January 23, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="879">
   Q: And then it was after that, and they got better, that — from where did they leave the Soviet Union?
  </p>
  <p id="880">
   A: So they made it over to — oh, now I’m losing my train of thought here. A2: Kovachi(ph)?
  </p>
  <p id="881">
   A: No, no, no, that’s India. Krasnovodsk — am | saying that right? And then from there, to Pahlevi.
  </p>
  <p id="882">
   Q: Which is in Iran.
