  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: The soldiers didn’t talk nothing — soldiers, they didn’t say. The officers used to, between them, they used to let them get cooked by themselves.

  <p id="734">
   Q: I have a question that’s a bit of a sensitive question, about the army. Many east European countries were terrified of the Soviet army, because of rapes, because of what happened to the female population. Did you see or hear anything about that when you were with them?

  <p id="735">
   A: Here and there, I knew it was going come. But the main thing was, where I was with them it was — we went Ukraine, Poland, and in Germany. In Poland also, they used to abuse, here and there. But when you crossed over Germany, then was a holiday.

  </p>
  <p id="742">

And you’re talking there — there was a — about 15,000 — 15 million Germans there. And 12 million, they pushed them out there, a lot of — right away, a lot of — pushed them, and they took advantage Russia. If they find a Russian soldier killed, they burned the whole sa — village and killed everybody. But doesn’t matter wa — how — what they did, they didn’t 10 percent what the German did to them.

He said, I have to take revenge for them. This is only one of those. In a lot of those locations, they did a lot of them like this. They start to run away, we shoot them.

We got a lot of weapons from Czechoslovakia. We start to get some cannons, some planes, little 104 May 16, 2014 by little, we rebuilt, and we start to push the Arabs back. When there was the second ceasefire, we were in a different situation because we could bring in everything, just money. And with money you know from where it came. Who could give the money?

That the whole world, even United States, they knew what’s going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the — not only to the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality. And they knew what’s going on. And what they do? Did you hear — did you hear somebody 108May 16, 2014 give a speech about this? Maybe they were too busy with — with their own war, but they should at least say something.
  </p>
  <p id="1208">
   Q: A real abandonment.
  </p>
  <p id="1209">
   A: Yeah. When I was hiding, I didn’t maybe think about this, I wasn’t maybe enough old to think things like this, but after, I start to think, where all the world was? And they had the power to do something. Maybe not — maybe if they would threaten Germany that we will wipe you up of the wa — of the war, maybe they would behave a little bit themselves, but they didn’t do nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="1210">
   Q: You were telling me also earlier that there were young men when you were — you know, when you were still in the ghetto in Mlynov, who went to the Judenrat, and instead of giving the gold to the Germans, the young men were saying, give it to us so that we can get weapons. How do you explain that, that the young men wanted this, and the — and the older men, the Judenrat did otherwise?
  </p>
  <p id="1211">
   A: I don’t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was witnesses to this. They begged to them, give us money, give us something that you give away to the German, we’|l buy some and try to survive. Maybe 25 percent would survive, but give us something. Let us at least do something, not to go like sheeps to — to the killing area. I don’t know, maybe this was the — the — for years the Jews were depressed. Maybe the — they were too religious and b-believing in something that cannot help us. Can only pray and can believe in something — I don’t 109 May 16, 2014 know. I’ve no explanation. As I told you, that I don’t believe any more in this traditional religion, because when I crawled between the legs to the synagogue — why? Because I want to also hear th-the praying, and I saw what’s going on, everybody’s crying and everybody is begging, and the roof didn’t open up and those ... and the angels didn’t come and save us. And what can I tell you more?
  </p>
  <p id="1212">
   Q: Yeah. When — I’m sorry.
  </p>
  <p id="1213">
   A: No problem.
  </p>
  <p id="1214">
   Q: When — when did it become possible for you to open up and talk about si — because clearly there’s such a cost.
  </p>
  <p id="1215">
   A: The last couple years.
  </p>
  <p id="1216">
   Q: And why?
  </p>
  <p id="1217">
   A: Listen, you get older, you start to think different. With age, you change your mind, you change your behavior. You physically get changed, and maybe that’s the [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1218">
   Q: Do you think your family knows you better now that you — when you have opened up?
  </p>
  <p id="1219">
   A: I hope.
  </p>
  <p id="1220">
   Q: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you have raised a successful — you’ve had a family, you’ ve raised children, you’ve had grandchildren.
  </p>
  <p id="1221">

  </p>
  <p id="1222">
   Q: There goes another thing. It sounds to me like you inherited some of your father’s strength. Because if he knew how to deal —
  </p>
  <p id="1223">
   A: I think so, I think so, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1224">
   Q: Yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="1225">
   A: My father was a strong man.
  </p>
  <p id="1226">
   Q: Yeah. Do you think that it was also, because he knew so many people, that that helped you in — when he knew so many people in the villages, and the surrounding area, and when you would knock on someone’s door and say, I’m his son —
  </p>
  <p id="1227">
   A: I—I didn’t know too many. I know some of them, but I came in in some villages to se — I mean, I didn’t know them at all. I mean, they ask me whose — who you are, who’s your father? When I told them Moshke(ph), then they’re oh, we know him good. But — because he used to deal with them, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1228">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1229">
   A: My father used to — I’ll give you just an example. Every week, he used to kill seven cows; seven, eight cows. We used to have in our stable, steady, staying six, seven cows, because he used to supply for them and the Polish army used to come for maneuvers all summer, used to supply meat for them. They used to supply meat for the prince, he had like two — 300 people working for him, he has to give them some food.

  </p>
  <p id="1241">
