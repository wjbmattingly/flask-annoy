  <p id="511">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   A: And the -- the organiz -- the social services department turned the Beit Karlotseim into a social organization. And this I acs -- saw it, but this was a move to young people to prepare the transportations w-when -- if c-comes.
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="514">

  </p>
  <p id="519">
   Q: They did.
  </p>
  <p id="520">
   A: They didn’t go -- because the head of the social bi -- department, Dr. Katz didn’t even talk to them.
  </p>
  <p id="521">
   Q: So the so-called adults --
  </p>
  <p id="522">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="523">
   Q: -- just made a decision that you felt put the youth in peril?

  </p>
  <p id="527">
   Q: And you got all the youth to go along with you?
  </p>
  <p id="528">
   A: Yes. Because then I was a -- then I was a -- a -- I was no longer head of the hek -- Beit Karlotseim, because I was sus -- suspect, because I said -- and that was actually what happened. The young people were sent to a -- a -- a-- a-- a camp in -- in Bohemia to -- to prepare the -- the -- the future ghetto in Terezin, because that time, Jewish community got the idea that -- that Terezin is the future of the Jews, a-and why at that time already two transportations went to -- to Lodz, because -- and that’s -- the Jewish community -- I’d believe so, they -- they -- they believed that was at -- a -- a solution for the Jewish problem in -- in ber -- bets -- ter -- te -- ter -- [indecipherable] Berman and Melber -- Bohemia and Moravia, because they would save the Czech Jews from being sent abroad to -- if -- ist -- it’s proved to be death camp. But they a -- the Jewish community believed in that. I didn’t. And -- and th- the youth repaired th -- Terezin as the ghetto. They were -- th-they were -- we -- s -- were strong. And youth, be -- I -- and young people, and dup -- keek -- they did prepare it. And when the ghetto came into being, I -- the -- the -- I can’t. I can’t.
  </p>
  <p id="529">
   Q: When -- when the ghetto came into being, did you feel vindicated in any way? Did you feel like, look, I -- I pointed this out to you, that this was a problem here?
  </p>
  <p id="530">
   A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And how in -- how long -- A2: The directorship.
  </p>
  <p id="531">
   A: The directorship of the ghetto was almost hundred percent Zionist, because that was Jankov Edelstein’s work, because he -- he believed in that, I think.
  </p>
  <p id="532">
   Q: And where was the rest of your family during this time? Where was your mother, and father, and sister?
  </p>
  <p id="533">
   A: Fa -- Father was dead, and Mother -- and the sister lived 1-1n pa -- sw -- in a -- a one room, expecting to -- to be transported, but 1t was not -- she -- she was -- she went to -- to Terezin s -- much - a bit later. I -- at that time, I published a leaflet warning the people who was the directorate in Terezin against -- it was very -- I don’t -- I don’t --
  </p>
  <p id="534">
   Q: So e -- were you -- in the leaflet, did you basically say look, your leaders are misleading you?
  </p>

  <p id="538">
   Q: So what -- what did you do then?
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: Well, la -- the directorate of the Hehalutz al -- in the Hehalutz was the -- the Hashomer Hatzair, and they voted against it. They wanted to keep me. Bu-But -- because I went to live with a friend of mine, a- a German Jews -- Jew, who was married to a -- to the Aryan Jew -- a -- a German.

And then after -- 1n that period, he called me and said to me, “Listen, the -- the -- the people t-tell me that you are also half-Jewish, a-and what is the matter?” And I told him, if a man has a bit of shekel -- and I use the word shekel, you immediately think h-he -- he is a half Jew.

And afterward I send a -- a yurnafarka and -- and -- and then who are -- who -- I met a -- as a Jew, I met one Czech, and -- and by the name of Lahrer, and I -- and he ex -- he thought hi-his summonsed to this yurnafarka and he went to Germany as a friend [indecipherable].

   A: Meier didn’t like this.
  </p>
  <p id="980">

  <p id="1005">
   A: Afterwards, I went three -- three years head of the African department 1-in Jerusalem, and then I was sent to the U.N. for -- for three years, and then I went to Copenhagen, and also to Iceland. What?
