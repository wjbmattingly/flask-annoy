  </p>
  <p id="314">
   Q: Go back a little bit in time.
  </p>
  <p id="315">
   A: When they made the little ghetto, that was where the Jewish quarter used to be before the war. And there we had something like 2000 people that remained to clean the ghetto. So we stayed there for like two months and they liquidated that little ghetto. And from that little ghetto they left maybe 200 people that worked for those huts in that big factory. When they liquidated that little ghetto from the 2000 people that they have left, they took 200 to send them to that factory to work. And the 1800 they dispersed in different camps in Poland. They really took me out to be sent to one of those camps. When I, when they took me out, I kind of sneaked, tried to sneak back in, and the Jewish policeman that watched that nobody should sneak back in, he knew me very well. And I knew them and I used to play with his daughter.
  </p>
  <p id="316">
   Q: What was his name? Do you remember the family?
  </p>
  <p id="317">
   A: Yeah, Kornentz. And he saw me sneaking in and he gave me the eye and he said get lost. Ana I snuck back into the little ghetto so I stayed with my brothers. My uncle they took him out also at that time. He stayed on and they took him to the, one of the camps, concentration camps in Poland. And I stayed and then as I said they liquidated that small little, they took us to that to the factory, where we were. And I stayed there til I went to Buchenwald.
  </p>
  <p id="318">
   Q: Seems to me you were a very independent young boy. From what you said.
  </p>
  <p id="319">
   A: No, I was lucky. I was kind of lucky. Every situation played my way. I wasn’t that smart but since I had brothers that stayed and I going to go to the factory to live. I figured I want to stay with them. And I was lucky that that policeman was standing at that time and let me go through.
  </p>
  <p id="320">
   Q: Yes, of course, luck and independence. So now let’s get down to the rail car, unfortunately. What were the conditions like in that?
  </p>
  <p id="321">
   A: In that, well it was much better I would say the big factory than Buchenwald.
  </p>
  <p id="322">
   Q: I’m talking about your journey to Buchenwald. You said you were in that rail car.
  </p>
  <p id="323">

He said well, maybe [ll find some work for you here. So he scraped around and this is where I stayed and he saw to it, I should not go out to work anymore. Because I was the youngest in the group and he felt kind of sorry, sorry about it. And he kind of helped me out and this is how I stayed on til the end practically, two months before the war ended. And they took us —

  </p>
  <p id="395">
   A: Yeah but before the war, like four months before it ended they, the Russians were very close because it was close to Leipzig. They decided to evacuate us. And we again went in the train and we are driving around for like three, two, three weeks. Because —

  </p>
  <p id="405">
   A: No, no not at that time. And they didn’t. They tried to make up their mind what to do with us. So finally they decided that we should go down to the krankenlager, to the sick camp. And the sick camp was that you had those German cuts that was like 30 inches wide. Five people were ina cut. And when we came in. We were all like this. But the people in the camp that were there looked worse than we were. So when we came in. When we came into the camp we just asked them how long was that you became you know they looked like you’re going to a doctor and you see a skeleton. They were a skeleton. So we just wanted to find out how long it took them to become skeleton. And luckily it was right towards the end of the war. It was in 45. And it was already 45 in May. We came in.

  </p>
  <p id="433">

They wouldn’t let, they were afraid to let us out. They were afraid that we would kill all the Germans there. So they kept us locked in for quite a while. But we jumped over the fence.
  </p>
  <p id="434">
   Q: What was your health like at that point?
  </p>
  <p id="435">

  <p id="438">
   Q: So you get cleaned up and then what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="439">
   A: I got together with some people, with some young people. I was kind of the youngest always for some reason. Was very few, very few my age so I —
  </p>
  <p id="440">
   Q: But you were still growing even though you didn’t’ have enough food. You were still getting bigger, taller I should say.
  </p>
  <p id="441">
   A: Yeah, yeah I was already like about 14, 15. Yeah. And I have still my teeth, I am so lucky you see that. Well we decided to jump the fence because we didn’t’ like the food.
  </p>
  <p id="442">
   Q: So other teenagers.
  </p>
  <p id="443">
   A: No they were a little bit more than teenagers. They were all in their 20s, middle 20s. that’s the majority that really stayed alive. And I was at that time they called me the kid. And they kind of, I don’t know if they felt sorry for me that they, eventually they left and that’s a different story. But we jumped and we went in there was three or four of us, we went into a German peasant in a little town which was called in a town, the village was called Auw, next to Mauthausen. Maybe three or four kilometers away from Mauthausen. Mauthausen was next to a village, not to atown. The town of Mauthausen was a little bit further down. and we told the woman that we want food and we want a bed to sleep and a place to wash. Well she did give us a place to wash. And we told her what kind of food we want. It was an old lady and she says well I'll give you the food that you want but if you eat that food that you want, you’re going to die. We were underweight and she knew where we came from so she said that’s too fat for you. And this is why we left the camp too because the Americans didn’t’ feed us the proper food. So we said ok give us whatever you have but we’re hungry. And she did. Little by little she gave us food that she felt without fat. And we stayed with her for a few weeks. Until the Russian, we escaped to the Russian side because in Austria we were away, the Russians were quite practically next to, well they were, the Russian army and the American army were kind of together at that time. And just across if you run out from the camp, from Mauthausen, you were on the Russian side. But if you were in the camp, you were on the American side. So we were on the Russian side. And one night the Russians came in, soldiers came in to the apartment and they knew that we speak German. And we told them we don’t speak Russian. We speak Polish. Never mind they said. We want what do you call it, watches. We want rings, we want all kinds of things. So and you tell the Germans what we want. And I said we can’t do that. Said you better do it. So we did it. We went with them. And we walked into their houses and we told them what they want. And the Germans thought that we splitting with them. And we went into one of the houses that the daughter was going out with the commandant, with the main guy, with the Russian. The daughter comes home and she says and the mother tells her that those Jews that live at the neighbors brought the Russians in to rob them. (phone rings) Well the daughter called the Russian that she walked out, that she was going with and that she was, he was, called him or whatever. And told him that the Jews tried to rob her parents. And she didn’t tell him that the Russians tried to rob the parents, but the Jews. So he sends a soldier to tell us you should appear in front of him, 5:00 in the morning. So we thought between us if we appear and wake him up at 5:00 after his binge at night hell shoot us. We decided to run. The woman had two bikes and the neighbor had another two bikes and we told them look we don’t’ want to take it but if you want to give us the bikes because if we don’t I don’t know what’s going to happen. Said ok we don’t care.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: How many of you were there?
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: Four
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: There were four of you.
  </p>
  <p id="447">
   A: So we took the bikes and we started to run all night long and we’re all looking behind us if they’re not chasing us. But it was ok. They did not chase us. We finally found the, came into a little town and the Russians liked the bikes. And they said but I am really too young to ride a bike all the way to Vienna. Just cause we were going to up to Vienna. What do you have in Vienna? I said we might have some relatives. We don’t know. They said ok. Give us the bikes because you are too young to ride bikes to Vienna. It’s too far. We’ll put you on the trains. They wanted the bikes. So they took us to the station and they said wait for a train. The train will come. You go to Vienna. So we gave them the bikes, have no choice. And we waited. And the train came and we went to Vienna.
  </p>
  <p id="448">
   Q: And you just get on the train and then you don’t need tickets or anything?
  </p>
  <p id="449">
   A: No, no there was no tickets in those days. No. Just took a train and we went, came to Vienna. And we came to Vienna. We got off in Vienna so it’s you cannot walk after 10:00 at night. And we are after 10 so they arrest us and we were coming in.
  </p>
  <p id="450">
   Q: Who’s the they?
  </p>
  <p id="451">
   A: The Russians. The soldiers because after that was that you cannot leave your house after 10:00.
  </p>
  <p id="452">
   Q: It was after curfew.
  </p>
  <p id="453">
   A: Curfew yeah. And so we were after the curfew so they took us to the station. And so in the station was a believe it or not a Russian Jewish guy so we spoke in Jewish. He spoke Jewish.
  </p>
  <p id="454">
   Q: He spoke Yiddish.
  </p>
  <p id="455">
   A: Yeah so he decided he’s going to send us to a pensione and see to that we should have food and that helped a lot and this is what we did. (file 2 — RG-50.106.0246.02.02; duration: 22:37) Katie St. John: This is Katie St. John taking over for Gail Schwartz in the interview of Nathan Neiberg on July 24, 2015. So Mr. Neiberg you were telling us that you came to Vienna after the war. So could you tell us a little about that? Nathan Neiberg: Stayed in Vienna of like a couple of weeks the captain of the post in Vienna, the Russian captain of the post in Vienna assigned us a place to stay in a hotel. And he supplied us with food and was very nice to us. After a few weeks I decided to go back to my home town in Poland to see who’s left alive. Being in the station train came in from Poland and as the people walked off the train I recognized a few guys that came back from Poland. And I recognized that the war, during the war in the concentration camps. So I walked up to them and said what’s going on in Poland. And they asked me which town I have come from. And I told them. So they said don’t go to Poland to see who stayed alive because the Poles don’t look at it, don’t look at us welcome. That we should come back there even for a little while. They killed quite a few Jewish guys that came in to see if their parents are alive or somebody stayed alive in the family. So we advise you not to go back to Poland. But if you want to know go to Hungary. And in, there’s quite a few a lot of Polish Jews that went to Hungary after the war. So go to Hungary. Find the, find Budapest. There are camps there. Refugee camps. Inquire there and you’ll know more so there than if you go to Poland, go to your home town. So I decided instead of taking a train to Poland I took a train to Hungary. In those days there were no, you didn’t have to pay for the seats on the train. You just boarded the train and you just went. And this is what I did. I came into Hungary and I didn’t’ meet there people from my own home town. And they in fact they told me that some of your brothers stayed alive too. But they didn’t know where they are or they didn’t’ see them but they heard from other people that they came across that they feel that some of the Neibergs, Neiberg brothers stayed alive. They don’t know which ones. They might have think about me but they didn’t know. So I stayed a while in Budapest. There was a refugee camp in Budapest also. And then there was that they started to form Zionist groups in the refugee camps with the intentions of eventually going to Israel. At that time it was Palestine. It was not Israel yet there.
  </p>
  <p id="456">
   Q: And what were the camps like?
  </p>
  <p id="457">
   A: In Hungary. Decent. Well any place you went after the concentration camps in Germany and throughout the war, once it ended, nothing was in comparison to the concentration camps. So whatever you did, it was always a little better then. So the question 1s that how was it. It was better. But was it good. No, it was just better that you had more food to eat. You weren’t hungry and you had some clean clothes to wear. The rest ok.
  </p>
  <p id="458">
   Q: Is there anything specific that you remember from your time there?
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: From Hungary?
  </p>
  <p id="460">
   Q: From the refugee camp, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="461">
   A: From the refugee. Not really, not really. It was normal you know. As I came, as a refugee camp was, which was mainly that you survived, that you’re not in danger of being killed and being beaten up or had to go to work. To work that was it was a horrible type of work. But anything, you survived in the camps. You couldn’t’ complain for, there was quite a few a lot of refugees that they just welcomed, and they did a decent job at whatever they could. No complaints. And then from, so I joined one of those Zionist groups. And decide that Zionist, the leaders decided that well we it’s time to move on. We left Hungary and strived to reach Italy.
  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: Why Italy?
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: Because from Italy they formed there refugee camps in Italy. That was already refugee camps. And from Italy kind of striving to reach Palestine. That was the last stop before trying to reach Palestine. Or you went to France. But we picked Italy. So to reach Italy we had to go back to Austria. And we came back to Austria we stayed there for again, for like a month and finally the Jewish brigade that was serving the English army they helped the Jewish group, Zionist group reaching Italy with their trucks. It was not legal that they did it but they did it. Then we went through the Alps from Austria to avoid usual borders. Then we reached northern Italy, coming through the Alps. And we were left in Modena, Italy in Modena. It’s close to Bologna kind of. It’s a nice, nice town. And there was also a Jewish refugee camp kind of that they formed. And we stayed in Bologna a while. Then we left Modena to southern Italy which was Santa Maria. You have it in here.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Oh, in the documents.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Yes. And stayed in Santa Maria for a while, naturally with the Zionist groups. And we decided from the Zionist group decided really, the leaders of the Zionist group decided that there was a ship which was called the Moleta and they said that you might leave with that ship. And we left with that ship and we reached Cyprus.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: And why that ship?
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: Well that was available. It was that ship was bought through the Zionist groups through the United States. It was a really a kind of a fishing boat you would say more so. But it was an enlarged fishing boat, a luxury fishing boat kind of. And we left in the at that particular time was the blockade of the British navy that they wouldn’t let the Jews into Israel, to Palestine, I mean. And they used to know the kind of route we took from Italy to Palestine and they were controlling that particular route. And they always used to catch the illegal ships trying to come to Palestine. And we were caught by them and we were brought to Haifa. They took us off from the ships that we came on. They were raiding us. Well we had a light fight with them before they took us, took over the ship. We threw at them rotten tomatoes and they got a little angry with us but it was over and they attached us to their ship and brought us into Haifa. In Haifa we had to leave the ship that we came on and they transferred us to a, to one of their ships. And they took us to Cyprus.
  </p>
  <p id="468">
   Q: And how many other people were you with?
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: I would say another kind of at 100, between 150 to 100 people that we were.
  </p>
  <p id="470">
   Q: And you were all taken to Cyprus?
  </p>
  <p id="471">
   A: Correct yes and we were taken to Cyprus and must be familiar with Cyprus Camps right. Ok so we stayed in Cyprus for quite a while. From Cyprus when they declared the state of Israel naturally they let us go to come into Israel at that time. And —
  </p>
  <p id="472">
   Q: While you were in Cyprus what were you doing?
  </p>
  <p id="473">
   A: While Cyprus was a camp that you just were imprisoned. We were not doing anything really. Except we were doing you know in groups things to send out great teachers from Palestine and we used to study the Bible, all these, all kinds of lessons. There was kind of like a formed school that whoever wanted to attend was welcome there. This was the major things that we did. There was no work to be done. Yeah there was work that we all had to day, give a day in the kitchen about wash dishes or something of that nature so we all always were available if they needed some people but as far as really working, there was no work.
  </p>
  <p id="474">
   Q: Just focusing on your education.
  </p>
  <p id="475">
   A: Correct. Just on education and English supplied the food and it was ok. Can’t complain that they didn’t gas or beat you up there. It was normal way of life, a normal way of life in the camp. Being imprisoned. And naturally we stayed in Cyprus, the Jewish group, in that camp until they declared the state of Israel. Soon as they declared the state of Israel, they all let us out. Not out, they I think the Israeli formed government sent ships to bring us back to Israel. Not back but to bring us to Israel.
  </p>
  <p id="476">
   Q: Were there any kind of big celebrations in the camp?
  </p>
  <p id="477">
   A: Oh absolutely. Oh yes, great celebrations. Great everybody was just like in heaven. Then after those celebrations the ship came to pick us up. Came in but naturally the majority of us who wanted to been to a kibbutz or just do whatever you want to do. But the majority was we all went in the army. And til the war ended and we became really a country. Then this was the end of it.
  </p>
  <p id="478">
   Q: From there, when did you decide to come to the U.S.?
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: Well I had two brothers here and a sister. And they really wanted, they wanted me to join them which I wasn’t too happy to leave Israel. I liked where I was. I was doing pretty well there. But eventually they convinced me that we should be together. So I had to decide. They were, I was the youngest so I thought they kind of, and I this is when I decided to come to the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="480">
   Q: About what year was that?
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: 52. Right after the war of the independence, when the war of independence ended. When I got out from the army at that time.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: So you were out from the army maybe deciding what to do next and that’s when —
  </p>
  <p id="483">
   A: Well I was working already there in Israel.
  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: And what were you doing?
  </p>
  <p id="485">

  </p>
  <p id="489">

  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: What was it like seeing your siblings again?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: It was great, it was great together with my family. Eventually got married. And had three kids and one of them is sitting right behind me, my daughter. Now she has kids. And that’s what I did.
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: My last question to you would be is there anything that you didn’t get a chance to talk about. You want to —
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: No as I think about it, I can send it or something about it. Right?
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: We can record it right now if
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: No that’s about, that’s about it. Man (asks question): The period of time from when you went to Israel and then, your train —

  </p>
  <p id="497">
   Q: If you’d like to tell us a little bit about that.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   A: Well we had to go into the army, it was no question about it. we were all healthy by that time. We recoup from the camps and so we been coming to Israel. We were all over 18 already. I think. And we went, I went into the army and stayed in the Army for a while and by luck they took me into the Navy for a while. So I stayed in the after, stayed in the Navy for most of my being in the Army really. And
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   Q: And why the switch from Army to Navy?
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   A: Well I you know when I was in Italy I did go a little bit to school in Italy. And it was the maritime school, scholastic school in Ancona. SO [had kind of like a test which the Army knew about and they needed people that had some type of a, a little education about it so they really picked me and they felt since we haven’t got too many Jewish sailors and you had a little bit of schooling about it. So they just picked me and I joined the Navy.
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   Q: And so what did they have you doing in the Navy?
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   A: Well I started off as a regular sailor and then I was promoted to be the boson. Boson meant to be the head of the sailors. Kind of, it was a kind of a little rank. And stayed there like well I volunteered for an additional year while I was there. What was my time for, to get out of it was, they asked me if I wanted to stay for an additional year. I said well I signed for an additional year. They said, I liked it. And then once the year elapsed, I got into the civilian life and that was it. Became you know in the again worked in the administration in the port of Haifa until I came to the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   Q: Is there anything specific from the war of independence you’d like to include?
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   A: Well it was the war like any other war. You know. it’s nothing special. You got your you know maneuvers and fightings but I was in the Army. The Navy saw very little fightings. Because it was skirmishes but nothing special. Just watched the borders. The water borders on the Mediterranean.
