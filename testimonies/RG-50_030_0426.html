I was singing 1n the hall, but I every time wished to sing the solo, this In-ka (ph) and what happens is that there are two In-ka's (ph) and I told to Mr. Froenfeld (ph), "oh, I know it", and he read to me, to do it twice, without rehearsals, I did it.

   A: Well I think they only wanted us to work hard. There was never a day, they think it was so hard and so frozen, these airs, and we had to, what we dig we had to give it one, on a place, and after we had to continue.

  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: She got the paper that she has to go. And I went with her nearly to the train. I gave her these nice boots because they were very warm for winter. These people who were shouting before war, "give, you pig, give me your boots!", I gave it to my sister. But she couldn't have it because she had to give everything, she had to leave everything there.

   Q: Was your mother nearby at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Yes, but only I went with my sister because it was not so easy. It was forbidden to go and I came, I went with her to the last place I could. Because it was danger that they will take me also. And I had to stay with my parents, they were older, and so.

  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: How were you able to help each other in the home?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: We were together cleaning. When somebody was sad, we were speaking to him. We were trying to make jokes. Everybody who needs everything we do, we did, we were dreaming together. For example, a friend of mine, she's living now in Vienna, and she wrote a diary, the film was done, about it, and we were many, many evenings sitting together and we were dreaming. I wanted to study music at the conservatory and she wanted to study acting. And we were thinking endlessly about how it will be nice when we will be back home and we will be together.
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: So you all talked about what would happen in the future?
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Yes, we were thinking of the future because the present time, it was not so sure for us, we didn't know, for example, when my friends went to , | have some letters from them, and they were writing me letters. And we didn't know if we will see each other. And one friend of mine was writing me and, oh, when I will sign, I will write to you a letter from this place where I will be, but when I will sign that I am "Mil-ka" (ph), sincerely yours, Mil-ka (ph). I am in good place. But when I will sign "I am your Milshka (ph), it is a bad place. Such, we were thinking, but she never wrote me and she never came back.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: But you all thought that you would get through this?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Yes, I don't know why I didn't get a paper that I have to go to . I think that it was this, that everybody, every girl, nearly everybody that was born 1930 was sending to , but when we arrived to Terezin my mother wrote me, wrote into the paper and said that I was born in 1931. In this time, I was very angry because I was in the, I was a girl, I wanted to be older, no, I'm not younger, but maybe it saved my life. I don't know, it may be. We stayed only four, from our room, to the end of the Terezin-schatz (ph). Everybody from us went to . And we were, maybe, with these changes, we were maybe about 150 or more, only four we stayed in Terezin until the end. But now, after 40 years, we found each other and we are living ten, alive, in America, in Vienna, in Israel, in Czech Republic and in Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: After your sister left, did a lot of people leave at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: Yes, yes. It was nearly every two or three days they were transported... End of Tape 1. Tape 2
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Question: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   Answer: Yes, nearly, I remember that nearly every two or three days in one time there were transports to and also my sister went. I told you, and many, many of my friends. They wrote me five letters and I have them and I copied it for museum in the and I will copy it also in the Holocaust Museum in Washington because they are, you can have the feeling, you can read what we felt in this time. That we were very sad and that we liked each other and we were not sure that we will see each other again.
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: How did you know they were, where they were going to?
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: Oh, we didn't know. It was not sure, but somebody told us that it was ; somebody told us after, they would say they were gassed rooms and they were killed. Somebody came after, at the end of the war, a little earlier, they had told it to us, but we were not sure.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: As time went on, did the security, the guards and everything, did that become more strict or less strict?
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: I think that it was, 1n one time it was more strict. But when it was nearly end of war I went to the place where people in very bad health came to Terezin. I was waiting my friends, I was waiting my sister, | was waiting my brother, and I was staying there hours and hours. And I never forget this unhappy people who had not strength to walk or had not strength to live and we were helping there and giving them something, what we have, and we found, also, some friends from us, or we talked to neighbors, "oh, your relative is here, please go and treat him". But my sister didn't come. We got only a letter that she's alive, that she's very ill, that she's in Bergen- Belsen and after she went to and some English soldiers liberated her and an English doctor saved her life because she was very, very ill. And for many, many years, for about 40 years, I didn't like to think about it because after war, when I came home, I wanted to live normal. I didn't want to speak with many people about what happened to us. Also, some people told us, "oh, why came you back, why didn't you stay there", and it was very painful. I didn't like for 40 years to think very deeply about it because every time, when I started to think and to talk about what happened to us and to my friends and to my relatives, I was really ill about it. I was so, trembling and I wanted to live normal and to study normal and to work good, but something stayed. For example, I was so happy to be able to study, that they allowed me to study, that when I had students which didn't work, I was nearly furious. I told them, "How you can dare not to work? You don't know that people, children or young people, couldn't learn anything, that they were in concentration camps", and so on. And this was a very strong feeling for me because I was, everyday telling, thank you that I can live a normal life. And because I was every time so excited that, in that way about it, when I was speaking with somebody, I wanted to, didn't want to speak too much about it and I didn't visit Terezin 40 years after the war. And after the 40 years I found the strength and I went there with my son and it was very good that I went because I saw a nearly normal village. In the home where we were living, nobody wrote that we, that they were sometimes almost starving children and that this happened and this happened. And after, I told to me, oh, you cannot thinking in this way, you have to be quiet and only you can work for the future. That never will the same thing will happen to children and to people. And for this reason I am working in Terezin, 1n it's archive, in Prague, and I'm working also in my town, Berno (ph), in the staff of Jewish society.

And we would like that everybody can read these things, maybe it will, we will have good conditions to bring to it.
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: So after you went out, where did you go? When you left the children's home?
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: After I went with my parents into this military , and I am not sure if 1t was Bergem-Bach (ph) or Magdeburg, but I think that 1t was Magdeburg and we had a very small piece and we were living there. It was a room divided and we had maybe, I don't know how many meters, three meters, and we were living there. And once it happened that I was alone at home and that I was cleaning the window, I was staying in the window, and one man came. I thought it was an SS man, it was Mr. Mumelstein (ph) and he came and he kick to the door and he was shouting a little bit on me and looking not in very good way of me and I was, I had some minutes of, I was very afraid that he will throw me from the window, from the second floor down. But, in one moment, he turned and he went and it was not very nice.

  <p id="247">
   A: No, besides with this counting in this Bolshevik (ph) when we stayed there a whole day, it was very bad. And every transport was a very, very bad experience for us because we have to say farewell to people which were, who were for us very, very dear and we didn't know if we will see them and this was very hard. And we were afraid that everyday we will, we were on the row and we will go. And we felt that it was not a good place where the SS go.

   Q: Okay. Do you remember the Red Cross visit?
  </p>
  <p id="257">
   A: Yes, I remember. Because we had the SS, , and he gave us to eat and we had to tell him, " , ", "again we have sardines", and so it was like for , religious. And they built shops and café houses and in these shops we got also tickets that we can shop all money, we had also money, that we can buy there, but nothing was there, only I remember and some things like this, but we didn't, we couldn't buy because nothing was there. It was only like for this , this villages. And when the Red Cross came, then we had to clean everything and they chose also children, they looked well, they didn't, they were not too slim, and it was like a theater, like a spectacle. And we got a piece of bread and we were eating and like this. In film you can also see it.
  </p>
  <p id="258">
   Q: This must have seemed strange to you?

  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: What else do you remember about Terezin?
  </p>
  <p id="263">
   A: I remember only that I was happy that we could leave. I was happy that my brother came to Terezin in the uniform of U.S. Army because when he flew from this, when they moved from the Malyy-Trostenetz concentration camp and when the war was ended, and he got, I don't know how, to the U.S. Army because he was speaking very well English, he was helping, and he came to, with the U.S. Army to Czech country and then it was only possible, he came to look if we are alive. And I was the first, I saw him. And I was so happy! And after we got a letter from my sister, and it was also nice, and after we were looking forward to the time when we can leave. But the people who went, who came back from other concentration camps were in such bad health that I never forget these people. How they came, because they were exhausted and I think after some days they wouldn't want to be alive.
  </p>
  <p id="264">
   Q: I read that the people who lived in Terezin-stat were able to get food packages from around the world. Is that true? Did you have enough food?
  </p>
  <p id="265">
   A: One time it was possible, but we didn't have anybody to send us something.
  </p>
  <p id="266">
   Q: Maybe Jewish organizations, or?
  </p>
  <p id="267">
   A: Nobody. I think it was so many people that it was not possible. And these Jewish organizations, they are also dying. Only when somebody was from, maybe a Christian woman and a Jewish father and children, maybe she, they were both in Prague or another town, and she could send something. It was something, possible, but also we got a letter from my sister, we got a letter to Terezin. But it was only a card, that she's alive. But nothing more.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: Did you have radios?
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: No, we had to give everything. And 1n this time, I think the small radios were not yet.
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   Q: Did you have any knowledge about what was going on with the war and the camps and all that?
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: Yes, yes, yes. We had to because people were speaking about it. I don't know how they could have it, but I can tell you that when we were liberated, we were inside when the guns were working, when we were liberated I, every time I was dreaming, how I was happy. How I will be jumping when the liberation will be. I can tell you that I was so exhausted that I couldn't feel the real happiness. After a long time, I could feel it. And my brother wrote a poem about it and it express also my feelings, also when we were in another place. Because I cannot translate it to you. I am liberated with, 1t was asking, yes? Can I live as before? It was too much. I went through so many hard and difficult situations that it will take me a long time if I can be, I can feel that I am liberated, I am a human being, I can live normal. It is inside me and it 1s like a stone, yes? And I could feel, I was a child, I was not yet 15, I was 14-years-old and I can tell you that I couldn't be so happy. I was so exhausted from this waiting and waiting and seeing what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="272">
   Q: At the time of liberation, and you were liberated by what army?
  </p>
  <p id="273">
   A: By Russian army and English. The English were a little less, but English soldiers were there. I can remember it.
  </p>
  <p id="274">
   Q: What happened?
  </p>
  <p id="275">
   A: They came. First we were hidden. After, when it was, a little quiet we came out and they were singing. We were thanking them and after we were looking what to do. What to have to eat. What to, because after this we had to take care about ourselves alone.
  </p>
  <p id="276">
   Q: So they didn't stay very long?
  </p>
  <p id="277">
   A: Oh, they stayed. They stood, I think, the whole time. Because after I went towards the sanatorium, I cannot tell you everything because I was one months out from Terezin.
  </p>
  <p id="278">
   Q: So you left very soon after the liberation?
  </p>
  <p id="279">
   A: Yes. It was, I cannot tell, it was some days, it was maybe 14 days after this liberation because it was this very dangerous typhus and it was not good, the children stay there, and after they had passed, and after, although my father organized his life after liberation, he took care about food and about helping people and also medical care started. Because it was necessary.
  </p>
  <p id="280">
   Q: When you left for the sanitartum, were you at all scared about leaving your parents at this point?
  </p>
  <p id="281">
   A: A little bit, but we went with other children and it was first time we can get out! To anew life, to a nice nature, it was something like paradise!
  </p>
  <p id="282">
   Q: How long did you stay, after you came back from the sanitarium, how long did you stay at Terezin before you left?
  </p>
  <p id="283">
   A: Not too long, I think about in June, maybe also 14 days or so. I know that in June we got, we came back to our town, to Berno (ph), and we had to start a new life. It was not so easy because we didn't have money. Our fate was not free, and we got only 500 crowns and from U.S. Army, said, oh, we could go somewhere to eat something, but we couldn't eat because our stomachs were not use to eat too much and we had some difficulties. Now I started to look, what shall I study? And I forgot nearly everything from my knowing to play piano and I wanted to go to conservatory and I was looking for it to work very hard to again do exam. It lasted one year. I had to do exams from the normal school because I didn't have schools, yes? And I can tell you that in Terezin, we had so good professors. I had good marks, only I studied only mathematics, math. And I got through. The life was hard, but I was so drinking the life that I was attending, for example, cinema. At four o'clock, six o'clock and eight o'clock! But I didn't know what it was because there were three films, but I had to live. I wanted to live and funny things I did, such un-normal things.
  </p>
  <p id="284">
   Q: Did your family have any question about going back to the Czech Republic?
  </p>
  <p id="285">
   A: My family had to go because my parents were a little bit older and not healthy. My father was without his right hand and we tried to start this normal life. But my brother left for America, he couldn't study more, he had before war, before concentration camp and he couldn't leave and he went for America when it was possible. And my sister, second sister was living in Israel and my second sister, this dancer, she was so ill after the war, she had tuberculosis, she was in sanatorium. We couldn't leave it. I wanted to go to Israel but I couldn't do it because my parents were alone and they are not so strong and my sister was so ill. I started to study and stayed here.
  </p>
  <p id="286">
   Q: Now when you went back to Bruno (ph), you said somebody else was in your flat?
  </p>
  <p id="287">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="288">
   Q: Did you try to get it back?
  </p>
  <p id="289">
   A: We tried, but we found one floor near, lower. We found a flat, 1t was empty because they were Germans. And we could go there. We could find our piano after many months. And we could live in this flat, but we had to pay, furniture, not too much, but it was so hard for us. My father had to borrow money from bank and had to start to a new life and he started to work and to build his shop again. But, when he gave back this money, it was three years, it lasted three years. And when he gave back, after we started to live a little bit normal, Communists came to us and he had to close his shop. And it was very hard for him. But we had to live.
  </p>
  <p id="290">
   Q: What about your former neighbors? How did they treat you when you came back? Were they happy to see you?
  </p>
  <p id="291">
   A: Somebody was happy, somebody was not happy. I told you that some also, one mother of my school mate, she told me, "why did you return? Why didn't you stay there?" And, "this was not normal girl", and "everybody was laughing about her", and before war, I was the one, I was every time telling, "why you are laughing? She cannot, she is a poor girl", and as to things we had hidden by our neighbors, nearly everybody told us that they had bombs and they have nothing more. And we got only one small thing, one small statue from the house from my mother, it was remembering her house, and she was happy. But we didn't care about what we have because it was not the important thing. The important thing was that we were free, that we could live, we could work, and I could study. And we could take a little care about, to improve our health.
  </p>
  <p id="292">
   Q: How important was religion to you, during Terezin and afterwards?
  </p>
  <p id="293">
   A: I can tell you that I lost my religion in Terezin because I was praying for my friends and nothing happened. And I was quarreling with the God. And asking Him, "why he is so cruel and he let these things to work?" No, He didn't answer me. For this reason, I only was feeling that I am a member of a group of people that had the same destiny, and I was proud of this big tradition, this old tradition. I was proud that I was a Jewish and I told everybody that I am Jewish, but I didn't practice the religion. After, when my father died, I came a little bit back.
  </p>
  <p id="294">
   Q: Did you ever resent being Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="295">

  </p>
  <p id="298">
   Q: What kept you strong?
  </p>
  <p id="299">
   A: I think it was a school of life, what got us through. And when we could live like this, we had to be strong. And we learned to live in bad conditions and try to be happy with small things. We, I think that it was a, so good school that, also, after the war, the life was not every time so easy. That we could go through a little bit lighter than other people. Because we had harder times.

  </p>
  <p id="300">
   Q: You were saying that, for those of you who survived camps, life afterwards, you handled it differently than other people?
  </p>
  <p id="301">
   A: Yes. We had a strong will. We wanted to leave and we were working very hard and we wanted to, what we couldn't do in the concentration camp, we wanted to do everything better and we were very, very, very hard working. Because it was not so easy for us who didn't have schools, although when we read something, but it was not everything. And we had to run, to run very quickly to do everything in time.
  </p>
  <p id="302">
   Q: You valued life more?
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   A: Yes, yes, everything. Everything was nice for us and for everything to be thanked in our soul.
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   Q: When you think about how your life has developed for the last fifty years, can you talk about the impact that those early years had on the choices you made?
  </p>
  <p id="305">
   A: Now, I don't understand.
  </p>
  <p id="306">
   Q: I'm asking if, these early experiences had to have effected the way you've lived you're life later. You started to talk about that, are there other things in terms of a choice you made or the way you raised you're son, or?
  </p>
  <p id="307">
   A: Yes, yes. I think we were, we developed our personality in another way if, when or if we lived a normal way. And everything was, every time I was comparing. Yes. Also, with my students, I told you that I was very strong and very serious. They had to work hard and they needed to be honest and to be helpful and to be deeper, to be deep. Not only to do it, everything so. I think I was also, not only a professor of music, but I was like a mother or aunt, and I think that they were also, they work and they laugh for this, what they did. They were a little bit deeper. It was somebody or couldn't be deep, but mostly they were.
  </p>
  <p id="308">
   Q: When you were talking about that poem, that liberation, you said there was a line, like, "Can we live as before?"
  </p>
  <p id="309">
   A: Yes. It was the first time, we were living a little bit in the past, and we were trying not to live. It was also, it needed to have strength. And not to feel that our body was weak and we had difficulties. We wanted to work as nothing happened and we wanted to forget. And it, the cost was of, many great strength and a great fear. But we did it. I could study, I had a degree. I did, twice, conservatory. Not only once, I did as a pianist, after as a singer. After I did High School and I think I reached everything what a normal, grown, talented human being could reach.
  </p>
  <p id="310">
   Q: Do you think you were robbed of your childhood in any way?
  </p>
  <p id="311">
   A: Yes, but it had to be and I think that, I was richer in this way, that I could have after. I could, everything, for everything be thankful and I was, I cannot say it, I could have a real friendship, a deep friendship, and everything what I had, it was a little bit, it was everything more truthful.
  </p>
  <p id="312">
   Q: One more question. When you think back, as I'm sure you do?
  </p>
  <p id="313">
   A: Sometimes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="314">
   Q: Are there certain images that come back to you?
  </p>
  <p id="315">
   A: Yes, yes. They are, and also when we meet together with my friends who came back, we were speaking about our life in concentration camp, but we don't like to speak about the bad things. We were only speaking, not only sometimes, also, but we were, we are speaking about good things, what we did, about the life there, about helping each other, about friendship, about these girls who didn't come back and what we can do that they are not so forgotten. We will do that, we will bring the book, we will write about it. I think many books are now here. The museum is full of new books. I was there. But, I think that somebody who will read it, it is our duty to write it.
  </p>
  <p id="316">
   Q: Is there one image that haunts you?
  </p>
  <p id="317">
   A: Yes. I think. And the other images that, I have to do something that nothing will come back, that these bad things, they will never come back. And also I can tell you, everything what I did, I was doing, I tried to do good and well because I was a member of a nation who was, I cannot tell, haunted, yes? And that many gospels were about us and I wanted to show that I am a normal human being. That I can do good work, that I am a good, I was trying to me to be good, to do the right things. That nobody can say, "Oh, look, this is a Jew and Jews are bad people". And I was not working for me, my and everything what I did, I did in, as I am delegate of all Jews.

  <p id="318">
   Q: Do you have a sense of security today?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="320">
   Q: Is there anything else you want to say?

  <p id="321">
   A: No. Only I can say that I was visiting here in this museum that's, I can tell thank you for it. It is good, very good done. It is simple, it is human, it is not show. Every soul who is able to feel, I think that everybody can have an impression of what happened and that I wish that everybody who is through to see it, that will be in his life a good person and say, don't alive these persons, allow, that don't allow these things to be repeated.
