And she — she remember, you know, the wealth and all the happiness pre — pre-war. So affect her much more than a — than affects me, because I was un — no conscience about my — my own existence
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: [indecipherable] I did. On — on the age of two, two and a half already, or a little bit more, I don’t know, 19 — 1942, when the first transport of people have been taken from the Warsaw ghetto to extermination camp, in that — in that transport went my family; my — my — my parent — my — o-on both sides, for the exception of the — my — my mother’s brother, one of them have been killed. I don’t know if that’s by an accident or what, he be — was a fire on the roof in — in the ghetto. He went up to the roof, but never came back. He was 25. His name was Ignatius. And the youngest brother my — of my mother’s, Henry. He was 18 and he — he took poison, he killed himself. But he was in the underground, the organization, had been November 8, 2008 caught, so in order to avoid, you know, further consequences, he did that. I — Miriam, his younger sister, she had been taken to the — to the extermination camp with my — with my grandmother, who at that time was fift — 52 years old. And my mother was a widow on the age — age of 30. 30? Thir — 31 - 32.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: So, after the war started, what ha — what had happened to your family? Did they try to escape Warsaw, or —
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: No, when my mother — my mother — my mother before the war was always advising to leave to South America, because a cous — my ma — my — my — my grandma cousin, first cousin was living in Buenos Aires and did well. So sa — always like a possibility which my mother always considered in the thir — in the late 30s. But my — my father was too attached to, you know, position, he wa — the business was going well, and you know. They thought the war — nothing will happens, you know, so he was optimistic. So they never fled away. And once was the war start, like everybody else, we — we have to move into the ghetto. And the reason why my mom were not ta-taken and myself, and my sister, we were the three survivors, is because we didn’t live in the same place where my grandmothers live and the family. And me — my — my father, the older men of the family, he — he was there with — with the rest when they close and they ah — they emptied the building and took everybody away. So, my mom was — when she said well — she wa — she November 8, 2008 didn’t — she didn’t have any doubts that this is not for taking her to the working camps, that was for extermination. So she says, I am not waiting here for — for death, I am — I am running away. If I will be caught on the — on the run, at least I tried to do something for my life. So she — you know, was corruption, like everywhere else. So she — she paid the people to let us go, and they supposed to supply us with documents, aray — Aryan documents on the other side. They — they didn’t follow to do that, they send us a Gestapo. So, my mother was waiting and that took her a little bit more than she — sh-she — es — expect to take. So she was very am — you know, nervous and watching if the people are coming and bringing the document. And then sh-she showed me the Gestapo car coming. So from the — from the back of the building we run away, just in time. So s — as — close calls like this, we had a couple of them. Even when we was trying to leave Poland after the war, where the — the Iron Curtain was established by the Russians. So, in order to get out of Poland to the western Germany was a ri — also risking a life. But coming back to those times — so we — we left — we left the ghetto, and my mother remember from her young age that her father was taking the family to spend the summer to a place called Sandomierz on the south — on — a — a little bit south of Warsaw on the bank of the Wista river. And so sh — in order to run from Warsaw, she went there with us. And that was a mistake, because in a small place, ou-ou-outside there is November 8, 2008 noticeable immediately. So, very, very short time after, we were on our way back to Warsaw. And of course those — those voyages cost money, and we — we didn’t have too man — too much of it. So shortly after bri — getting back to Warsaw, her economical resources had been exhausted, and was not much to do, so she just present herself to a friend of her, made from school, from the elemental school, a Christian lady who was married to a policeman, also Polish. And she says, well, if you refuse to help me, I understand. It’s a big risk. But 1f you can’t, I have no one to call any more, you know. So — and she, she did so. She said, wait. She hold us all the day there until the fire — the husband comes from work, and then she spoke to him by herself. And he comes convince by her — his wife, to help us. And they advise — the plan when he — what he comes with was the following. My sister, she was a blonde with blue eyes, that’s no problem. And — so she went to a — with — with — were nuns.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: The con — the convent?
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: Con-Convent.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: My mom, he brought her a false document, put her fa — photography in that, somebody who was deceased, more or less on the same age. The name was Wovataska(ph) Janina(ph). And on these papers she should volunteer to work in November 8, 2008 Germany. And this way, according to him, she would survive. And I was the problem, being circumci — and he knew a place where he can take me, but the condition was, to take kids there — so the kids who have no one, the orphans, abandoned.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Mm-hm. Mm, right.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: So — because for security reasons, no visits, nobody coming, nobody know.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: So that — that was a condition for this. So he said to my mom, leave — the kids have t — the kid had to be left in the corner of the street where I am due, where I am there, it’s — it’s my — my place to work, no? And my mother couldn’t do that. Well, she had — didn’t have a heart to do that, so my poor sister have to di — do this for. So
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: And — and your sister was how old at this point?
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: She was — she was at that time, she was nine. So, she had to leave me in the corner and w — and, you know, just grab the first streetcar passing by, that what she did. And I almost get her in, because I started to screaming myself. My sister [indecipherable]. People start to surround me and the policeman comes and he took me, and [indecipherable] the people were, you know, that why [indecipherable] and the place called Klarasebo(ph) in the out-outskirts of November 8, 2008 Warsaw, not far from Warsaw, very close to Wilarnow, which is the — the — the — that was the — the summer palace of the k — the king of Poland in other times. And the convent where I went to, that was a Methodist, it’s not Catholic, it was Methodist. So, being Protestants, you know, the Germans didn’t bother them, they thou — they thought they are part of them —
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: — right? Mas — or were more affinity. The woman who look after us, after the kids inside, were all Jewish womens. Yeah, for security reasons, you know, so that’s no — nobody would denounce, you know. Were personally interested, right? In that’s time I had two years and two months in that time, when I get separate from my mom. And in — in 1946 in — in April — no, in April of you — April, end of April, my mom found us, my sister and me, in a — and a ga — in a — 1n a Jewish orphanage. That was after the war, in Otwock. And that’s 30 kilometers southeast of Warsaw, on the eastern bank of the — of the river. In 1945, when the Germans start to retreat, obviously my sister said something which guides the people who are trying to put the families together, because they knew about this organization, and — and in no time I have been bring fr — brought from that place to — to the place where my sister was. But I was not the only kid, so m-many of them, so I think they was just putting the Jew — Jewish kids together. So maybe my — my sister didn’t say tha — nothing, I November 8, 2008 don’t know. So, we were taken to Otwock. And well, I survived this way, and I s — when my mom comes, I was just re — convalescing from, I don’t know, one of those, you know, kids things, measles or something like that. So I—I was separate from the rest of the kids, in order to avoid possible, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Contamination, right.
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: — epidemics, yeah, right, right. So the lady who was looking after me, her name was Dora, she — she ask me to [indecipherable] that’s the — this Polish version of my name, yeah. Said, do you know what — who 1s this lady? And I wa — I look on her, I remember I [indecipherable] a moment, no, and I said, well, that’s my mom. And my da— my mother start to cry.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: It’s okay, take your time.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: Crazy. Said, what happened to her, what’s wrong with her? I couldn’t understand why she’s crying, you know? Well, I was too small to measure the time and emotions and things like that. And th — since then my life changed. So, after that we tried to escape from Poland, and we managed to do that. My mom was a very brave woman, you know. Brave, have guts more than one man — man who would like to have it. And so we — we escaped from Poland, three — four of us. Was my — the three of, my mother, my sister, me, plus a young woman, she was 24 at that time, Maryla(ph) — I don’t recall her last name now, from Wroclaw. She joined because November 8, 2008 she was a daughter of an officer who was a s — immediate superior to my father av — my — my — my mother comes back to Poland, she was remarried.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: And she remarried a Polish man who was in the service, in the — when the — when the troops occupied Germany, defeat Germany, had been occupied by the alliances, so he was part of the — of the occupation troop. And he was in the — in RAF in England, the Polish squadron, and so the — she remarried him. He was a very, very good man, he was a excellent stepfather for me. Stepfather sounds bad, was a good father, I mean. And — but he was not Jewish, he was Christian, so I didn’t live — grow in the Jewish environment with its relations and everything else, I have been deprived from that, all this.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Let me —
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: In 1946, in oc — in octo — October, he had been transfer to England, and with him, of course, the family. So — and also they say, was the kind of person, he says, well, we are — 1f we’re going to be a family, one family, let’s have one surname, so he adopt us both. My daughter — my sister and me. And in October of the same year, we were in o — already in England, was an entirely different life. And we stay in England until 1949, and my parents decide for Argentina. So we emigrate to Argentina in 1949. So the — wha — first, second and third grade, I made it in November 8, 2008 England, and through grade four I went, 1-in sp — in Spanish in Buenos Aires. Well, and I studied in Spanish and I lived there until I reached the age of 38. Of course, I get married in the meantime to a Italian girl, a schoolmate, my schoolmate, and we had four wonderful daughters. I lost my wife 10 years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: I’m sorry.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: And I have six grandchildren. And when this congress had a place in — in — in Toronto, completely by chance, somebody who I knew who was living in the — in massa — who lives in Massachusetts, called me by phone and said, oh listen, on so and so date, I — I’m going to — we are going to be in Toronto, herself and her husband. So we will like invite you for a dinner Friday with us. And maybe you’re daughter and your s-son-in-law can join us. So I said, well, I’m answering by myself because I am no — I have no commitment, will be a pleasure, and about them I have to find out, I don’t know. They may be coming to something else —
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: — maybe they can. And that’s — really, that what happens, they couldn’t attend, so I went by myself. So we — we tal — we talk about different things and finally comes a topic, what brought you to Toronto? And so she mentioned that she is coming to a congress of the hidden children [indecipherable] hidden children of [indecipherable]. What is this? She said, oh, you know, the kids, you know, were November 8, 2008 hidden and — you know, on the Christian houses or here and there, and they — and the — in the churches. Say, I fit perfectly to this category. So — so I get interested, and that was my fir — first attendance, no re — with no registration, because I learned the — the same day, or very — very same day about.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: Next day was starting day, the — the congress. So I went there. I met lots of people, different people from different places, and I learn about some — I — I meet some people who were in Otwock at the same time I were. Of course, now I — now I remember the [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Because I was in the youngest group. But some — some of the people I met, they do remember my sister, who was seven years older than me.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: And so after that, I re — I was very excited about that, and I called my nephew. Okay, I have to tell you my sister passed away very young, on the age of 46, that was in 1979. So, I called my — my nephew, and I mention to him that I — because I knew always [indecipherable] he was very curious about where he is coming from and whatever, but hi — his story [indecipherable] story. But, you know, my sister as well, she didn't have a chance — she was never in the Jewish environment. She November 8, 2008 married to a very nice person, but he was a Christian from the — from Pomerania. That’s the northern part of Poland, right on the sea, on the Baltic. A very handsome, nice fellow, so they were — were okay, but the — the tr — all the tradition and everything what could be, have been lost. So, somehow we were lost for the Jewish community, right? But my s — nephew always was curious about that, and that was something which, for obvious reasons, my sister didn’t talk about that.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: Because she was hidden, her br — her origin, as my mother did. As long my mother lived, I never mention my origin. I respect her will because listen, I don’t know what she went through, what she passed, what make her decide to take this — to decide that. So I were — I were no one to challenge her decision, so I accept it like this. Once — once before, she was still alive, I come to the dilemma, what shall I do? If I shall say to my kids that I am Jewish or not? And that was — ma — ma — my — my — my daughter was like — my older daughter was like 10 years old, and the next one was almost nine. And my mother says, you know, this is something, it’s a big question. I’m not in position to tell you what to do. And after, you know, a—a pause, she said, if you want to save them — to save them suffering, don’t say it.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Wow. November 8, 2008
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: That was what she told me. But I — I— I—I-— you know, I kept thinking about it, and finally I told the decision to say it, because in [indecipherable] maybe by ignorance, some of our — my kids be in the environment where they will come to be a — maybe anti-Semitic or something like this. That’s what’ll be the worst thing what could happen to me right now. So I said that, and that was the time when my — my wife learned about my [indecipherable]. And I said, well, don’t — you don’t have to worry about, because according to the Christian religion, I am a Christian, never mind ho — how my person 1s. I have been Christian, I still am Christian. But I don’t want to deny it, where I’m coming from, and it’s nice to be able to say the truth. So that’s was years ago, and then once ma — I had contact with Jews in my trade, because I was in the fur business. And I’d just been exporting fur from Argentina to Europe [indecipherable] when I matured to do that, before I was a furrier, then I come to be a wholesaler, and then I comes to be an exporter. But the people who I knew and I was dealing with almost on the daily basis, most of them were Jews. Some of them, they come to be very close friends of mine. People much mature, 30 years older than me. So they — they — they — they lived this period of the Holocaust entirely differently than I did. They were fi — 16 - 17, you know, young people, o-or 30 —
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Right. November 8, 2008
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: — when you — when I born. So — and sh — well, make — always, you know, exchanging point of view ideas and histories and so in — and that was something which was eating me up, you know, because on the one side I were so close to them, and I want to be one of them. And that was the Polisher, because I speak very good Polish, and I never learned to speak Yiddish, unfortunately, so well, that’s life. I lived the way I could.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: And at this stage of my life, since they to — the when — since, I think was 2001 or 2002, when this pi — this — this congress and wa — in Toronto has place. So when I call my — my — my nephew, and I told him that I met people from the place I have been in Poland, in the orphanage, and I mention the place, Otwock, say well, you know, I — looking through the papers, Mommy ple — papers, I find the pho —-a—a picture, a photo, and on the — on the reverse says, something written, in Otwock, 1945. Said, can I have this picture or the copy of it? Copy it on both sides. And he did so an-and — and send it to me immediately. Very diligent, cause I spoke to him Thursday and Monday I had the photo in Toronto. And he lives in San Francisco, so for a freight express, immediately. And, in the photograph it was three young girls, and two little boys, one of them were myself, and — and bres to another boy like this, sitting the front, and three girls standing in the back. So also, after the November 8, 2008 congress in Toronto, some of the people I met there, they invite me to have a tea in the house, that’s all, to get closer. And one of the ladies, who is 10 years older than me, she is almost 80, she is eight — 79. Very nice person. I was in her house, made a mention about this photography and I brought that with me, the copy. And she say, one — one second. She went, and she brought the album, and had the same photography made, because the one who was making the photos was her brother, her older brother. He — he was a, you know, he was an amateur, he likes to make photos, and he was the one who make this photo. So in — so she says, you know, this one, Vanda, I don’t recall the last names. [indecipherable] I don’t — I don’t recall — is living in Tel Aviv, and this other one, also Vanda, lives in — in Jerusalem. She is not passing a very good moment in her life because she is — no — she is 70, she is overweight, she’s depressed, blah, blah [indecipherable]. Maybe I have to go there and cheer her up, I said, just making a joke, big joke, okay. So, and say, but you know who is living there is this person, Kornblum(ph) his last name [indecipherable] he is very much involved in keeping the — the — the people who were in this orphanage together, you know, and following who is living where, having the phone number to get in touch, and he also pub — publish a boo — a little book, memories of the young — a young boy’s memories, of his period of time on — during the war. And he is a very nice person, you can approach him, and he will be November 8, 2008 an excellent guide for you when you go there. An-And me — so I never had been in Israel before, and that was something which I own on myself. Actually, we were s — we were planning to go with my wife, in — in the year 2000, but she passed away in 1999 in April. So I didn't go, and after that I didn’t felt like to go, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: So, a— acouple years later, I called this person to — to Tel Aviv, and so okay, should I speak to you — you in English, or in Polish, what 1 — how do you feel more comfortable? So, either way. So we start to speak Polish, and I say, well, I am — I — I introduce myself. Say, oh, Sophie’s brother. This touch my heart. Somebody — excuse me — who remember my — my late sister so well. That was in January the 12", and then February the 12", I were in Tel Aviv. I met him, his wife. They were classmates, Sophie’s classma — classmates, so they knew each other —
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: — very well. My feeling seems — the congress in — in Toronto was very lucrative [indecipherable] I should call it like that. But a-also was emotional because I — I met people who I knew these people exist maybe — may exist, but I didn’t know how they are, where they are, right? And then — but brought me back to the family. And when I met blum — Kornblum(ph), and his wife, we agreed to meet in the morning for breakfast together in the hotel where I were standing. I didn’t know November 8, 2008 him and he didn’t know me, but I imagine that must be the person, and he was. Very pleasant. His wife was a little darling. And we stopped to talk at nine o’clock on the morning, was 12, lunchtime already, we were sti — still talking. So, you know, memories, things, what we do since, and what happened to my sister, you know. We — when she — he knew that she was living to — to Britain, to London, and av — nothing else, so — anyway, for me was to find, like us finding old family who I left many, many — lost many, many years ago. And 1966, in Buenos Aires, on the — on the platform, you know, waiting for a subway — was a station where combined two different lines.

   A: Oh, sour, terribly sour. I don’t know how I could eat it, but that 1s the only thing I got, so I ate it. And those things were bringing dysentery problems, terrible, too, and I survived them all. And I recall being very smalls there, that sometime the kids need to feel like to move the bowel, and they have nothing in it, so they — they — the intestine was going out. And the ladies help us, pushing it back. And we being so small, like four years, or four years and a half, we learned. So was not so many women to look after us. November 8, 2008

  </p>
  <p id="118">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="119">
   A: — into the other. So those things, I didn’t felt like 1t’s something terrible. When we talking in the normal circumstances, it’s terrible.

   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: So the sense of fear, that was unfamiliar to me, was very familiar to my daw — sister, and to my mom. That’s why, you know, when my mother took the decision to remarry, to the person [indecipherable] say well, she was one of the many Jews who didn’t want to be Jew.
  </p>

  <p id="139">
   A: In order to — you know, to feel like this.

   A: You know? And during the time I were living in England, with other Polish families which mainly were anti-Semitic, with or with no reason, I wouldn’t major —I-—IJI would be able to — how anti-Semitic [indecipherable] they will be just discriminating, or they will be hating the Jews.

  <p id="144">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="145">

  </p>
  <p id="163">
   A: No, I didn't — I didn't find no one from the first place where I were at. I find people from Otwock, was the — on the second place.

   A: Of course I didn't know any better.
  </p>
  <p id="172">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="173">
   A: The only thing was missing to me was the warmness of the caring person who loves me. I was — I was like a little animal. No, really, I mean it, you know. I — if I da — da — somebody told me something which I don’t like, I—I—I spit on him, or kick him, or — or you know, no manners at all. The biggest offense we can inflict one to the other is, are you a dirty Jew? We are all Jews. And things like that, so you know, it’s — I was too small really, to — to be conscientious and — 1n the hour of November 8, 2008 the situation I was living. Maybe the fact of being unconscious about it, saved me, protect me.
  </p>
  <p id="174">
