EL: Especially for me well we went in the, into the ghetto at, at a period in my life where I was already an artist who has had many exhibitions. And my day, day to day work was painting or drawing. Of course the arrival of the Germans and all those terrible, terrible things that happened around me made me stop everything. The Germans marched into Kovno on the 21st June 1941.
