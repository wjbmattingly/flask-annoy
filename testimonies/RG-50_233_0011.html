I took care of my two brothers and we get better. It is a sickness what you get from dirt. We had three kinds of lice because there was no hot water, we cannot take a bath. It was always the air raid because or the Americans came or the Russians came or the English people came and it was a rebuttal, it was a fight and unfortunately a German tank was standing in front of the house with German soldiers and they were firing like crazy for the airplanes. It was impossible to go out on the street, mainly for a Jewish. But the water was on the other side of the street. There was water. And then my brother dressed in my coat and in my hat because he said if somebody has to be alive then I am the one that has to be alive because I have to take care of my younger brother. And he went to the other side and he brought the water in a big pail.

But we were very afraid of him because the leader said that so many guns he had that he can kill all of us because we was hiding then in the coal, in the cellar. And then we did not let him in.

  </p>
  <p id="361">
   Q: Did you leave the building?
  </p>
  <p id="362">
   A: We did not leave the building because we did not know where to go. But my brother dressed again in my clothing because for a boy it was not so good to go. He dressed like a girl and he stumbled on dead bodies and stones. There were many dead horses on the street and people were eating the horse meat on the street. And my brother went to the ghetto to visit my grandmother and my aunt and they were alive. They were very thin, they looked like two girls, they were so thin. But they were alive. But they couldn’t take us home because the house was bombardiered, the part of it of the apartment, and it was winter. It was very cold, so we had to stay in the orphanage longer time for a few other months. Then my two brothers went to the orphanage home and just me, I went home with my grandmother.

  <p id="369">
   A: Yes, yes, they was wild.
  </p>
  <p id="370">
   Q: And then it’s only at the end of the war that you find out what had happened to your parents?
  </p>
  <p id="371">
   A: We was waiting there years and years and we went to all the organizations; we did not know what happened with them for many years and we were always waiting. When I saw a lady sitting on the bench then I -- maybe this is my mother, maybe she forgets where she lives or something. But then I get a letter -- my mother gets a postcard from a hospital in Budapest and the lady was together with my mother. She saw her. And then a neighbor in my grandmother’s house, she saw her dying.
  </p>
  <p id="372">
   Q: And your grandmother, this is...?
  </p>
  <p id="373">
   A: Vilma Mahrer, and this lady, Mrs. Pollack, she was dying and when she was dying she said she was together -- she did not want to tell us. But then when she was dying she told us what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="374">
   Q: This is which..?
  </p>
  <p id="375">
   A: My mother,
  </p>
  <p id="376">
   Q: Your mother, this woman told you what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="377">
   A: Yes, my grandmother’s neighbor was with her.
  </p>
  <p id="378">
   Q: In Ravensbruck? A; Yeah, Ravensbruck.
  </p>
  <p id="379">
   Q: What about your family of your future husband? Do you remember anything about what your husband’s experience was like at the end of the war? You mentioned that he was sent to different camps.
  </p>
  <p id="380">
   A: Yeah, different camps, yes. He was 28 kilo and was very sick, tuberculosis, diarrhea, etc. etc. They put him in the hospital.
  </p>
  <p id="381">
   Q: And then he was sent to Sweden. Was he sent to Sweden from Hungary or from Germany?
  </p>
  <p id="382">
   A: No, the English army liberated him in Bergen-Belsen. Their job was to carry the dead bodies to a big, big grave. That’s what they were supposed to do, by the wrist, you know. And then he was so weak he couldn’t do it anymore and he lay down among the dead bodies. Then when the English army came in, the soldiers take his pulse and he said in English because he knew a few words in English, 23 don’t leave me here I am alive, he says in English for the soldier, don’t leave me here, take me in the barracks because I am alive, 6631 1s my number and my brother’s number is 6630. Take a look where he is, find my brother and bring him tome. And accidentally my son was born in 1966 April the thirtieth, the same number what this Gyussi had and therefore he is named Gyussi.
  </p>
  <p id="383">
   Q: Now your husband, he went to Sweden, was he sent to Sweden by the British or was it the Swedish Red Cross?
  </p>
  <p id="384">
   A: The king himself was very much moved when they saw the pictures. They gave a ship and I think the Red Cross, I don’t know, they took them to Sweden.
  </p>
  <p id="385">
   Q: So your future husband went from Bergen-Belsen to Sweden?
  </p>
  <p id="386">
   A: Maybe first he was in the hospital but yes, he was very sick.
  </p>
  <p id="387">
   Q: So he went to Sweden and then he came back to Hungary after...?
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   A: He was there two years.
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   Q: And then they reopened their store and then sometime later you met him there.
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   A: Yes, I was vacationing over there. I met him. He had nobody and I had nobody and we got married.
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   Q: And then the family grew.
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   Q: When you think about all of these events in the Holocaust, what comes to mind above all else?
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   A: I think it was a big injustice what happened because we were really ordinary innocent people who did not hurt anybody. We did not take nothing from anybody and we did not hurt anybody and really it was a big injustice.
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   Q: What do you say to those who claim that it never happened?
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   A: We have to read them all the stories what people are telling them and if they listen to the stories they will believe it. One person can lie, two persons can lie, but so many people cannot lie.
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   Q: Do you have any other reflections?
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   A: Yes, I say that not everybody is a bad person and you have to look in everybody, the nice and the good, and in myself, in my person, I don’t hate anybody. 24
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   Q: How did people survive? What was the difference between surviving and not surviving?
  </p>
  <p id="400">
   A: In my case, in Budapest, the only thing that I was lucky because I could die or from the bombardiering or from the hiding, every day I was in danger, and I get sick of it. I get thyroid problem and I’m on psychiatric care.
  </p>
  <p id="401">
   Q: Your sense of this time, did you and family members, was there a determination to survive? A; Everybody wanted to survive, yes. That’s what it is -- determination. It doesn’t matter how and why and where but we have to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="402">
   Q: And what were you thinking of the future? Was there any discussion about the future whether this would come to an end? Was there any feeling that perhaps the Nazis would lose?
  </p>
  <p id="403">
   A: There was a feeling that they would lose, yes..
  </p>
  <p id="404">
   Q: From the beginning?
  </p>
  <p id="405">
   A: From the beginning, yes. We had a feeling that they would lose.
  </p>
  <p id="406">
   Q: Did your parents, for example, did they think that this was a temporary disaster?
  </p>
  <p id="407">
   A: Yes, that what they were thinking. Maybe they were wrong but they were thinking that we just...
  </p>
  <p id="408">
   Q: A storm, a passing storm?
  </p>
  <p id="409">
   A: Yes, and it will pass. Q; When did you realize, again you were a young girl, that the war was almost over and that the suffering might soon come to an end?
  </p>
  <p id="410">
   A: Pll tell you something, when my mother was still at home in November, we put our ears on the pillow, and we heard the guns and the fighting. It was not too far from Budapest, already, the Russians were very close. They were really close, we could hear them. Unfortunately they were not close enough and it took time then to come.
  </p>
  <p id="411">
   Q: The irony is that your parents who did survive so long were taken away just before the final liberation.
  </p>
  <p id="412">
   A: Yes, almost to the end. 25
  </p>
  <p id="413">
