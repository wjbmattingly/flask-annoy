   Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Joachim Baer, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on March 1“, 2010, in Leisure World, in Wheaton, Maryland — or Silver Spring?
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Answer: Silver Spring.
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: Silver Spring, Maryland. Thank you Mr. Baer for —
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   A: Baer.
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: Baer, for coming to speak with us today. And as I said in our introduction that was not on tape, what we’d like to do 1s start at the very beginning. Where were you born; did you have siblings; what was your family circumstances — what were your family circumstances; who were your mother and father?
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   A: Fine.
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: So maybe we could start there.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A: My — my name 1s Joachim Baer. I was born in Hamburg in December 20, 1929. I have a sister who is about four years older than I am. My father was a physician, he was a Zionist, and he didn’t look Jewish. And he had good pair — relation with patient. Interesting enough, my — the patient always talked to the — to the — the doctors, and they told my father that Hitler is building tanks and preparing March 1, 2010 for war. And he make a statement and everyone thought that he is crazy, that he say that Hitler is going to gas the Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: Who, this man?
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   A: No, my father make that sta —
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: Your father — your father made the statement.
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   A: — ke — statement that that’s what he’s going to do. And most people thought my father is crazy.
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A: And that was the atmosphere that time. And interesting enough, my w — my wi — my mother was afraid to go to Palestine, that was like a desert land. And in 1933 they took a ship and went to Palestine to see if you can live there. And then he saw that’s not so terrible, and that’s when he start making preparation. But the t-turning point was that one day, I believe in 1935, Hitler decided Jewish phi-physician cannot have any more non-Jewish patient. And my father was a doctor like [indecipherable] where he lost a lot of his business. So that was a turning point, and he say, it’s time to go.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: Can I 1-1nterrupt just for a second?
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: Because I’d like to even step back a little further. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: You were born in 1929.
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: And with a sister who was four years older.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: About, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: Okay. And your father was a physician.
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: Did your mother work outside the home, or was she at home?
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: No, no, she was a homemaker.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: Do you count yourself as a well-to-do family because your father was a physician, or was that not as such a prestigious post as it 1s in the United States, for example?
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   A: Well, doctors in Germany, they didn’t wa — didn’t make that kind of money like they do in the United States. But we had a very nice apartment, and he had a office near the harbor, because his specialty was venereal disease.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Ah, venereal diseases.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: And — yeah, and so he had to have all those sailor, which had syphilis. In those days there was no penicillin to cure them. So they suffer and 1t was a booming business, so to speak. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: I can imagine, because there was that section in Hamburg, isn’t there, where there’s — what is it called now?
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Yeah, there — yeah, the — the Reeperbahn.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: Reeperbahn, yeah, exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Yes, yes, yes, yeah. So — so we were well-to-do, but I mean, the — it — the —
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Did you have servants at home?
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: Yes, we had a dienstmadchen, you know, for the kids.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: A nanny.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: A nanny, and we had, I think, another help, we had about s-seven, eight rooms, I don’t know. It was a — 1t was well-to-do, nice neighborhood. But we didn’t go — the thing is, he was — I don’t know what time, when he got to Hamburg to settle down, but 1t was not too many years.
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: Oh, so he wasn’t from Hamburg?
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: No, no, no. He was born in Posen, which is in east Germany, so to speak.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: Correct.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: And then after World War I, Posen turned to be Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: So the family went and settled down in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: I see. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: And the reason we got to Hamburg, because my father needed to have a harbor where the sailor comes. My father was high intellect person, and he knew all the language, Norwegian [indecipherable] so he could talk to all the sailors.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: Sailors.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: I wonder what he — if there was no penicillin, what kind of treatment he did give them.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Was a very unpleasant treatment. It wa — was a —
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Tough.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: — was a— was a tough, yeah, it was a tough one, right. So, the thing is, one — how we got to — my mother wanted to go first maybe to Europe. And she and my father say no, if we go, we get out of Europe.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Oh, wo-would your — I’m still back in Berlin.
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Oh, oh, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Yeah, I really want to start at the beginning, before the politics.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: Okay, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: So, was your mother from Posen as well?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: No, she was from Marineburg(ph) with Auspoyzen(ph), you know, was the same. And — March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: So, Auspoyzen(ph) near K6nigsburg?
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: No, she was Marineburg(ph), was a —
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Marineburg(ph) is —
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: — was a small town. No, not sm —
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Would that be Marienbad today?
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: So it’s in Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, I think? A Marienbad —
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: No, no, there’s a different Marienbad, no, no —
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: — I think she — it’s part of — part of Poland, you know, I think so.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: Oh, okay. She was from there.
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Yeah. And my father came from a Zionist background family. My mother not. My father was — came from a religious, not — not super Orthodox, but conservative Orthodox family. And my mother had very little Yiddishkeit, so to speak. So he was a — he was a philosopher too. I mean, he knew Shea, he knew Spinoza and he knew th-the Bible, and he was a high intellected person. He gave speeches, he was the president of a synagogue and [indecipherable]. So he was a —
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: What are your first memories of your parents? March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Well, they were very nice parents, I mean, they were very lovely to me and as — my sister. And he was high intellect, so he used to take me for a walk and show me the — the — the st — the stars, and this is the big [indecipherable] there’s the smaller [indecipherable]. And he gave lectures, and you know, so 1t was — and I had problem with my Bible, he always explained to me. So he was high intelligence.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: And do you have memories of Hamburg itself, of the apartment that you lived in?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Yeah, well, interesting, I remember — see — see, the harbor was a main port. And one day my father had a patient, a captain on the ship. So he mem — he took me, I think with my mother, for dinner, whatever it is, on this — on th-the captain table. An orange was a big sensation those days, an orange. So — so as I wi — wouldn’t be caught in a— in acustom, I put the orange in my little ba — in my little coat. So this way we went though the custom.
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: So, in other words, in order to be guests of the captain on the ship, you ha — you were leaving the territory of Germany, and had to go through customs?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: Well, any time when you go in and out the harbor, you have to go through a checkpoint, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: You have to do this all over the world, you know. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: How old we — how old were you at the time?
  </p>
  <p id="79">
   A: Five years.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Oh, so it’s the sort of thing a five year old would remember.
  </p>
  <p id="81">
   A: Yeah. The thing is, I — only the [indecipherable] thing I remember, there was a Greek boy in our building and I used to play with him. And one day he didn’t want to play with him. So I came to my mother, oh, crying, he doesn’t want to play with him. But the reason he wouldn’t play me, because he knew I am Jewish, and Jewish was taboo. But my sister, who was 10 years old, she knew what was going on, and she really was so relieved getting out of Germany, because she knew what’s going on.
  </p>
  <p id="82">
   Q: That — those few years made a huge difference.
  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: Yes. Also, my — my sister was very — she got my intelligent of my father. She knew what exactly. Also, she went to a Jewish school.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: The Madchen school.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: And you were — were you already going to school when you left?
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: No, this — I was too young.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: Yeah. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: Unfortunate, because I would have gotten some money from Germany, as 1- interrupting of — of my studying.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: Of education, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="91">
   A: Yeah. And I didn’t get it. So I really was — I didn't suffer from the Holocaust, we — only this instant from the boy. But my sister, she knew what was going. Hamburg was a liberal city. I know I have a friend of mind who was from Konigsburg, and that sh — the parents sent him to Hamburg, because Hamburg was more liberal. And he went to Talmud Tora Schule, which was the school for the boys. And my sister went to the Madchen Schule. And —
  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: Mm-hm, the school for the girls.
  </p>
  <p id="93">
   A: — yeah [indecipherable] we were invited by the German — city hall you can call it, a-and my sister came from Israel and I came from here, and we visited Madchen Schule and there were paperwork for my sister, me s — playing on the shoka(ph) there, and —
  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Oh — oh, you mean a photograph of you playing on —
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: No, they ha — ha — a memory book with painting and all that.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: Oh, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: It was very interesting, yeah. So that’s — it g — it — it brought it back to me. So — March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: So Hamburg itself, so you remember in your mind’s eye the harbor. You remember your apartment.
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: We-Well, no, the harb — and the fi — funny thing 1s, there was a Jewish, famous Jewish ware — not — what do you call it? It’s a big store.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: Bertheimer(ph)? Bertheim(ph)?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: Well, I mean like — like a Macy’s here, you know, and it was called Tietz.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: And I-I — they had act — also a store in — in Berlin, which I didn’t know. So when I came to Germany, I don’t know, you know, after war, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: And I ask people, young people, where’s Tietz? They didn’t know. Then I asked an older people that she knew, and she knew that there was a — that’s a Jewish store, and they change it to Alster, or whatever you want to change it.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: Well, I remember in Berlin, there is a store that the hu — the biggest store, department store in Berlin —
  </p>
  <p id="107">
   A: Ye-Yeah.

  </p>
  <p id="121">
   A: Well, naturally they were Gentiles, you know, and I don’t know, we had full time — I — I don’t remember exactly. But the only thing which I remember 1s this Greek boy, he didn’t want to play with me. And I didn’t understand what the others were talking about. But I — I remember my — my mother tried to sell some of her furniture, because they had what they call a lift. A lift was like a container —
  </p>
  <p id="122">
   Q: Yeah. March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="123">
   A: — to take to Palestine. So, I remember selling the merchandise, and put it in a container. The interesting was, my father had to leave before January 1936 to Palestine, because it was a law, th-the British [indecipherable] any doctor who came before the first can practice their medicine without going for a test.
  </p>
  <p id="124">
   Q: Without having to be reexamined.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: Yes, that I remember, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: Tell me about that, what was it like? Was it huge, was it — March 1, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: Well, those days there were no huge ship. One thing which I remember to this day is we went to Yugoslavia — forgot the name. And that time there was war of Italian and Abyssinia.
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: And there was not enough coal for the ship, so the ship had to make a stop in Yugoslavia to get coal. So we got off the ship, and for the first time I saw Muslim, with — you know, the fu-funny looking, funny — I didn’t like it at all. So I was crying, the ship going to leave, the ship going to leave. I want back to the ship. My mother was saying no, no, don’t worry about it. Oh no, I have to go back to the ship. I felt very uncomfortable. And then we come back and so Mom, you see, the ship is still waiting for us.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: I remember that. I remember staying in Trieste for one night on the — in the hotel til we got the ship.

  <p id="376">
   A: Well, some people went to Israel, they didn’t want to hear German, they were very —
  </p>
  <p id="377">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="378">
   A: — mad about German, they didn’t want recuperation and all that. See, my father liked the German culture. He knew Spinoza, he knew Schiller, he knew all that culture of German. So he say well, this 1s Nazi, but it’s German culture, so you cannot mix them up, you know. So —
  </p>
  <p id="379">
   Q: He sounds like a very wise man.
  </p>
  <p id="380">
   A: Oh yes, he was, he was, he was. And my mother didn’t need any other language because every one her friends spoke Germany, the grocery spoke Germany, and also when she went to the bus, they knew all German, or Yiddish, you know, so she — there was no — but she tried to learn Hebrew. She went to school to Hebrew, but —

  </p>
  <p id="383">
   Q: And — but when you went back, being in this German speaking environment, did it — did it affect you in any way”?
  </p>
  <p id="384">
   A: Well, on — I remember that on the bus there was a young teenager, the daughter of one [indecipherable] and the explanation was in German, and she told them, in our house they forbid to speak German and you — oh, here everything is in German, everything in German. So then, the next day, they brought the German student who spoke English and German, and he did the explanation in English.
  </p>
  <p id="385">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="386">
   A: Yeah. So it was a resentment. The — one of the people that, at the end of the thing, there was a party with the mayor. And the — our spokesman say — he said that his father, like my father, had the hakenkreuz. And two of my brothers —
  </p>
  <p id="387">
   Q: A hakenkreuz is an iron cross, right —
  </p>
  <p id="388">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="389">
   Q: — from World War I.
  </p>
  <p id="390">
   A: Yeah, right. In fact, two of my brother, they gave their life in World War I. And he [indecipherable] and say, we fought, Germans, our country and all that, and March 1, 2010 look what you guys did to us, you know, and he gave it to them. And naturally the — this was younger generation, you know. My father made one statement which is interesting. They say, why don’t you go back to Germany? He say, how can I go back as a — as a physician, and th — my patient can be one of the [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="391">
   Q: The — the — fe — one of the criminals.
  </p>
  <p id="392">
   A: Yeah. How can I treat as a doctor? I cannot do it, you know. But he was a Zionist anyway, had even — he didn’t think about it, but some doctors from Haifa went back to Hamburg.
  </p>
  <p id="393">
   Q: After the war.
  </p>
  <p id="394">
   A: After the war. And they practi — what I think I couldn’t understand 1s, when we were to the [indecipherable] of the Black Forest, that’s where I met my parents, and there was people from Israel, who went to ho — went to —
  </p>
  <p id="395">
   Q: Excuse me. [tape break] Sorry. Uh-huh?
  </p>
  <p id="396">
   A: There was people who went from the concentration camp. The German government paid for their holung, for their treatment. But I couldn’t understand, how can you go through hell, and come to Germany, and get treatment here? I couldn’t not under — understand it. And then also we met one Gentile from Hamburg. And he said, oh, this building 1s caput, this one 1s caput. And I was March 1, 2010 thinking myself, good, that he went caput, but he, oh, caput, caput, caput, caput. So
  </p>
  <p id="397">
   Q: It’s a— yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   A: It’s a— now today you have only new generation, you know, so — but interesting, the guy in the — in the bus, which I mention, his — his grandfather was a Nazi. And he was very, very interesting about the Holocaust and what they did. And he really — that’s why he had this job to translate, because he really wanted to have [indecipherable] Holocaust survivor, because he was inside, very, very disturb about it.
  </p>
  <p id="399">

  </p>
  <p id="404">
   A: Well, even I didn’t go for the Holocaust, and even I didn't really knew too much about it, cause I didn’t — it still in the back on — of you. You know, you went through all that hell, so to speak. Even was not hell, but it’s there.

  </p>
  <p id="406">
   A: Yes, it’s — someone asked me, what is the most in — who was — who — who — who affected your life the most? And my answer is Hitler. Hitler got me — 1n fact, when I came back to Germany, to Hamburg, and I wanted a money from them for the interruption of my education, I told them if I would live today in Germany, I would have been probably a doctor like my father.

  </p>
  <p id="408">
   A: And you say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah [indecipherable]. But I told him that. And interesting, I says, the Nazi, they didn’t like to hear the word Nazi. They said sociale — they — the Nazi didn’t — Nazi —
