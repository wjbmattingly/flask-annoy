   Q: No one really knew.
  </p>
  <p id="343">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="344">
   Q: When you got to the other side of the plank, what happened then? On the Russian side?

She said bring it with you. But I was young and little so 1t was a hill that you have to climb up. SO I was holding onto this painting and painting. Then my brother he was, one habit he had. He counted how many people he had and he saw one was missing. I was the one was missing. He came back and threw the painting in the water and he grabbed me and there was only a certain time that you could do it. And then the Russians put us in jail for 24 hours.
  </p>
  <p id="350">

  <p id="355">
   A: Because they know that they were there. They were on the border you know. This was their mission.
  </p>
  <p id="356">

  </p>
  <p id="377">
   Q: Did what kind of job?

   Q: Are there any thoughts that you’d like to share with others who do not know much about the experience of the Jews who ran east and then ended up being caught in the Soviet Union and forcibly deported. Or what would you like them to know about your experience.

   A: Well my experience is that you know no place is safe. Nobody knows what’s tomorrow and we have to make the best of every day and of course the hope Israel will be strong and safe and the same for the United States cause I love the United States and you know to raise their children in a, in amore Jewish way and to know what war can do to them.
