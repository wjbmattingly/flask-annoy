  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: I want to clarify. You just said something I couldn't tell. You said you didn't think they were going to let you in, but you thought that they would eventually let you in?
  </p>
  <p id="131">

   Q: Did y'all talk about that and make a decision as a group?
  </p>
  <p id="209">

  </p>
  <p id="329">
   A: Yes. You know what? When we came back to Hamburg, we--everybody--every girl has to wash clothes for three guys, you know, because the men didn't know how to wash clothes. So everybody had to--every girl had three boys to wash for them clothes. And we did that, you know. We were very close, one with each other, but not, you know--we were always together.

  </p>
  <p id="332">
   Q: And looking at the Exodus experience, sort of as a whole, how did you feel when you were experiencing that as a concentration camp survivor?
  </p>
  <p id="333">
