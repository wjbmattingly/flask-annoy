  </p>
  <p id="128">
   Q: Not really, but maybe you can translate it.
  </p>
  <p id="129">
   A: Iremember Reichsbund Judesche Fronsoldaten [ph — German]. That means Organization of the Jews who were fighting during World War II, World War I and they had a newspaper. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 And they also advertised if they needed somebody, some help or somebody, some certain places. So my father said the best thing is you have to get out of the house. You cannot stay in the house because you’ve got to get up, go out. And doing. And I may have, I'll tell you the whole story. There was a ad looking for a young fellow who is willing to get in the clothing trade so my father said that might be the thing for you. So I volunteered. Volunteered, they volunteered me. (laughs)
  </p>
  <p id="130">
   Q: You may volunteer.
  </p>
  <p id="131">
   A: I was a volunteer and it lasted quite (sound interference) I would say quite a bit, might be a distance from where I used to live. I would say about 150, 200 miles away. So I was there for one night, for one night and I said to myself I don’t like it here and I’m not interested in this and I’m not going to stay here. So I, I sent a telegram to my father and I wrote send me money. Or I’m going to do something. Well they telegraphed me money and I didn’t say anything to the owner of that place where I was supposed to work but he knew something was not kosher and he was watching every move I made. So he seen me going to the post office, picking up that, the money and I didn’t even take my clothes and I run to the station. And the first train was coming just as I got to the station, the first train came in. But I see that the owner of that store, he was behind me and so I don’t know if he seen me or not but he was watching more if I step in the train or not. But there was a, I seen there a big garbage disposal there and I jumped in, not to be seen. And wait til the train moved away and after he was gone, I got out of there, tried to clean myself up a little bit. Anyhow, it worked and I got into the next train and then from there to Mannheim. I mentioned Mannheim. There was my brother at that time. He found a trade. And so I figured that was on the way home. Was staying there for a day or two and then I went back home. And my father asked me, what would you have done, if you wouldn’t have us send the money? Because I said at that time, send me money or I’m going to do something. So I said nothing. And that was the end of that.
  </p>
  <p id="132">
   Q: So now you’re back home with your family and what did you do then?
  </p>
  <p id="133">
   A: I don’t recall. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="134">
   Q: We’re talking about what year? What year are you talking about when you went away?
  </p>
  <p id="135">
   A: Talking about years. I’m getting confused.
  </p>
  <p id="136">
   Q: That’s ok. And then the next big change happened when or how?
  </p>
  <p id="137">
   A: The next big change was the, I was accepted in Cologne. Cologne there was a Ha Shara [ph], you know what I mean. I was Ha Shara and from all parts of Germany, youngsters, they came over there. But Cologne was not the only one. There were more but I happened to land there in Cologne and I was there. We were, they met. To give us an idea about how things going to be in Palestine. And we were all sure that they’re going to send us to Palestine. And they told us so too but I was one of the last ones, the newest ones who come to this place. So the way I was, so we let, give me one moment please. Yes, oh yeah. Then came an order from the Nazis that every Jewish place where everything Jews, they are gathering together, the youngsters. They want so and so many of them they should work for them. So since I was really one of the latest who came in that place, to that place. They didn’t want me to go. They wanted to get the elderly, the most —
  </p>
  <p id="138">
   Q: The older?
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   A: The older ones, yeah. And so we were, they were not too thrilled about it so I said, I volunteered and I landed up in a village not far from Berlin. And we, that was in the winter and the snow was pretty high there and we are cutting trees. It was a bad experience for me because I always had wet feet and if I could not act with the equipment, shoes. The food was not too bad. We got from the farmers. The farmers, they fed us. And we were sleeping at the haystacks.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   Q: What was the name of the village?
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   A: Lukenweisser I think. Lukenweisser yeah. And I was there for a while, was about a couple of months. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   Q: You were working for the Germans, right?
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: Yes, for the Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   Q: For the Germans
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   A: Yes, yes and after that I said that’s enough for me. I have to do some — I said to myself I’ve got to get out of this. So I went to this Jewish Agency to Berlin and managed and I told them I can’t take that no more. So they sent somebody else instead me and I went back to Cologne. Now, from now on, I was there another -- how long, another few months and then there was a trip organized going to Palestine now. I usually the newcomers, to there had to wait. They were not eligible but in my case they made a difference because I did work for the Nazis over here. They says we’ll get you on there. Now the ones who organized those, a trip was only one trip. And that was the last one. The man who organized that, that was rich Jews and in return they took them also. They were allowed to go because the idea was to get the youngsters out ok. So in that case they added them also to — Then we went to Vienna.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   Q: Ok are we talking about 1939?
  </p>
  <p id="147">

   Q: That’s ok. When you were working for the Germans, what was the treatment? I mean were there any anti-Semitic incidents then?
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: No, no because we didn’t see much Germans. They only were walking around and see if you are working or not, but other than that no, no. There was no problem. So like I said —
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: Did you have any communication with your parents when you were —
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: Not at that time. I lost communications. Yeah but later on I picked it up again. Afterwards when I knew I was going to go to Palestine I went home and that was the so called goodbye to my parents. That was the last I’ve seen them.
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: Your brother and your sister, when you were leaving, where were they?
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: My sister she left to the states in 19, oh she left much earlier. About the year before or two years before the war. I would say two years before the war. She was lucky to get out and at that time it wasn’t really that bad in Germany. So she got out. My brother he was working as an iron worker near Berlin and he couldn’t make it so. And my parents they will report to, oh I forgot something yeah which is very important. When yes, at the 38, there was the 38 the Crystal Night.

   Q: That’s ok. So now you’re in Vienna and you stayed there for how long?
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: For just about a week and then they drove us to the Danube, the river. And we were, there were three ships and they brought us to Sulina, that’s in Romania, that’s beyond the Black Sea. From the Danube we went in there. And we from there, we seen the little freighter standing and they transported us to the freighter. The freighter is supposed to go to Palestine. Now when we came to that freighter, they had some bunks there but not enough to take care of everybody there. So we were there for several weeks because they were waiting for the crew to get our ship out. And finally they came, after several weeks and then they brought us to Palestine.
  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: What did Palestine mean to you at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="197">
   A: It didn’t, what it meant was to just to get out. Palestine actually, I was not a Zionist. I didn’t know anything about that. You thought that it would appear that they were talking about Zionists so anyhow we came to Haifa.
  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: Did you feel very German before that? Did you consider yourself German?
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: Yes, yes I did. And everybody did. Practically.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: Even your parents felt that they were German. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: They felt they were Germans because they were treated nice and everybody treated them nice until really shortly before the Crystal night. Then everything changed. And we knew that there’s no future for us. And we came to Haifa so it took us a long time. I would say a couple of weeks til we got there. To the —
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: What was the name of the boat, do you know?
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: Atific [ph]. Yeah it was a little boat. It was altogether close to a thousand tons that’s all. So and we landed shortly before we came to — we landed in Haifa but not at the pier that is in the British. So I forgot something here, yeah. We ran out of coal. We ran out of water. We ran out of everything because we were several weeks on the sea. And so I volunteered to go to the machine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little better food there whatever. And then when we came to Haifa and there was a big ocean liner standing there. It was supposed to bring us to whole lot. And one of the British islands there, Cyprus yeah. To Cyprus. And so little by little they transferred us to that ocean liner. It was called Patcific, Patria. Was called Patria. And then all of a sudden nobody really wanted to go but we didn’t have no choice. So then the Hagenah did some things. They brought some explosives with the food that they loaded. And they told everybody who was on that boat, not everybody was transferred yet. Maybe were transferred I would say about 500 people and altogether we were 900. So what happened was yeah, they told us we should go on deck in the morning. Go to the, on deck there is a meeting so I said I’m going to sleep a little longer. And then all of a sudden I heard a boom and I thought it was a bomb. That is over here something not 100 percent kosher so I was running up to the deck. And on my way up I felt already I had to hold on, on the railings because the ship was leaning to the side. And then I came up to, soon I came up on top there. I lost my balance and I slipped to the other side of the — and which was a little bit under water already. So I had no choice. I didn’t know how to swim but I jumped in the water. I had no choice. And some fellow seen me. He was in the water too and he seen me that I’m struggling. So he went behind me and he pushed me, kept on pushing me to the little boat they have which came to — they didn’t come close to the ocean liner because they figured if something is going to https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 happen, something going to explode better to stay away from there. So everybody who got out of there had to swim a little bit. Yeah. So got there on that boat and that was in fact ok with me and we kept to a big, a big hole there. How you call it. I forget. And we got clothes there and we got food there. That’s the Jewish Agency, they took care of everything. And the British, they watched us like a hawk.
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: This is in Cyprus. You’re in Cyprus?
  </p>
  <p id="205">
   A: That was, no that was in Haifa.
  </p>
  <p id="206">
   Q: You’re still in Haifa?
  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: We are still in Haifa. Because not everybody was yet transferred to the Patria. The ones who were not transferred to the Patria yet, they think that they are the ones who sent them later to Cyprus. So what happened to us? We went to Atlit, that’s a big camp there. And we were there. And then one morning everybody, they got everybody out to Atlit, even the ones who are supposed to go to Cyprus. But then the British came one morning and they got them out, the rest of them. They had their names. They got them out and they rejected so they had they were using sticks and some of the guys there, the people there, they threw their clothes away so then they got, they considered that. They were standing there without clothes, without anything. But they took them out anyhow. And I was in Atlit for about four months. I would say I didn’t have such a bad time there because the food was excellent. I was a volunteer. This time in the kitchen. And they had those big cat, cassels that they put the food where they made the food, I don’t know exactly but there were altogether in the camp close to a thousand people, maybe more. And that was in the — everything was strictly kosher there.
  </p>
  <p id="208">
   Q: Did you know Hebrew by then?
  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: No, I knew how to read but it didn’t mean anything to me. I didn’t know the meaning of it. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: You just knew German. That’s all you knew at the time.
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   A: Pardon.
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: You just knew German, that’s all —
  </p>
  <p id="213">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and I would say I was there for about six months. And after that I went to a kibbutz. They didn’t ask me. They came. They let us go and there was a group already in the kibbutz, Ashdod Yakov. And I was there several months. And I remember it was very hot and so they give us lessons in Hebrew in the afternoon. In the morning, everybody has a little job, something to do. Yeah. But I didn’t pay much attention to the afternoon lessons because was so hot outside. I couldn’t keep more. So that was one thing and then I’m — every kibbutz had to send some people into the army at that time because there was a, they called it the Palestinian army. So naturally they didn’t want me to go. They wanted to go people from the kibbutz who are there for a long time. But they told them if you go to the army, you go to the box. The box that means that’s the part who stays in Palestine, doesn’t go out of the country. And that’s because at that time, the war was going on and didn’t . And they were afraid that Germans getting closer and closer so it’s very important to be in the country, to defend ourselves. But so I didn’t like the kibbutz. I didn’t like the life there. I didn’t like the way -- they treated us ok but I didn’t like to take orders. But anyhow, usually you take anyhow when you get into the army. So I volunteered to the army and —
  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: You’re 18 by now? How old are you? Are you 18 by now?

  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Yeah so I went to the army and they asked me over there as someone to go overseas. So ok. They took me and they prepared me in Salafet. That’s the, Salafet that’s the place where they got https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 the, all the people together which going to be fighting. They prepared us in Salafet, that’s the name of a town.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="219">

  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: But you had no contact with your parents?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: No, I didn’t have any. I knew through my sister that they transferred them to Lagosh [ph] and the trains and that they were there for several months and then they sent them to Auschwitz. So now where was I?
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Now you’re getting training you said cause you told them —
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Yeah I got training yeah. I learned how to drive a truck. That’s what. So that was another week so and then they sent us to E] Aleman and I felt ok. Everything was nice and quiet. There was no big action going on at that time until one night and they started. Nobody knew what’s going on. We heard artillery and the planes and then we went, we marched forward. And then we came to Benghazi. Benghazi and then to Tripoli. I don’t want to get in all the details. And that was it. I was there when the invasion to Italy started. So we went to get, they put us on landing crafts, big landing crafts with the trucks in there. So we drove in those landing crafts and when we came to Italy that was below Salerno. And we drove out and we had a nice reception there. Luckily I got away without any serious injuries. But then you didn’t see the Germans any more. They disappeared so I was in Italy. I was there for another couple of years.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: Oh a couple of years.
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: A couple of years Let me think, yeah. I joined the British Army in 1942. I remember that. And the war was over in 46. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: 45.
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: 45, 45. But I still was in the army til 1946. Yeah. So-
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: Did you go back to Palestine or you stayed in Italy, when the war was over?
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: When the war was over, it wasn’t over for me yet because you know the war is over, you don’t pack your bag and you go home. So they kept us and then I was yeah, when the war was over I was close to Italy there. Not to Italy. I mean to Austria or whatever. I was very close. And I took a motorcycle and I went to Germany with it. (Other person: You went AWOL)
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   A: AWOL.
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   Q: Oh you did, away without leave. A-W-O-L.
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   A: Oh that’s what it is. Away without leave. Yeah. So was they knew of course the motorcycle was missing after a while and I was missing so it was the reason. The reason why I want, wanted to go to Germany. I wanted to go to Germany because a friend of mine, he told me that — did I mention that my brother, that was in Auschwitz too.
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   Q: No you did not.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   A: No, I didn’t no. He was a good mechanic and they kept them pretty — he, I didn’t know much but my friend, he told me, he wrote me that he’s seen a list of this . So I was — and he seen the name Herzog there but that’s all. So I asked, but that’s all. Nothing. He says that’s all he knows. He’s a survivor. So I said to myself, I’m going to take a chance. You know I had no rights. So anyhow, how do I get there, to Germany. You know from Italy. You know, well I think that’s the best bet. I took the -- a bicycle and I took off. And I went to Illingen. I figured https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 maybe I’d see him there. But he wasn’t there. So I asked some people and they told me that he went to Munich. I don’t know what he did in Munich but he’s going to come back and so I was waiting there two or three days and then I decided I have to go back. Yeah. Otherwise I’m going to get in bigger trouble. So on the way back, I stopped near Frankfurt. I stopped there and I says look you have come all the way down here. It took you two days and you get there. Now I’m not going to leave until I know really what’s going on with my brother. So I turned around and I went back to Illingen. And we’re not talking about from one corner to the other. That’s about 150 kilometers or something like this. So and the people there are very friendly. They always want to be with us, so I have no problem to stay with anybody there overnight. Sure enough, a day later my brother shows up. Yes, I was so lucky. I said, look maybe we can arrange, that at that time, the Jewish Altrits [ph] you know the arranged to illegally deport some survives. They brought them to Palestine. Somehow, I don’t know but I had the same chance. To bring my brother over. He says no he’s going to go to the states. I says all right. So I went back to my unit and the camp commander happened to be a Jew too. And so I got a court martial and I forgot already what it was but it was not easy but it was only on paper. And that was the end of it so I was there for another few months. Then I went back. I was discharged, kept to, I had suit, a British suit and some money. Not too much. I think was like a hundred dollars something like this tops. And they let us go. And I said that to myself. I’m not going to go to the kibbutz any more. I go to Tel Aviv. So I went to Tel Aviv first in, I also had some money for a hotel for a week or so and was looking for a job.
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   Q: This is 1946 we’re talking about.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   A: At the end of 46 yeah. And I was with a friend. And he had a sister in Tel Aviv so we went there and we had dinner with them. So in exchange we washed the dishes. Yeah and finally I found a job. It was very hard but I am (both talking). So I found a job in a restaurant washing dishes together with my friend. So but that didn’t last very long because they went bankrupt for one reason or another. And after that I was working for the British. They had on the north side of Tel Aviv, they had a camp with trucks. And those trucks they went out every morning to pick up the Middle East mail which was distributed by Jewish, not only Jewish but Arabs too. And I https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 slept in that camp because I ran out of money and I had a little tent there where I slept. So and I picked up every morning, picked up from Tel Aviv and from Jaffa some people and brought them to the camp. They got their truck and everybody took off in different directions. And that’s what I did. And so I was working there for about three months. And then I, one of the guys which I picked up, he says why don’t you come one evening? We make a little party on Friday night. We have the dancing and I says ok. And that’s where I met my wife. And that’s the end of story.

   Q: This was with your wife?
  </p>
  <p id="300">
   A: No. No, my wife she came with me and she was several weeks there and says it’s not for her so I figured out let’s try something out. It’s no big deal. I was a partner in a discotheque and you come and you visit me every so and so few weeks and I come over there —

   Q: What city in Germany were you in?
  </p>
  <p id="302">
   A: Cotsuway [ph]. So I was there for four years altogether. We seen each other quite often. And that was it and then I gave it up after that time. And went back. So then I went into car wash business. Together with my brother.
  </p>
  <p id="303">
   Q: I was asking what your thoughts are about Germans and Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="304">
   A: I tell you something. When I went to Germany, at that time, it’s hard to believe but that’s already a new generation over there. And they were very friendly, specially when they heard somebody comes from Israel. And they all used to wear the Mogen David. (connection dropped) https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014
  </p>
  <p id="305">

   Q: PI talk a little louder. I was asking what your thoughts about Germany was and you said you were treated very well when you lived there and it’s a new generation.
  </p>
  <p id="310">
   A: Yes, because the like I said, the war was over a long time ago and I remember they have certain laws when it comes to Jews. I remember at that time in Berlin who was the Chancellor in Berlin was, Gerhard something like this. Anybody who says even dirty Jew they put them in jail. Because they felt very guilty of what happened. And so that’s a big part. So they tried to do the best they could. Personally since I’m very familiar with the language, I didn’t have any problem. And there are some, some survivors from the concentration camps, some of them that said I never could go back to Germany. Well that’s understandable. But it’s like a completely different story now. It’s not the way it was. That you cannot forget yes, but that’s what it is.

  </p>
  <p id="319">
   Q: Wonderful. As you said you feel very American. How often do you think about what you went through in the 1930s with Hitler and getting your school closed? Do you think about that at all?
  </p>
  <p id="320">

  <p id="326">
   A: No, how could I be. I could be angry of somebody I know who did something but take a look for instance the place back home, from Illingen. They all liked to, they loved us you know. https://collections.ushmm.org March 6, 2014 Before and then the time come when I came back to see my brother. The most of them still were there. And they all were very happy to see me. Yeah so you can be angry of somebody you know who did something. But you cannot hate the whole world. I cannot do that.
