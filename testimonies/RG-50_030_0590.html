  <p id="216">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: And I have a very nice picture of their house, and it — on the first floor they had a saloon. On the second they had their apartment, and they had three rooms like m-m — hotel, you know. So that was their business. And on one picture it is shown advertisement that doctor, dentist Finkelena(ph), because they came later a little, came, and their — her address. She — you know —

  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: Market square, yeah. So, how large was Serei? Was it a town, was it a village?
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: They write like a village very often. It was, you know, I am now a little surprised, because I have two monuments. One monument was done very soon after the end of the war, and all the years what we were knowing from Moscow to Vilnius, and then to Serei to this place, once a year definitely, in the summer, there was a monument. I have this monument and it was written that in this place was killed — were killed 100,900 people; men, women and children. They say by Nazis and the other collaborators.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: Local collaborators.
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: Yeah, local. And then they changed this monument. I didn’t see the new one because we already couldn’t go. And another lady, two ladies went from Vilnius, they are now in Israel, and they sent me the picture. But I never could read what is written. And somewhere I found, because I have materials of Chana(ph) Slovatitsky(ph). She went — she came to America about — she was maybe 11 years old, because she had here a Uncle [indecipherable], Dr. [indecipherable]. And he had to help her, she was — she had such a —

  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: Yeah, she couldn’t straighten out, and he helped her. And finally, I tried to see her. And I was in Chicago, because she lived in Chicago, but I saw in Chicago another Serei woman, a woman from Serei, and she was out of town, and I don’t know why, maybe because she left very young, I was dreaming to see her, because she was my friend, despite the differences —
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: Age.
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: Yes, I was older. But she didn’t try, so I didn’t see her. But she went to Serei later, and I have everything about her visit.
  </p>
  <p id="234">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="235">
   A: And there is a lot of new things, and there I saw what 1s written now.
  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: What is written now?
  </p>
  <p id="237">
   A: Now 1s written, first of all, not thousand, not 900, but 953, if I remember right.

   A: I can’t understand, and I even don’t know who to ask why. Before we were going very often.
  </p>
  <p id="244">
   Q: I can see whether we can find out for you, as far as th-the — the research that’s been done for that part, for Serei and the surrounding regions. Usually by now there has been some sort of investigation to find out more detail.

   A: I mean, there’s 900 — 953, if I remember right, approximately, but at least two times less.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Yes. But my question is, how large was the community before the war, the Jewish community in Serei? Was it a thousand people, was it several hundred?
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: Well, they were writing that it was 1900.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: No, no, no, I’m not talking about those who were murdered, I’m talking about the town before World War II, or the village before World War II, about how large was it? Was it a big village, was it a small village? Were October 15, 2010 there hundreds of people, were there thousands of people who lived in it? Do you remember?

   A: Return Vilnius. And this was so for me also. I wanted so much to get Vilnius that the day when it was by [indecipherable], I was in a very high spirit. But when I came to the gymnasium, I saw that we were six girls, Jewish girls, that they are sitting — I saw something is going on. And it turned out that some of the Lithuanian girls, especially one was there, were saying that you are — you don’t have your own — no, you — you don’t have your own country, and you are |-like cosmopolitan, you know, and you — you are not happy like we are happy. Despite what to say about myself, for me it was a very nice day, but when I came and I saw it, everything turned out different. And it ended that this woman put — she went on the table, and she said again that you are — you are — you don’t have your own, you are not patriotic, you are not happy, and you have to be killed. You and you and you and you, and she showed all six. That was the first day — yeah, I tell you this because it was.

  <p id="480">
   Q: Ideas.
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: — ideas. But, we cannot. So, we understood that they are not ready, and they were — they didn’t participate in this all, and many girls didn’t participate, because there was among them a lot of friends. And a — a small part — but when — when our teacher Magnitskas(ph) found out about it, he was very, very angry, and he talked about. He explained what — that it’s un — impossible to say such things.
  </p>
  <p id="482">

  <p id="493">
   A: Oh, absolutely.
  </p>
  <p id="494">

At least before the beginning of the — that was in the summer, and it was not the beginning of the course, first course. But there was a group, and I was participating in the group that was for Russians that didn’t finish the 10 years —

  <p id="854">
   Q: Yeah, lita. So tell me, at that point — well, not at that point, I want to go back, and I want to ask a question that may sound very, very naive, but it’s coming from what I’m trying to gather from your story. The war will happen. Your parents are frightened for you because you belong to the Komsomol and you could be shot in the first days, clearly. But did they fear something for themselves? Did they fear that there would be some — do you think that they were afraid that something would happen to them? They certainly may not have liked the Nazis, but did they think there was some danger for them?
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   A: I am sure they thinked it was danger. She knew what was going on another, it was not the first — they knew what is going on in Poland, they knew what is going on in the other places, but at the same time, unfortunately, I was not in touch, I couldn’t find out anything. But I dot — didn’t believe, so maybe they had hope. But very soon, you know, when they were already put to death, September ’41, 10 and 11. The 10" were the men, and the 11", women and children. September. So it was only 22™ June, July, August, September, four months.

  <p id="856">
   Q: Four months.
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   A: Yeah, and they were all put in a school, but it 1s not a school, it is a school to become — to have a specialty. And in this school — October 15, 2010

  </p>
  <p id="872">
   Q: I wanted to ask, when you were in Saratov, and then you were in Nowosibirsk, clearly you must have been thinking of what’s going back on — back in — home in Serei.
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="874">
   Q: Were you trying to get in touch with your parents, with your family, or was there no way —

  </p>
  <p id="876">
   Q: No way.

   Q: Well, were you hearing already things about what was going on there, or not?

  </p>
  <p id="882">
   Q: Mm-hm. But this is — I’m still trying to get a sense of what you knew at the time. Not what one could find out later, but what, for example, did the October 15, 2010 radio say? What did the newspapers write? Did you ha — was there any news of what was going on then?
  </p>
  <p id="883">
   A: I—I was reading, but I — I am saying again I couldn’t believe, but it became a very difficult time for me, you know what? I was going, for example, the time when it 1s already close, to find out when it goes to the end. I was going — let’s say my — my aunt, I lived with my aunt.
  </p>
  <p id="884">
   Q: Mm-hm, in Nowosibirsk.

And then there was in — in Nowosibirsk, a — lithua — Lithuania had a person who was taking care of Lithuanian evacuees.
  </p>
  <p id="918">
   Q: Okay. October 15, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="919">
   A: But that was Nowosibirsk. I got in touch with him and he made me like his secretary, but only I was far away. And I had to talk to other people, and he gave me, not shoes, but you know, for winter —

   A: No, absolutely not.
  </p>
  <p id="934">
   Q: And I’m going back and repeating my question. You were saying you did not believe what was written in the newspapers, so that means something was written in the newspapers during the war about what was going on.

  <p id="949">
   A: I did believe in general, but my —I —I-—I-

  <p id="950">
   Q: Your mind couldn’t imagine that such a thing — okay.
  </p>
  <p id="951">
   A: My mind couldn’t imagine that this could be done. But what had happened with me, I all the time was — that was a bad thing. I was — let’s say I was coming from the sixth floor, my aunt lived on the sixth floor. No elevator. When I was g-going back, if I will meet somebody on the way, that’s okay, if I will not meet, that is bad. I am going to the tramvajai, you know what is tramvajai?

  </p>
  <p id="956">
   Q: I don’t understand. If you would meet the tram, if the tram would be coming, or if the person —
  </p>
  <p id="957">
   A: No, simple, simple this — that was my own — I was all the time thinking what will be when it end the war, I will find my parents, or not.
  </p>
  <p id="958">
   Q: Oh, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="959">

  </p>
  <p id="960">
   Q: I see.

  </p>
  <p id="962">
   Q: In other words, you played a mind game with yourself.
  </p>
  <p id="963">
   A: Yeah.

  <p id="973">
   A: — that bad. That can make you, you know —

  <p id="974">
   Q: Crazy, yeah. But of course, you didn’t know. You had no —
  </p>
  <p id="975">
   A: I didn’t know, no. And I came to Moscow, to my aunt, and she lived in one room in a — an apartment which had another room where there lived another lady, a researcher. And another lady lived with my aunt in one room, so I was the third one. And this lady, she was a nurse, but she was helping the one, which is the researcher, she was better off, and she could pay her. She was making for her — oh, she was like a helper, you know? But she’s — she’s — she spends the nights in our room. So it was a room, here 1s a aunt, here is this lady, and here I am. But relations were good, and in the same apartment, in the same, were an apartment for a family, a family of four or five. Father, mother, two children and a grandmother. And in the kitchen, everybody had his own place —

And there is the — there the name is — I have a—a photo, I am standing in this house where they lived, the time til they were brought to the amaty mokykla. That is simple a family who was giving us milk, they had always a cow, and they were bringing milk, and they let Father and Mother and Etta to live with them, but it was not a long time, very soon they were taken. So I have the house where they lived a tre — few months.
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   Q: Ah, so they were — so, in other words there was no ghetto really in — in Serei? People — the place was bombed, and your parents had no place to live, so they went here —

  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   A: No, oh, I — I — I know that very often, what Hanna(ph) Slovatitsky(ph) writes in her — that she cannot remember what she did this day.
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   A: I cannot say that I — I — I remember tt.
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   Q: What did they — what were some of the things that they told you about your parents during that time?
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   A: The wife of Salvoukas(ph) said she tried, because they couldn’t go out, and they couldn’t buy something, so she tried to — by some way, she was telling us, she was buying eggs and bringing them to this —
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   Q: Yes. October 15, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   A: — place, and trying to help with — but it was also dangerous, but she did. She told me this and she cried, because she couldn’t imagine — a lot of good people, you know, a lot of good people. And when I read now about the woman who says she will never forget how she saw my father in the beginning of the —
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   Q: Column.
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   A: — column, yes, 1n — with — with blood, and she could see that he was beaten. She says it. And I got this paper. Unfortunately, it’s in Russian written, but this piece I translated. So, I can give it to you.
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   Q: When you got it, did you — did someone recognize it and send you that article, knowing it was about your father, or did you open the paper one day and there you read it yourself?
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   A: No, no, my [indecipherable] my uncle’s daughter, she read it, because we didn’t pay a lot of attention to Russian papers, because we had to — we worked, and we had to read English, to know better English.
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   Q: You’re talking about now here, you’re in the United States, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   A: Yeah, in the United States. And she sent me this paper.
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   Q: And so this is th — she sent you this paper —
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   A: And she called my husband, and she read it to him, and he says, the first time he says, don’t tell it to Frida. But she was very surprised, that what I October 15, 2010 had to know. And she called me, and I found out, and I was very upset that Arkady told her let — let — let not tell Frida.
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   Q: Yeah. Well, he probably wanted to protect you.
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   A: Mm, he wanted to protect —
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   Q: To protect, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   A: — yeah, but it’s not the case. I have to know. I am watching everything, all Holocaust movies. I am always watching them, and I — because I have to —at least I have to feel a little. I have very often, as older I become, as more I have the feeling of guiltiness that I was not with them, and I didn’t have to go through this all. It’s very difficult to imagine my sister, my father, my mother, how they were — how it was all — and I was not there.
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   Q: But I am sure that for your father and for your mother and your sister, it was easier for them, knowing that you were not there, and that maybe you survived. That — that for them it would have been harder to see both of their children in that situation.
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   A: Yeah. It would be good to be a very believing, and believe that we will see someday.
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   Q: Are you a believer?
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   A: Huh?
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   Q: Are you a believer? October 15, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
   A: I don’t know, after what is going on all these years. After the Holocaust and it is still so bad everywhere, with the hating of Jews, I don’t know why, because I know where — I know bad people. For me the nice thing is ap —a person has to be good from bad. And now in Europe and everywhere. I don’t know why.
  </p>
  <p id="1094">
   Q: That I — at that point you mentioned — you mentioned your — Salvoukas’s(ph) wife, and that she was a good person and that she cared. But I want to bring up the other person you told me about earlier, who was the organist’s son, who you said participated. What did you find out about him?
  </p>
  <p id="1095">
   A: He — oh, I— I don’t know if he was — I — I will ask, maybe Mira(ph) knows. But at least he couldn’t come back and he had to — to pay for this. But how it came out, I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="1096">
   Q: So, but what did he do? What do you know that he — what were you told that he did?
  </p>
  <p id="1097">
   A: What he did, he helped to kill.
  </p>
  <p id="1098">
   Q: Uh-huh. Were there others in the town —
  </p>
  <p id="1099">
   A: They di — yeah, there were, who helped to kill. They came to Salvoukas(ph). They asked everybody, but Salvoukas(ph) refused. And he October 15, 2010 said, the only — but he was also afraid, you know, the only thing what I can give you is my — no, the pferd.
  </p>
  <p id="1100">
   Q: Oh, the horse.
  </p>
  <p id="1101">
   A: The horse, right, pferd, pferd is —
  </p>
  <p id="1102">
   Q: Pferd is the German word for horse, and so probably also the Yiddish word for horse.
  </p>
  <p id="1103">
   A: Yeah, a pferd. The horse.
  </p>
  <p id="1104">
   Q: And so, did you find out whether they were — in Serei, was it Germans who shot, or was it Lithuanians who shot? Do you know who it was, did anybody tell you? In Lithuan — in Serei.
  </p>
  <p id="1105">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1106">
   Q: — when everybody was shot, did anybody tell you who did the killing?
  </p>
  <p id="1107">
   A: Who did the killing, they — everywhere they write collaborators, Lithuanian. But I didn’t know who, exactly. What I remember is the son what I told you, and others I don’t know. I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="1108">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1109">
   A: What — you know, who live there, it was very difficult to come to this place, and nobody came back to live, nobody.
  </p>
  <p id="1110">
   Q: Of course, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="1111">
   A: And there the cemetery — October 15, 2010
  </p>
  <p id="1112">
   Q: How often were you there, to Serei? You said —

   Q: From that first time —

   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1116">
   Q: — from that first time it was once a year until you left?
  </p>
  <p id="1117">
   A: Every year until I left, then in ’88, we went to Moscow and from Moscow we went to Vilnius, and from Vilnius we went to Serei. And since then I haven’t been there, because — I wanted very much, very much, but unfortunately, my medical —
  </p>
  <p id="1118">
   Q: Situation?

  <p id="1147">
   A: No, I— because, you know, I — my feelings to Lithuania are not bad. Not bad, despite the — what happened. But at the same time, I know — I knew a lot of guys and girls who were so nice and so good. So, I understand that that is everywhere this way. And Mira(ph) was telling me about the ones who are still there. One is a very famous doctor, a very good guy, and one excellent guy was — he is also there.
