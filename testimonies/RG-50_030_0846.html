  <p id="32">
   Q: Okay, so you didn’t have a middle name?October 21, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: No, I didn’t have a middle name.
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: She has two names. You know, the reason that she has Aviva, because it was after my father come from visit from Palestine. It was not yet Israel then, you know, it was Palestine. British — British Palestine.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: And what does Aviva mean? What is the — the meaning of the name?
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   A: What’s — pardon me?
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: What is the viva — Aviva, what does it mean? What is the me —
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   A: Oh, fre — Aviva in Hebrew it means spring, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   Q: So it was very appropriate.
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   A: Appropriate, yes, and — and she wa — she wa — also, there was city named Tel Aviv, it’s still the same name, so altogether, makes sense.
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   Q: Yeah. What was the language that you spoke at home with your parents?
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: At home? At home we had actually two languages. The parents spoke between themselves in Russian, and sometimes in Polish, but with us they all spoke Polish.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: Always Polish, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: Polish, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: Did anybody speak Yiddish at home?
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Thanks God, no. I tell you why I say thanks God.October 21, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Tell me.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Because Yiddish — people that spoke Yiddish, they couldn’t survive. You don’t know why. You see, peop — nobody will tell you this —
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: Tell me.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: — but I can tell you. The reason is that Yiddish left very heavy accent, and very heavy kind of m-music type of thing, you know. And people that spoke Yiddish, they can’t get rid of it. So, you know, as soon as they opened mouth, you know, they — 1-1-in Polish, they knew that they are Jewish people, and it means that they couldn’t — they couldn’t save themselves pretending to be Poles. So many thousands of people died because they spoke Yiddish. It’s very unusual, but that’s is true, I bi — nobody tell you because they say that it is offensive. It’s not offensive, it’s just actually, this is how it is.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: Mm-hm. Did —
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: Yeah, go ahead.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: Does that mean that most people who spoke Yiddish didn’t speak Polish, or they spoke it with an accent?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: No, 90 percent, I would say, spoke Polish. Some, maybe in the small sh — s-s — shtetls, you — like you know, the children, maybe they just spoke Yiddish only, butOctober 21, 2015 most people spoke both Polish and Yiddish. The ones that just spoke Yiddish, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. So, were your parents more assimilated, in — in that they spoke Polish and Russian, or —
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: Absolutely not.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: They been — we [indecipherable]. It’s better — my father, he preferred to have a kosher food.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: But you know, from this you cannot — you change the type of food, and nobody knows who you are, you know. But the language you cou — you couldn’t get rid of it.
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   A: It’s just — it’s — yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   Q: It’s an accent, or it’s a —
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   A: It’s accent is kind of like a melody type of thing, Yiddish is. So that’s — many people died because of this, but see, I am the first one that’s not afraid to tell about.
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your father and your mother —
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: Okay. October 21, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: — starting with their names —
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: — including your mother’s maiden name. So let’s start with your father —
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   Q: — what was his first name?
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Father is D-Dawid —
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: David?
  </p>
  <p id="75">
   A: — and it was his original name, and — Dawid Dynin, yes. My grandpa, here’s a picture hanging up here, he’s Mo-Moses. And, as a matter of fact, I was — he was bro — 1s my wife had visited his grave in Vienna, because he was co — po — he was in Vienna. He died in a hospital in Vienna.
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   Q: How did that happen, that he died in a hospital in Vienna, and not in Poland?
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   A: Because in Poland at that time, they didn’t have this kind of medical help like in Vienna. Vienna was a center of — of medicine in Europe at that time, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   Q: Okay. Tell me now, I’m a little bit unfamiliar, was L6dz, or L6dzZ, was that part of the Austro-Hungarian empire before independen —
  </p>
  <p id="79">

  </p>
  <p id="80">
   Q: Okay.October 21, 2015

  </p>
  <p id="83">
   A: I would say so, yes, generally.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: I know there was also a lot of Russian influence too, you know. So it must be something to do with — with Russian, but I think it was absolutely that there be many Germans living in Lédz.
  </p>
  <p id="86">
   Q: Okay. Even before the wars?
  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Yeah, yeah.

  <p id="2492">
   A: No, you know, because listen, everything is miracles, you know. Everything is so unbelievable, because — because I am very not everyday person, honestly. Let me tell you something, look, when the — when the Russian — Russian offense started from in — from direction of course of Minsk, and all of this, direction toward Horodyszcze, and farther, you know. But then we knew this according how’s it 204October 21, 2015 going, according movement of this German military, because we have seen pushing by through the main highway. We have been next to the highways that going to Baranovichi, you know, so we knew the transport was going somewhere. We look it up and then we see lot of German cars going from di — in direction to Baranovichi to — to this way, and down.

So I figure out uh-oh, this mean already is closer, you know. And they — they declare — same time they declare evacuation of Horodyszcze. This was fantastic because evacuation is mess, nobody knows anything, nobody cared to arrest somebody, you know, the evacuation, it — it absolutely fantastic in our case, you know. But how to move, and where? So they decide we — we — they dec — dec — they decide ts — look, our — our ho — this place that we’re living had not far from police department, you know. I will show you on the map how it is. And they — they said — I ask one of policemen, where are you going? We going to Warsaw, he said. But this is not — this is just — it was — was not true. Later, I figure out that’s not true because I knew geography, and I know the 205 October 21, 2015 way how we going that it’s not Warsaw, but Kénigsberg. So you know, but they — they lie that they going to Warsaw, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="2497">

  <p id="2498">
   A: Just to fool around. So — so — so we figure out Warsaw, fantastic, here, let’s go — let’s jump — jump on one of the cars what everyone’s — was empty car, nobody staying next to the car. We come to this cart, and with horse and everything. And they decided to — to leave, and they left and we had been living together with them, you know, nobody check —

   A: So, you know, we went with them. And then, on the way, you know — on the way they decided that this cart, they liked to have [indecipherable] cart, so they — they gave us another cart, you know. That’s fine, so we got another cart. So we have anything left, because this means that they used to us, you know, that we — we are okay, you know what I mean? We — they figure out they can question what we’re doing here, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="2509">
   Q: Right.

But we didn’t — I didn’t check what’s underneath, I figure I just — you know. And so we went in one place, you know. Here again, we have to do with priest, how about this? We went to one place that we decided we should run away from them because they are going to Konigsberg, and not Warsaw, we better get out from here — this place.
  </p>
  <p id="2513">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2514">
   A: So I went to this church, and the guy, this priest was ver — was very ir — understanding, and he said yes, by all means, don’t stay with them. So, I mean, but 207 October 21, 2015 where we going? So he got — he — he told me exactly where to go and where I should s — make a left turn, you know, th — I have it here, this what he told me.

  <p id="2521">
   Q: Well, you have the guns.
  </p>
  <p id="2522">

  </p>
  <p id="2523">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2524">
   A: —I didn’t know. But then, you know, so after sometimes, you know, the guy on the left side start to be tired or something, and he disappeared from this, I don’t know what happened. And the other guy, just before we — we cut — we come to the ci — to the town that we should go, he still was there, but he has close eyes, and he was sleeping with the horse, you know. But — but — but you know — but we went a 208 October 21, 2015 little farther, and I figure out he sleep very well, and le — we can come back, you know, we can turn back and turn this place that he [indecipherable]. And then was — then th — the problem was, it was German camp next to this, and I figure out they will see that somebody’s running from this thing, they can run after us, you know. But this horse, just like we understand something, he start to run like crazy, you know, and I didn’t say anything. And we just went up so fast, you know, that they f —I figure out even if they will see that we’re something, will — it will be too late for them to catch up with us, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="2525">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="2526">

  <p id="2530">
   A: But how do I know about the guns? Because — because we left this cart, you know, after the — they — they took this horse, they too — they left the cart, and we went to these woods, you know. They were big woods, you know. So we figure out 209 October 21, 2015 this is safer to be in the woods with other people. And he told us that Ukrainian partisans had been there, and they found guns, ammunition. But they left uniforms. So we took the uniform. Later, we sold them.

And they been shooting in direction to Russian. And each time they shoot, it was so noisy, you know, was just terrible. But the problem was not what they shoot, but they shoot against them, because we have been there. So this — after some times, we didn’t wait too long, they started to shoot in the — in our direction to hit this —

But one of them hit very close to us, I remember very much, and we had been shocked, you know. But this was — after — after this, we had enough of this area. We had come to the woods — inside the woods, you know, because in big part of the woods, you know, and they — not only us, there had been other people that run away from the villages too, because there have been bombs and [indecipherable].

   Q: Well, tell me. Tell me, how did it happen?
  </p>
  <p id="2864">
   A: Okay. Now it was something that — I think it was something to do with Haganah, it was something to do with this, because I don’t know why I — one day I was in place named Sarona, it’s next to Tel Aviv, but at that time it was next to Tel Aviv, it was not part of Tel Aviv. Now it’s — it’s like a suburb, you know. And what was so wrong on this was a -— this was a village, a — that was built by not — by Germans, before, you know — probably in the — in 19" century, or something like this, you know. They had been there probably from religious point of view, I would 238October 21, 2015 say probably. But when the war started, and there was fight between Nazis and no Nazis, the Germans run away from this place, evacuate it, and left everything — this village as it is, you know, didn’t take anything from the — from the houses either. And I was there, you know. I was very curious to see how — the houses, nobody’s there. So I must see what’s inside there. So, you know, so I pick one house, it look kind of nice to me, and I don’t know how I come inside it, if I opened the window, or s — or somehow I sneak inside. And I look it up, and what was — I was not interesting in clothing, you know, but I needed to see what — some kind of literature, what they do. And I found in one place they have been bunch of fives — five books or six, to — to write — writing schoolbooks [indecipherable]. And on one was a — was a picture of Nazis walking with swastikas. So, do you know what I did? I took it. And I have here to show you.

  <p id="2868">
   A: And then figure out that this is something like this, I cannot stay — I cannot wait too long with my book, I should write about. So, you know, you know. But I — I tell you, I — I — so I— this was one of the things that pushed me to write, you know, 239October 21, 2015 because I figure I — after these things and these son of a bitches, you know, I — even — even on this area here, sh — they have [indecipherable]
