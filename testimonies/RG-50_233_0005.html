  </p>
  <p id="152">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   A: When he passed away we used to call him the Jewish grandfather. He was saved by a Jewish guy. How he was saved, he broke up that time with Stalin and Lenin. They were all together when they started out the Revolution. He was a Socialist when they broke up. He start running away. When he came into a village and that particular village was a blacksmith and he run into the blacksmith and put him down the arm against the wall with Jewish religious things on him and the Cossacks chasing were chasing him, they came in, they looked for him and they couldn’t find him. They saw him and when they came out back so the officer said to him did you see him. He said no, there’s an old man, an old Jew with his pals and his tzitses (spelling). And he survived.
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   Q: Now he became a Jewish grandfather? 8
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   A: That’s it. And he was there. As soon as he passed away --
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   Q: What happened?
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   A: Anti-Semitism. They used to have boycotts. It’s a privilege to boycott
  </p>
  <p id="158">
   Q: So even in Bialystok you had boycotts?
  </p>
  <p id="159">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   Q: How about your father’s meat stores?
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: Oh yeah. Meat is another story to talk about. We used to kill kosher meat . They passed a law that they wanted to take away from people Jewish kosher killed. The whole world protested at that time, 1937, 38. So finally they permitted to kill kosher so much and so much. I will never forget as long as I live, we used to sell a lot of restaurants in Bialystok. So one morning I came in like 5:00, 6:00 in the morning . The main meal is lunchtime, so they stopped cooking about 7:00, 8:00 in the morning, so I had to be in the store 5:00, 6 o’clock in the morning. We had one store wasn’t too far from the railroad station so at 5 o’clock when the shift changes in the railroad workers so they banged on the door. Mr. Bass, Mr. Bass, grandfather died. That’s how we heard the news that the grandfather passed away.
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   Q: Grandfather Pilsudski? Besides the boycott and the limit on kosher killing of animals for meat, were there other changes after he died?
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   A: Well, I wouldn’t say I exactly remember. Like I said before, you’re young and you don’t realize those Naturally there were a lot of changes . (The tape is difficult to hear). The Germans had a lot of influence at that time. In our hometown lived a lot of Germans. They remained from the First World War. They were manufacturing textiles. Bialystok is the second largest city in Europe in textiles.
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   Q: You described the German population of Bialystok. When it came to anti- Semitism who was the greatest danger to you, the Germans of Bialystok or the Poles?
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   A: The Germans maybe they did it more in intelligence, but the Poles did it like pogroms or fighting or things like that.
  </p>
  <p id="166">
   Q: So there were pogroms in Bialystok? 9
  </p>
  <p id="167">
   A: Not in Bialystok direct because Bialystok was 85 to 90 percent Jewish city. So they didn’t start it up. Bur there were some other cities
  </p>
  <p id="168">
   Q: Who controlled Bialystok? With the large Jewish population, who controlled the city government?
  </p>
  <p id="169">
   A: Polacks. Jewish hardly were elected. Doctors, lawyers, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="170">
   Q: When the Russians came in was your father able to keep his stores?
  </p>
  <p id="171">

  </p>
  <p id="175">
   A: Three stores.
  </p>
  <p id="176">
   Q: Three stores -- bourgeois. And they sent him where?
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   A: My father was liberated, he was innocent. When he came in, the same day he came in when my father was arrested, we came into the police station and started asking for my father. So they told us to see one of the big jails there. We used to cut our bread in half and send the other half to my father. After the liberation in 45-46, my father and I got together, my father and I lived together. We slept in one bed and we cried our tears out. He told me he has never seen Brisk (?), he never even knew how it looked. They put him in . They sent him six weeks -- sixty days and sixty nights.
  </p>
  <p id="178">
   Q: Siberia?
  </p>
  <p id="179">
   A: Six weeks, they took him that long. He always used to kid me. If you would be there we used to cut trees, he used to tell me a dozen people could dance a waltz on it such huge trees.
  </p>
  <p id="180">
   Q: Did your family get any word from him during that time?
  </p>
  <p id="181">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="182">
   Q: No one knew what happened to him, no letters, nothing?
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: Nothing. We didn’t expect that. But right when the war ended, he used to write letters. In Bialystok, we used to have a guy used to take care of our accounts. He was an accountant, so my father used to send a letter to him and we used to send 10 letters from Germany because we were liberated from Germany. Somehow my sister was liberated not far from Poland and we spoke to each other said we going to be liberated we’ll all come back to Bialystok. But who knew the circumstances with Germany and Russia with borders and all that, but she made it into Poland. Came to my home town there were maybe ten, twelve people, they all left they couldn’t stay there . That’s how we got together with my father we brought him into Bialystok then to Germany and then to the United States.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: You were in Bialystok in September 1939, when the war broke out? What were you doing?

  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: Did the Germans come?
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: The Germans came two years later, 1941. Because Poland, if you look at a map, you see Poland has a river the Bug.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: And the Russians took the East and the Germans took the West. So for a year and a half almost two years, you are under the Russians. So what did you and the family do?

  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: They sent you to school?
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: Their school. They allowed us. After 4 o’clock they sent us to Russian school. I just tried to explain the reason why, they prepared us for the army. A year later or two years later they would probably take us into the service.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: How did your family make ends meet? Your father was gone, the meat stores were gone?
  </p>
  <p id="193">

   A: Cooperative. They called them . And they made a kitchen there. The textiles run three shifts every day, day and night. We had to prepare twenty-four meals a day for three shifts. One time, they always used to have a lot of dancing, the Russians. In that same factory they built up a place with a platform, they used to go every night dancing. I was a youngster, I was dressed nicely and the director was a Russian guy. He used to come over all the time and ask “where did you get it?” I said, what do you mean where did we get it? We bought it. I was young, I didn’t know what to answer. I didn’t know their system in Russian. He said, you mean you have money, you go to the store you bought shoes, you bought a suit.
