   Someone interviewed me once, and asked uh a very simple question: Uh, when you left the ghetto um, hmmm, uh did you say goodbye to your mother? (Long silence) Uh, you know, this is problem that a teenager will have, or a youngster, uh, no doubt a parent would put a child into a relative safety situation, but would not do it for himself or herself. Uh, you know, my mother could not, or my father leave, and say, uh, whatever will happen to the children will happen, but the other way around they did it. You know, one of the reasons that my father didn't leave the camp uh later on where he was because he felt uh, we needed a place where there was some sort of headquarters, maybe that wasn't the entire reason, so you know, parents had bigger responsibilities, whereas, as a youngster, you did what your parents told you, and somehow you assumed that parents in their omnipotence are going to make it, whereas parents didn't have that illusion. And what were the parents' chances versus the kids? Well, it had great deal to do I believe with who the parents were, adults, uh, if you talk in terms of chances, surviving, where? Uh, are we talking on false papers, or are we talking in hiding? Are we talking in a camp? Uh, at all phases, uh, there were accidental factors and there were factors that had to do with the personality. Certainly, if you were a man, you had less chances to survive out on false papers because you would be so readily identified as a Jew by the fact that you were circumcised, whereas you couldn't absolutely prove it uh to a to a woman. And that uh again, that had to do also, at what point. You see, time is a tremendous factor here. It was so different in 19 uh late in 1942, than it was in 43 and when you get to 44 becomes impossible. We have to reload. That's a good point. Beep. Let's finish talking about that. How different were conditions in during different years over the course of the war? The chances for survival depended upon at what point in time, uh, a Jew found himself, and, and various situation, be it on false papers, be it in hiding, uh, be it in, in a camp. First of all, uh, personal resources were exhausted. For example, in, in our case, my mother and sister and I, even though separate, we were on false papers. Our resources were exhausted in terms of money even, having some, uh, in terms of having people that we could rely upon. Now, you have some contacts. Those get exhausted. So that the longer it lasted, the less chances that that one have for survival. The same thing was true in camp. Uh, you know, a, a, if a camp was liberated a week sooner, many more people would have survived. Uh, if the war ended six months earlier, a great many more would have survived. Remember that the Germans were so dedicated to the uh Final Solution of the Jewish question, that to the last minute, they were diligently working on this project. So there, the more time, it was really fighting for time. Every day, every hour, mattered. Can you give me a general picture of how you survived from when you left the monastery until the
