   A:. .in in...when I was in Budapest. This was still the Budapest under Communist regime. It was very difficult to have conversations. You were, of course, followed everywhere and you were under supervision everywhere and you had to be very careful what you talked about, and more was a delightful (laugher) subject which nobody could uh uh object to. And so I told one evening this story and and uh the dinner where I was invited and the major Jewish uh personalities of the various groups, they they...all through those communities, the liberal community, Zionist...they were all there and uh the result was that a few months uh weeks later, I got from the office of the World Jewish Congress in Budapest a letter, saying you told us this interesting... BREAK IN TAPE ...and report what they lived through. And we have here about four thousand such uh witnesses and there are some which write and speak about uh the and the . Are you interested in these .. reports? Now I personally, of course, I was interested but uh the uh those who really needed it was uh the the international authority pursuing the the , soÂ«I looked for an opportunity to get in touch with the people who were involved in the in the uh prosecution of the people and I wrote a letter and there was no uh personal communication since Germany was still completely cut out from the circulation, normal circulation, and uh and I learned that Kastner was asked to uh to go as a witness to Nuremburg and they asked him to take a letter to uh to Nuremburg and give it to the uh uh competent prosecutor. And he did this, and when he came back he told me the story which was very uh stranger He didn't...this was typical of Kastner. He didn't just give the letter (laughter) to to the prosecutor who was Mr. , the assistant...the former assistant of of uh . He, by the way, has written a full book about the uh the prosecution about against and the and so on, and when he came to...when Kastner came to , whom he didn't of course know, he was there in order to give witness in the case against Baker (ph) and the people with whom he had cooperated, and when he gave the the letter, the prosecutor looked at the signaturea found my signature, and said something like, hum, very reliable. Very reliable. Now he was, of course, fascinated and flabbergasted... how does this man know my name with all, and (coughing) and asked him. Then he told him, you know, this 18 a long story. I can't tell you this now but if you have time in the evening, we can go have dinner together and I'll tell you the story. And so it .. happened, and it happened that he told him the whole story which you'll find them in Morganthal's diaries which were published in Collier's a few months later. I heard this story the first time from Kastner. Was a little bit uh doubtful, but when I came uh uh a month or two months later to the United States, this issue of Collier's appeared, while I was there, and for the first time the whole story came out and uh I must say I was very impressed by by the . They are very fine uh uh civil servants and we owe them much that this sabotage will see uh State Department, they came out and and was acknowledged. There was a clear line in the State Department which really didn't want to be cooperative. I think the head of it was Breckenridge Long (ph), uh one of the higher officials in the State Department who was put there by Roosevelt because he or his family had given considerable funds to to the election...electoral funds of Roosevelt, but really the the policy which they pursued I don't think really were in the line of of Rooseveltts liberal attitudes. Uh Breckenridge Long really considered his holy duty to keep the Jews out of America. I think this can without reservation be affirmed.

  <p id="1">
   Q:Uh there are those historians who say that uh Peter Berksen and his organization... BREAK IN TAPE
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   A:This I have heard many times. I personally believe that this 18 highly exaggerated. Uh I believe one can argue very uh uh with with great justification that my telegram of April 1943 with all the proposals it contained, uh has led directly to the establishment of the of the uh uh refugee board. I think when when these proposals were submitted to Morganthal and , and were approved by both, and nothing happened, and found out in July which means several months later that nothing happened and went to Morganthal and complained, and that led to the decisive action of Morganthal. One...in the asking of the report asking the two assistants the boys they paid to find out what really happened, and number two, he he he...really on the basis of this reportt he was able to go to the President and to complain. Thirdly, he was able at the same time, not only to present this famous report on the acquiescence of this government in the mass murder of the Jews, he was able to use this opportunity to come with a positive suggestion, and this positive suggestion he had uh prepared it with his uh legal advisor, Professor , and this was the idea of the War Refugee Board. Now uh I believe he has a direct line. As a matter of fact, uh even the way in which the matters proceeded, uh when I got just before Christmas the first license, and I talked about this already, and then the revised form ten days later and then another revised form uh making business easier. Uh had made all kinds of criticism of the strictness of the uh . Again, about two weeks or three weeks later, and the second revised form is really the day when the War Refugee Board was established and the facility of these licenses extended to everybody. Now here 1s a very clear line to show that this was really the outcome of these plans which I had submitted and which Morganthal picked up and and used as the major uh material in order to ask the President finally to act. He was uh a great politician. He himself used some of the uh propaganda of Birksen (ph) to put it...to the disposal of his _1 own policy. But he used it. It was not that they had really the decisive influence. There are uh for a long time plans from this extremist groups uh that they had decisive influence on things as they developed. I contest this very much. I think that uh they may have had an influence on public opinion at certain moments to uh raise the consciousness of the the public, which I will not contest, but on the real action I don't think they had any decisive influence.
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   Q:Uh what were the most important actions of the War Refugee Board as you see it?
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   A:Well, let me say...I1 mean the War Refugee Board has also been criticized a number of times and said that certainly, rightlyt it was too late. It was much too late. It was...1t came into force in the beginning of uh 1944. If it would have been established a year earlier or two years earlier, it would have been probably much more efficient, but nevertheless, it was mainly the only decisive action which was taken, and the whole situation changed uh all over. We had really the support of the American embassies and legatlons all over. In in Stockholm and in Lisbon .. and in and in Bern, and in Ankara and so on. And this never happened before. Here is really, and this you have to acknowledge even if you're perhaps critical on some of the actions he could have done more, but it was a decisive effect. Number two...during the period during which it was active, that means generally '44 to ,' | 1 May '45...this early the end of the war, uh twenty million dollars have been uced, Jewish money...I come to this later...twenty million dollars have been used in order to alleviate the fate of the persecuted, the Nazi persecuted victims, Jews and lots of nonJews, uh but the great majority, of course, Jews, and the the money was Jewish money. Now with this money, lots of things have been done but it was not only the money. It was also the determination to explore all possibilities by which Jews uh people...victims could be helped and and the uh action of the Nazis counter-acted. Uh my opinion, there were a number of things which were finally uh were obtained. Uh on the one hand, for instance, there were a few uh...which has nothing to do directly with the War Refugee Board but it has to be mentioned as something which has has happened...uh the exchange uh uh agreements. There was a number of of uh prisoners of war who especially wounded and and heavily wounded who were exchanged as through the Red Cross, and there was a great number of Palestinian Jews amongst them. I Aaw the the train passing through Geneva. Uh these were important actions. The second is a certain...I'm not exaggerating...a aertain alleviation of the situation in the neutral aountries. Uh not direct guarantees were given, but they were encouraged and they were told .. well, we will help you after the war to distribute the people that not...shouldn't be only on on on your charge. This could have been much more energetically pursued, in my opinion (coughing) and it should have been. I believe that Switzerland could have taken in the double or the triple of of people which they they took in, and w they're they're not so many countries who can say they took as many as Switzerland did, but but...and this was the general situation. But this was important. Then the what I said referred indirectly of any..the end of the uh financial blockade and of the food blockade in favor of the victims. This is really a great decision, and I quoted how I was received in Bern when the first license came and they were very astonished because the British had blockade and so the ministry of uh..-I don't remember...economic warfare I think it was the name in Britain...uh tried to stop the license until the last moment, and in fact it was given to me several weeks after it was also was to be delivered. Now this was really important. Uh really there was no no uh lack of money any more. If you really wanted to do something, the money was available. Uh I wouldn't say that Sonny Meyer (ph) and others who disposed _ , they had some problems there. And we certainly had problems, uh couldn't raise the money in Europe at the time, (coughing) and the the food blockade. I mean I never...I think I said it already...I never observed a food blockade. I uh 1 disobeyed my colleagues and my superiors in America in this matter. They were not very happy, but ". I considered that I was in a neutral country and I could use uh and .\ should use whatever I could in helping starving Jews in the occupied territories and this would...but a great action. I think , it was engaged and food passes by the Joint through the International Red Cross. T think they gave them a million dollars or something like it, and this was done now under in a in a very...in a much larger uh uh proportion as it was possible before. : . ! 8 I myself...the the Congress...the World Congress office in Geneva has uh during the war sent hundreds of thousands of of parcels, uh mostly from Portugal, small parcels but uh which certainly have have helped thousands and thousands of people to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q:Let me stop you there for a second. They have to fix something in the room. They're shutting off the tape. Just a few seconds....
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q:Dr.Riegner, you were telling us about the actions that the War Refugee Board took or made possible.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   A:Yes. Uh I spoke about the uh the big . Now uh the next point I would like to underline is the support which was given to the actlvities of the underground uh in order to help Jews on the spot uh to survive through uh thanks to false papers which were used in great masses, uh papers of every kind uh especially uh ration cards which had to be renewed every month uh could use in the tens of thousands and the hundred thousands probably. Identity papers, false identity papers, uh baptismal certificates which were of course not , but uh showed that the people were not Jews, uh uh working permits, uh every kind of identity and uh identity cards and so on which could be used in very very larte masses...uh numbers and uh we had in France but particularly groups who were charged with this job. And it was not only this helped uh tens of thousands of people to maintain themselves, to hide and to somehow disappear under the general population. On the other hand, there was a special service established in western Europe by the Jewish uh resistance movement which tried particularly to organize the immigration of Jewish youngsters uh towards spain and Portugal and then the free world, or towards Switzerland. And uh these groups uh were extremely successful They brought several thousand children to Switzerland, a number of them with their parents. There were several hundred parents also came. Uh there were a considerable number of youngsters accompanied by armed uh uh conduct to the Spanish frontier and uh then they came out to the $ree world. Uh this is...was one of the most successful activities and covered, as I said, thousands of people. Uh of course, you would have liked to do much more. It was directed outside particular by my colleague Mark Yahblume (ph) who was one of the French leaders who wrote from nineteen hundred and fortythree and nineteen hundred to the end of the war...was nearly end of the war in Geneva in my office, and we did this together. Uh he got money from the World Jewish Congress, from the Jewish agency, from the Joint, from the trade union movement, and uh altogether this was by the way one of the finest compilation and and rescue of of all kinds thanks to a person uh which was accepted in and which was...who was active in thi6 and kept the uh contact with the groups in in the occupied territories. Uh this is one of the finest things I think uh which took place and I'm very proud to have been personally involved in this and have helped in this. Another very important action and this was the political . . 10 action to save uh whatever could be saved of the Hungarian Jews in 1945. Uh here again something happened which 1s very strange. We knew uh and I was responsible to warn before the Hungary was even occupied. You can see in the files telegrams which I sent and and...several weeks before the actual started of the occupation of Hungary, and immediately when it was undertaken, there's another great telegram where I asked uh what should be done in order to counteract it and it should be made public counteractions so the medias or the radio and so on, through t-he free radio from London and the and the...it should be very...an action encouraging not to cooperate with the Nazis, encouraging the non-Jews to help the Jews, to hide them and 80 on. There's a whole program which uh they have suggested to the free world and which was uh I believe to a certain degree used in uh by the the media and so on. But uh | uh the strange thing which happened in the case of the Hungarian Jews was that uh from March to June uh 1944, there came practically no direct news out from Hungary, except what we read 1n the newspapers t in the legal gazettes and so on. So what legally happened we knew, but that in these three months, half the Jews of Hungary were sent to to to Auschwitz. It was practically unknown. Uh here the Red Cross played a very uh un... ..
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   A:Unhelpful? |
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q:Unhelpful role. They kept some of the reports from as | we know now from Budapest and the Jewish organizations and didn't ! 11 deliver them to the people who who were uh meant to receive them. They are direct requests from the Jewish community to give these reports and we received them a month later when uh nothing could be done anymore.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q:We need to talk more about the Red Cross and we need to talk more about Hungary, but I want to stop you right here and ask you something more about Auschwitz, because its its come up in aontext. Uh there is, of course, uh an argument from some of the scholarly literature that while the outside world knew generally what was going on in terms of the extermination camps and so forth, that it did not know about Auschwitz, Birken...not know specifically about the gas chambers and and crematoria at Birkenau, uh even up until the middle of 1944. Do you want to to comment on that?
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   A:Well, that's probably true, that we didn't know. Uh we knew that things were happening in all kinds of places, but the uh concrete knowledge about the gas ovens, where they were exactlyw uh came much later, and the the report of the two Slovakian Jews was certainly a revelation for for all of us. Uh they...there was .. also another report from a Polish officer which came at the same time. Yeah. And we are certainly also seen, uh but the the...also the...how the camp was organized, how the...where the gas ovens were placed, how the...around the the the towers, the watch towers, how this was...this was really the first time that we heard the I [ [ I; 12 Â¢ real inside from this report which came terribly late, in June | 1944. Uh and even this 1s very strange why it took so long to to I get out. Therews a story that it was given to the in | and it never arrived or or took several months to arrive in [ in Rome, for instance. Now we got this this report uh in two ways in Geneva. The first uh copy arrived through the Slovak underground at the office of the Czechoslovakian representative to the League of Nations with whom I very closely cooperated during the whole war, Dr. . Uh he had...I think I have mentioned it...he wrote very closely with one of his uh...with one...with one of our colleagues who was Czechoslovak, so . Dr. and when the the report arrived, he called and asked him to bring it to me and to...he asked me to make a condensation of the report, which I did. In four or five pages~..this report was...I don't know...forty pages or thirty pages, uh and this this condensed report I gave them not only to him who transmitted it to London, but also to the British and to the Americans and the conden6ation has been used many...it comes out in many...1n many ways. I saw, for instance, the American ambassador in in London. He sent it to all kinds of people. It's exactly the same text in which I made. The second copy came uh...I .. 1] would say a few...a few days or a week or ten days later, and arrived and came from the uh Budapest Palestine office, uh Mr. , and was addressed to the president's office in in Geneva. It came out through a man who died these days, . Uh he had some facilities as a secretary of a consulate, and 13 he used uh also Romanian and other couriers to bring these things out. Uh it was addressed to the uh Palestine of f 1CQ but in reality, and here is a strange thing, Montello opened the the uh the envelope and gave it to uh in Switzerland who was the exchange telegraph agency or something. Uh the agency doesn't exist anymore...one of the uh uh telegraphic agencies which existed at the time. The fact that he gave this to telegraph agency was, of course, completely unauthorized and really not in order. On the other hand, it was very successful. It uh...for the first time, the swiss censor authorities didn't stop it, and this was not the merit of (laughter) of Montello but the fact that...1t showed that the war had finally changed and the success in the war was on the other side, and to our great astonishment, the Swiss let it go. Uh who has really the merit for this decision, I I don't know. I never found out, but it was a very important step which was then claimed by Montello as as his great success, but let me not touch this claim. Uh important was the fact that for the first time a detailed report on Auschwitz came out, and I would say that before this report, and this is a great merit for these two Slovakian Jews, uh that for the first time this came in the public. Also much too late, of course. Much too late. our understanding, of course, was clear. The the terrible things and the people were killed and so on, but the details in which...how this was...I would say, but of course, this was many years ago, and maybe some of it I forgot, but I would say that this was a decisive moment to give us inside knowledge of of how this thing happened. 14
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q:Well...I 1, of course, will not quarrel with your judgment of uh decisive moment, but sometime you and I will talk about some of the earlier documents which came out about AuschwitzBirkenau. There are earlier reports, not so detailed...
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   A:No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not saying that we we didn't know. Of course we knew and we knew also that there were uh uh hard labor and and and we were in contact, but uh there were documents, you could really accept as as as...this was really .
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q:Can you give us an approximate date when you received report, when you had to summarize it? Approximately.
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   A:No, noF There is...I have established this very clearly, because uh there is a detailed story in the report about the...a Czechoslovakian group which was in...transferred from Theresienstadt to Ausford...Auschwitz in quarantine. And this is the first time that we hesrd quarantine. And for six months in quarantine and afterwards it was liquidated and in the report also was stated that in a few lines under this what I just mentioned, another group from Theresienstadt arrived for six months in quarantine. And when I...and this I discovered when I was writing condensed report, and when I saw this I looked at the calendar, 15 and saw that there was five days left for the second six months in quarantine. I stopped working...
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q:When was that? f
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   A:I this was this was *must have been the 13th of June, I something.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q:OK.
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A:I believe that received the report on a Saturday or a Friday evening, and we were informed on a Monday morning, and then I immediately worked on it and fixed the dates. When I saw this, that there were five days and a group of Czechoslovakian young people, mostly of , uh were certain to be exterminated in a in a few days, I stopped my work on the condensation of the report, called a taxi, jumped in the taxif and went to . And in the taxi I wrote a story for the BBC. The idea was the BBC should day and night tell the people that publicly, the public, that we know that such a group will be gassed within five days. Uh and when I came to , this this uh given the the draft (laughter) which I I wrote on on my personal note paper, uh uh 1s still there. We we found it. And uh immediately agreed, but he really didn't...he didn't send it to London, to his government. He knew that there was a representative of the BBC in Bern, a Mrs. _ , a very well-known uh | 16 journalist, and he addressed it to her, and uh as a matter of fact all these papers we we have today. We have copies and we see it, and , in fact, sent the the the the report to BBC and it was uh transmitted a number of times. When I told the story once, the one of the Czechoslovakian inmates of uh uh Auschwitz, uh he said yes, I heard it. I said how dld you hear this story. He said I was in Auschwitz. I said, you had a radio? He said yes, we had a radio. This was the father of the historian Kolka (ph), Arthur Kolka. The the old man, he has a book, and uh he assured me...this is the astonishing thing...he assured me that this...on the basis of this report from the uh from BBC, they could manage to hide this this group in other barracks. I said...he said I don't... cannot assure you that they survived. At that moment, we saved them. Whether they...later I cannot tell you. But it showed me what extraordinary (laughter) methods you had to uh use in order to save them. It was a crazy idea that I jumped in and stopped writing of the report and I sent this report to London. But you had to have and this is my, perhaps one of my greatest criticism uh with regard to Jewish organization, that they were too much following the normal routine in their work. You had to have extraordinary ideas, crazy ideas, ideas...T say it openly, in order to because it was an extraordinary situation. I give you another example which also uh uh I have sometimes told. In Jerusalem, the head of the Department of the Jewish Agency was Greenbaum (ph), a very respected man, uh particularly respected by us in the World Jewish Congress because E 17 of his past as a Deputy in the Polish . He was really the greater fighter in the inter-war years for Jewish rights in the Polish . Uh very courageous. Uh he left Poland, I don't know exactly when, and went to Palestine. He was a Zionist. He was was from the radical party, but a great fighter for human rights, for for civil rights and so on. Now one day, I get a telegram from Greenbaum in which he asked me to find his son. I have this completely confused. A man like Greenbaum asked me to find in Poland, son, and also what's going on. I couldn't sleep for several nights. I had great respect for the man, and I said well, after all, the son, the father, son...he looks...I have to do something. But it was crazy. How can I find a son who's in some camp, if he 18 still alive? Who knows. And I decided to try a crazy idea. I sent ten little parcels to ten different camps with the name of the son of Greenbaum, and I found him. Here shows...you really had to go ways and use methods which were not the normal. So I decided the nine packages will be lost, and somebody may get them. But I found it. I'm not...I'm just using this opportunity to show that you had to to use absolutely unusual methods, and it was...now let's go back to the action of the of the War Refugee Board and what was. .what was...can be put to a certain degree on on it's credit.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q:You're talking about Hungary and how you knew very little from March to June 1944, but do you want to talk a little bit afterwards, what happened...? . Â» ! 18 0
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A:Now, when when this when when this uh news came and I said the second copy of the Auschwitz report came to the Zionist...to the Palestine office, and there was added already the statistics of the Jews in the provinces who had been killed, who had been uh transported to Auschwitz and who were dead. Uh we...from that moment on when this was clear, and there was really &gt; a very important, concerted political action to save what could still be saved of the Hungarian Jews, and uh at this...in reality F the only political action which was undertaken by the Allies in this respect. By the others and not only by the others . The F first step I think was undertaken by the King of Sweden. The Swedish section of the World Jewish Congress, had something to do with it. He sent an appeal to , the head of the Hungarian state. More important was the action undertaken by the American government, and that is a unique action really. They uh...the American government addressed a note to a country with which it was at war. This is unusual. It's really a break of normal methods, and uh warned them that if they uh...this policy of extermination would go on, the consequences they would have to bear and there was attached a special note, appeal by Roosevelt himself, a statement, in this uh request. And this was officially transmitted by the Swiss as intermediaries...they they were representing American interests in in Hungary and it was a direct note. This certainly made a great impact. The fact that the greatest state in the western alliance addressed such a very strong . I 19 uh note to the Hungarian government made a great . There was also an action by the Pope. It's the only time that the Pope addressed a telegram direct telegram to to and of the Jewish . Uh and finally there's the action in which I was also involved uh uh by the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, uh in which was equally addressed personally to to . There is in the literature somebody has written about it said that the note was transmitted really very late when the action was practically over. That is not the full story in my opinion because because the the legation, the Hungarian legation in in uh Bern was fully informed about this, and they they made this appeal may have reached in direct ways already. All this together had a decisive uh uh result and and stopped for a certain time the deportations. Then later there was ..for months we fought against the attempt to to re-introduce the the old policy, and uh this is...these months are really very confu6ed. There are all the time initiatives to uh continue the action to send people to Auschwitz, to continue to send them to labor and and put them into labor battalions and so on, and the , but as we know today, particularly the uh representative of of the Red Cross in in Budapest, two of the finest representatives, were very active and counter-acted these things all the time, 50 I cannot say it was a full success, but I can say there was a real struggle going on, a fight which lasted for months, and we denounced publicly all the negative uh uh features of this fight. In reality, all this...and we...very important was in this respect or 20 to the action of the World Council of Churches which was still in formation, but they had a very uh strong group there, _ and others, and the initiative uh uh was of the World Council with Mark was the president of the International Red Cross, was really done on my request, and I gave him all the uh the documentation and the arguments and and uh I've...we did the I used them too and they were, of course, more successful than we. There status was... a very religious person and this 1s today often called the decisive thing which happened there. In reality this was a cooperative uh effort by them and us and uh very much based on the documentation which I gave them. Uh but uh...

   Q:Let me stop you here because I think the tape is about to run out. OK. We've got two minutes left. Go ahead... ".
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: What uh happened finally there there was a very important action on the spot with regard to uh protection of Jews which the Red Cross and the Swedish and the Swiss and uh other diplomatic representatives undertook, and all together it saved practically the Jews of . Those who survived to a great extent owe this to this concerted action and I uh...this 1s really the only political effort undertaken during the whole war in which this was tried out from all uh sides. Everybody knows today Wallenberg and what he did. There are the same uh uh activity was undertaken by of the Swiss representation, and the Red Cross gave also protection papers. I remember very well one day Professor who 21 was Vice President, called me in and asked me uh...we are under terrible pressure we should give more protection papers, but the more protection papers we give, the less value they have. What's your opinion? I said give protection papers, Professor , this is not Switzerland. This is uh uh uh a land where law and order is not reigning yet right here. Give them...a Jew a chance to survive. How...how...see how the situation is. A man is in the street, and he will be arrested by uh policemen or soldiers, and then either he has a piece of paper, protection paper, or he has not, and if he has not, he has no chance. If he has a a...then it depends on the man with whom he has to deal. Either he is in a good mood or he 1s in a bad mood. He slept well with his wife last night, or not. They squabbled or not. It will depend on the local situation and and the human relationship. Give them a....give them a chance, and he gaue them the chance and he ordered that many more uh such papers would...protection

   Q:...because they're ready for us. Uh we were talking still about about Hungary and the cooperation in Hungary for the first time in a political action. Uh cooperation..(inaudible)...
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   A:...until the end really it went and there were ups and downs all the time and the uh...you have probably seen the the record of uh Mr. who writes uh the story on the action of the Red Cross in in Hungary from day to day, and you see there also that I have been all the time involved. Practically every action which the Red Cross undertook was finally suggested by me. I didn't uh cease to to push them and to pressure them. Uh it had finally some result. Uh of course, there was also...this was not the only thing which I did. I published, for instance, in on Hungary five pamphlets, uh booklets with great uh documentation about what was going on, the taking out of Hungarian press and other things. This I published and sent around, published ; 23 anonymously~ to hundreds of people, press people, politicians and others. This was all known to the Red Cross too and uh I used it &gt; for the for the churches. I used it with other people. We WQ we really uh...the the the report of the two Slovakian Jews. I don't . know whether it's known...I I had them translated into French. I printed a little brochure in it and it was sent, printed in five S thousand copies anonymously because I couldn't (laughter) do it officially so it was illegally, 1t was was printed and and and distributed in five thousand copies 1n all over Switzerland. (clearing throat) Uh this this was very important. I left out some of the names in order not to make it...but this kind of things I did too and I wasn't only a diplomat. I was...(laughter) also at different times in our pressure group if you want, uh but but what I want to say is that the the uh the the Hungarian example which was, of course, the last year of the war, and we benefitted from the fact that uh generally speaking people knew that the war was lost for Germany, but that doesn't mean that the Germans didn't...that their action was not as cruel and as determined as all the others. They didn't accept that they had lost lost the war. Not at all. I mean what the the action which the Germans took, Eichmann and the others uh in in Hungary, was one of the most cruelest and the most determined and the most quickest... quickest action of the of of of extermination which which happened in the whole thing.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   Q:They had the years of experience too. I 24
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   A:. Now uh...I spoke about this but then connected with this and we should perhaps speak about this in in this connection is the uh the action which became also possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, that is the effort of the attempt to obtain certain...the liberation of a certain number of Jews by bribing some of the uh responsible people, who in the year of 1944, of course, were not so cocksure as they were before and they had their doubts whether the the the war would be won and they had their doubts what would happen to themselves, and they were afraid what would happen and there were all kinds of uh attempts to to save their own life, or at least alleviate... alleviate their situation. And this you see, I have heard, of course, of the various groups which were saved by such methods. There are the negotiations between Kastner (ph) and uh Baker, Sonny Meyer involved in a certain way. There's the action uh of and uh the the uh the Nazis to save twelve hundred Jews from from Theresienstadt. There is the same kind of attempt made by uh of the World Jewish Congress in Sweden through the...through Himnler and through the the Dr. Kellsen (ph) who who treated him and finally , head of uh the Swedish Red Cross. All this uh liberated a few thousand Jews. Every Jew who was liberated in Sweden was was again...there's no doubt about it, but it was, of course, a very limited action. Now in the Kastner case, there was the great attempt to use this uh for for a real big deal of...between the Nazis and the and the Allied uh uh... 25
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   Q:A million Jews... |
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   A:A million or ten thousand yeah what was it? I
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   Q:What was your opinion? Could that conceivably have been done?
  </p>
  <p id="34">
   A:No. This was...I mean for for men...for somehody who followed this from day to day from outside very closely, I saw that...how even the the small concessions under the license...the license which I got from the Americans, it was really sabotaged by the British and it was a license for $25r000~ I mean a ridiculous amount in reality. OK. They said if this 1s successful, we will give you more and so I don't uh taking , but when you saw how risky this these things were uh and there was a determination not to uh let the other side benefit from anything. Uh this was from ehe beginning for me a dream, that the the Allies would concede. This was was out of the question. I didn't object to their trying to negotiate and the whole effort was, in my opinion, rightly in in this effort to to drag on, to negotiate while Jews were still alive and could be talked about. This is, by the way, the same what happened in many ways in the ghettos in in in Poland and in in the Russian...uh some of the heads of the were very intelligent people and they they understood uh as long as they can put Jews to work, they are not killed. And they tried to to 26 prolong these periods, and and and to offered Jews for work in order to spare their lives. This was exactly the same. The the war is going to its end. They saw this. They felt it. It cannot go...1t was four years, four and a half years, and the uh came back and at once the armies, so every month we can keep people alive was was once again. Thi6 was absolutely normal and was very intelligent. It was a clear concept which some of the people in eastern Poland especially had and was was right. The same would be applicable to the efforts of of of Kastner and Brandt who who negotiated, but but there could come any decisive result was from my point of view completely uh uh .
  </p>
  <p id="35">
   Q:What about on the German side? I mean, you've you've implied that the Allies would never have agreed to supplying trucks and so forth. Do you think the high Nazi officials would have been willing to...
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   A:No.
  </p>
  <p id="37">
   Q:No?
  </p>
  <p id="38">
   A:No. My my...I have said what I think of the Nazi determination to disrupt the the one great thing which uh on which the regime was really united. There's no doubt about it. The the extermination of the Jews was one of the central goals of the of the Nazi regime, and that they would uh...individuals could make 27 concession and so this is another question, but the decisive, the leadership...no.
  </p>
  <p id="39">
   Q:You know that there's an argument that that uh going back to the winter of 1942-43, starting in Slovakia with the with with and Rabbi Weizmann (ph)...
  </p>
  <p id="40">
   A:Oh yeah. The whole thing is with Weizmann . But this is... Weizmann 1n uh his memoirs attacks me that I didn't support this. The the real reason is that I didn't know about it. This was kept from me. I don't know why. I've never see the Weizmann proposals until '45 when I was in New York and saw it in our uh in the files in New York. In Geneva it was never shown and his attacks against me is completely without foundation because I couldn't support anything which which didn't reach me. What I heard about this, ideas seemed to me wonderful and a man who...
  </p>
  <p id="41">
   Q:Yes. And Hitler would bargain over the the fate of remaining Jewry in 1943...
  </p>
  <p id="42">
   A:Well, I said something when I...when I told you why I believed in the fin...the plan for the final solution, why why I believed this was possible, and here is the American . The German Jew had seen the the development of the Nazi movement and and knew that they were...that this was their central object like 28 a part of their face, a center part of their face, on which they would never give in, and the and at the same time knowing their determination, their ruthlessness, their complete uh contempt for moral concepts and accepted what is useful to the German people as they understood and uh and this gives the answer. Jews in other countries who have been...have had a much more difficult life and history amongst the citizens of other countries than German Jews probably, uh had gone through difficult periods but had always found someway to come through, with terrible losses but somehow they arranged themselves. This was not possible with the Germans, and this only a German Jew who had learned, who followed the the Nazi movement from the beginning, could judge. The others had illusion.
  </p>
  <p id="43">
   Q:We haven't talked yet in detail about the possibility of bombing Auschwitz-Birkenau.
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   A:Well, let me let me perhaps before we come to this uh~..well we can take this now. I wanted to to take it in another...in another context but it doesn't matter. Uh this is one of the strangest things. For me, really I don't understand it~ I personally was involved in this~ I..very much. When the reports from Slovakia came out, of the two Slovakian Jews, and a few days later it came the reports from the Budapest Palestine office with theifigures. At the sate time there were already...I think in both reports attached the request to bomb the communication lines and I 29 Auschwitz. And both were done, was never done, and here I am before positive which I've never been able to sort...and I come and then speak about the why so little was done. Maybe there's one aspect in which we should come back on it. Uh the most important uh intervention in this in this case came from Weizmann, Chaim Weizmann, the first president of Israel, who was at the time the president of the Zionist World Organization, who did not interfere in any except in this case. In this case he wrote a letter to Winston Churchill. How important he must have felt about it. Uh he he kept completely to his line. He is not there for general Jewish uh interventions, affairs and so on. He is there to first the Zionist idea and so on. But here he made an exception. And he was successful in this exception. Weiman has has put this in a very good article which was published in commentary in which I have been consulted several times before he would, and it is absolutely clear that here something happened which is . The...Weizmann's intervention was not the only one. Wetll come back on this, but Churchill's impressed by Weizmann's letter and writes, let's try it. And Eden who was less than perceptive I believe toward our case, uh is impressed by Churchill's signature and adds his name, OX...let's try it. And then it goes to Sinclair (ph), up to to the the Minister of Air, who is a liberal, not a bad man, and from there it goes to the Chief of Staff, and from there it goes back to the Foreign... Foreign Office. And nothing is happening. And to us, and to me, to Goldman, so the deputy head of the extraditionary corps, the 30 the deputy of Eisenhower...I I don't remember the name...in America...
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   Q:McCoy you mean.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   A:Huh?
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   Q:John McCoy.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   A:No. It was not John McCoy. It was a general, a general. Uh I forgot the name. He he must...he mentioned it a number of times. I went to the British and the American Embassy. To the American Embassy, I gave them maps which I found in the in the League of Nations on the Upper Salasia in the twenties, early twenties. I said this was a popular boat, and there's . .. probably no better maps on this region than this, and I got with the help of the librarian of the League of Nations, I got copies of all these maps. I said this is the best you need, and I gave it to to the . This wasn't too easy to get such a thing. And they tell me it's not possible and they tell me it's too far and we cannot get back and they uh...it's too risky and we know today because not only they had the...in the year 1944, the Allies had the absolute air domination over the whole of Europe. Secondly, it's not true that they had no bombers that could fly. At the same time when we asked...by the way, this came up already earlier in in '43 or '4 that...not four, '43...someone...the ideal 31 came out _ , but it was...we made a concentrated effort in June '44. Uh at the same time when we asked, there were five bombardments of the camp of _ , five kilometers from Auschwitz. So why do they lie? Unbelievable...we cannot reach it and then they bomb at the same time. We know today that the air uh uh the photographs of the...
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   Q:Photo reconnaissance?
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   A:Yeah. There is in in London an office which has all these photos, detailed photos from the whole region, much better, of course, than what I could produce from the League of Nations. But why did...but they lied to us. They said some people...I called _. He was then the the General Secretary of the Congress in New York, and he had an idea not to bomb it but to send in commandos there and to makes an explosion from inside in order to reduce the number of victims, and then some historians said that was against bombing. (laughter) It was a more refined way of of reaching the same thing. But here this really leaves me without answer. And it particularly it shows the enormous role which bureaucracy has played. We have always discussed the Holocaust connection with Nazi bureaucracy. Uh we've seen how important the Nazi bureaucracy was in this, but here you see it suddenly that there's another bureaucracy which has played a very important role, a negative role, if men like like like like uh Churchill and Eden can give such instructions and nothing happened...because the | 32 bureaucracy doesn't like it. This is a very serious uh aspect of the whole thing, and uh...
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   Q:Was bureaucracy then one of the basic reasons why the Allies did so little in response to opportunities between...
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   A:Let's let's do this in a more systematic way. But thi6 is one of the factors which have certainly played a role. No doubt about it. Now we have said uh we have made a survey of what became possible thanks to the support of the War Refugee Board, but we have left out one, in my opinion, very important aspect, and that is the preservation of the camp inmates at the end of the war. I must tell you that from I would say probably October nineteen hundred forty-four on, I was...I had an obsession, a real obsession. I was dread the fearing that at the end...1t was clear that the war was over. It was clear it dragged on, the war dragged on but the the Germans had lost it, but the Germans who used children in the war effort and this was and I personally...maybe it's my education...I was afraid that the last effort in a kind of in Waggoner's context it's ...uh when everything 1s lost, they would at least see to it that the the rest of the Jews who were still alive, they would take them with them. And I was absolutely obsessed by the idea that in the last moments they will make a slaughter of the three or four hundred thousand Jews in the camps which were . And I couldn't sleep and I told myself, what can we do in order to stop this And I had at a .1 1 33 certain moment the idea, alright let's make a great effort, a joint effort of everybody together, because everybody is in the same boat. The French had their inmates in the camps, and the Czechs and the Poles and so on and so on, and I took the initiative to mobilize all the Allied forces in Geneva in order to organize a joint action to prevent this~ It wasn't too easy. I was stateless too, without government. There was no Israeli government. There was no Jewish government. There was no supported, and I took the initiative and I...the first question is who is neutral enough or in good relations with everybody that he could uh play this role, and I decided on the Czechoslovakian government, and I approached the delegate from Czechoslovakia at the League of Nations, and invite everybody, the French and the Belgians and the Dutch and the Yugoslav, and the Italian was in the meantime...and the Romanians were also and the Greek, and he did. And we had our first meeting I think was in November '44. I was in uh in 8ern that day and came a little late to the to the meeting, and I was very pleased to see all the representatives either of real government representatives or the representatives of the Red Cross Society offices, countries...they were all officials practically. It was the same. And uh and when I arrivedt he said the idea comes from Dr. Riegner. Let him explain to you what what he wants. And I uh explained to them that we we were all in the same boat and there was a great danger that this would happen, that at the last moments they would really suppress all the people in the camps and they were capable of doing it, and 34 we should do a last desperate effort to save this and to prevent this. And we discussed various ways, uh neutral countries or Red Cross and so on, and the idea...and there was very considerable support, but of course they couldn't decide. They had to ask their government, and uh we had several sessions. The last session was in in...the decisive session was in I think February. It went already in the next year because the governments are very slow in replying, and there we all agreed we should ask the International Red Cross for a very special, high-level mission to the political authorities of of of Germany to prevent it. And it was agreed and then these governments, they didn't have all relations between themselves and some didn 't recognize them, but they were all in agreement it should be done, and the idea was therefore not to to sign a joint paper but to...that everybody should submit this identical appeal to the President of the Red Cross uh for this purpose. And I wrote the text, and uh everybody signed it, and at a certain day between ten and eleven, they all submitted the the signed appeal to the Red Cross, and this led to the last great action of in Germany where he saw Carlton Brunner who was really the number two under under Himnler. Now when called together all these people and then when he came back, he called them again together, and I questioned him very, very thoroughly and this is also...I didn't just take his (laughter) assurances for granted. It opened up a certain number of activities for the Red Cross but I think much more important, it gave to the German government as a clear understanding that the whole Allied, all the 35 Allied governments together were determined not to let this happen. And it has...while events precipitated and military and others developed so quickly that all the _ were uh by-passed by new events all the time, so that uh the agreements, the real agreements which were concluded between and the the German Nazis, the moment they were done really already by-passed and the and it's not so important whether they were implemented or not. The the...it it created a decisive fact, political fact, that the the governments did not allow this to happen, and with few exceptions, it didn't happen. There are a few camps where they tried to kill people, and they killed some of them, but relatively limited. The action was, on the other hand, supported by the activities of who acted in the same line with the on behalf of the Swedish _ and I was in contact, telephone and otherwise, with _ in in in Sweden and we tried at least to to coordinate and inform each other what was going on. I believe that strangely the uh people have dealt with the Holocaust and the...and so the people who got saved and were spared, nobody really mentions this. I think it's one...I think this is...the War Refugee Board was supporting us very much on this. No doubt about it. The American government asked us to keep them informed and at later meetings, they were present. At the first meetings they were, I believe, not there. In the later meetings, the British government also was present. I mean, this was really...France and...was was a united front of the whole uh coalition of the Nazi question. And uh I can only say the the the result was that the life of most of the people 36 0 was respected, which I consider was not a matter which was going without . It was, by the way, not the only activity which this group undertook. We alao addressed ourselves in the last days of the war to the Allies, and that they should allow uh columns of trucks with food and other medical and so to go into the camps and to see. They should be not kept out because of military or bureaucratic reasons. And we had...the the same group intervened with the Allied governments on on on these matters and probably the results were quite positive, the reaction on this. Now I believe uh that uh Winston's man like Weinman says that the War Refugee Board saved two hundred thousand people or something such a figure, I I believe this is very questionable. All these figures are very questionable. Uh what _ makes the real uh calculations. I believe that the saving of the people, the inmates of the camps in the last moment is is is one of the most things which we reached, saying this was also a collective effort but I I don't think I exaggerate because I was involved in this. I believe really this is...made quite a difference. Now let me say something about why so little was done and why...what shall I say...why so little was done and why we have this...
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   Q:...between November '42 and January of '44.
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   A:Yeah. Well, we didn't save...the the War Refugee Board took eighteen months until the first and the only real action was undertaken and how many millions of people were uh were killed in . 1 37 the meantime. Now I, of course, have given more thought than most people uh because I was so deeply involved and I tried so hard and why did all this not lead to greater action. There is a whole series of factors. And I'll may mention them, but I'll come to the end to the most important uh reasons. Firstly, nobody was really prepared for such a thing. And this shows really the uniqueness of the Holocaust. That's for sure. This had never happened in history, that a whole people including the babies and old people and and invalids and men and women, children, that a whole people was condemned to be executed. It hasn't happened. And with all the catastrophes which have come over Jews during the course of history ...in the course of history, nobody really mentions such a thing. I mean they're just not prepared for this. This is the first time. The second is uh the atrocity...atrocity stories of the 1st World War...(break in tape) ...this came up all the time. During the Ist World War especially during the occupation by the Germans of Belgium, there came all kinds of stories what the Germans did and after the war it occurred that this was highly exaggerated and a good number of these stories were not true. Whenever I came as my reports and so on, I was going against this war. they called at that time, and this was a very great handicap for . I am not trying to underrating it. Number three, the secrecy. In spite of everything, this was a so- called secret undertaking. Uh has rightly said that many many people were involved but officially this was a secret uh operation, and not only was it a secret operation, this was an 38 operation for which a special language was invented which said complete different things which they meant. Where the uh ...all this meant meant uh a lot of other words and we are...was invented in order to make it clear that it shouldn't have been clear. The the most interesting in this is the the famous speech by Himnler to the...1n '43 to the heads of the SS or...where he said more or less he will never admit it and he action was a great national act of self-defense, but in which he said we will not leave any traces of it. I will never admit it.
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   Q:And yet it was being recorded as he was speaking?
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   A:Yeah. Now I have another letter such in my files by Himnler to Miller who was also one of the top people in the 1n the Third Reich security . Section 4. And this is interesting. .. Uh it's a very strange...a letter in which he refers to a report by Stephen Wise. You know this perhaps...
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   Q:Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   A:...of September nineteen hundred forty-two, in which Stephen Wise must have referred about my famous telegram and the report. We have never found really to what statement of Wise it refers. This 1s something for the for the scholars to to work on. And there's exactly...and he he he uh he speaks there as if uh of course the the the course of transporting so many people, of 39 course, many people die and so on. This is normal. And again, don't leave any trace also of the dead. It's clear and absolute deliberate effort to to hide the real facts and to eradicate any any traces which could be...it's a strange concept. If they are so proud, why...of their action, why why this secrecy.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   Q:I wrote in my book on Himmler that Himmler was torn by this conflict between the need to conceal, on the one hand, and the need to keep orderly records on the other.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   A:Yeah. Now then the next point is we have already talked about it a little bit but I think we should uh talk more about it...the anti-Semitism is the Allied camp. Now this is something uh perhaps at this moment where anti-Semitism is growing again in many places in the world and even in this country, but the generation the last thirty years, the American Jewish youngsters didn't suffer from anti-Semitism, and they don't...didn't understand that there was a very active anti-Semitic movement in this country in the '30's. Uh those who were feeling this movement were of course the Nazis to a great extent, but you had also your your own people. The Nazis with the and their own organization of the which were were appointed in all the countries to uh develop anti- or Nazi activities and anti-Jewish activities all over. Uh but you had your own people. Uh there were the the Father Coffmann who who was twice a week I think on the on the on the radio. The television didn't exist at the time. There was K. 40 D. Smith, another such uh public anti-Semite who who influenced it. It was a...and there was the German propagandist was extremely ably led and they the German propaganda accused Jews of America...they pushed Roosevelt into the war. This was...uh first of all, it wasn't true, but uh the Jews...it it prevented really Jewish activities for two years in the war. You don't find any traces of anti-Jewish uh persecutions in the in the newspapers from nineteen hundred forty until nineteen hundred forty-two. Uh the going to war was not popular in this country. Generally speaking uh this was one of the greatest problems for Roosevelt. He he wanted to to stop the the Nazi Germany. There's no doubt about it. His whole policy was...but he couldn't do it because he...the feeling that America shouldn't be involved and the isolationism of America was was enormously strong. And to to to accuse the the the Jews...they pushing into the war, they are the the the war mongers. They are the the responsible for...it it...this was a terrible (inaudible)... and in fact it had its effect on the Jewish community. It restricted them. They were much...they were really afraid of this uh accusation and and and and therefore terribly restricted and restrained. So...and it was highly efficient uh action...way of of uh... uh uh extremely uh successful propaganda in favor of the Germans and the Nazis. Now uh...but we had it even in the government. We spoke about it. In fact the whole story of how my telegram at first was received, how instructions were given not to accept any more messages from private persons or private organizations. The the uh sabotage of I Â« 41 [the the rescue effort, the rescue uh plans after the April '43 telegram, uh these all...the whole question of visas. I know that our greatest problem as German Jews was the American visas, and there was a limited number. I think twenty-four thousand or something for German...people of German...and we found out at the end of the war they were never filled. Why?
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   Q:You see this as more the result of anti-Semitism than the result of bureaucracy or a combination of the two?
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   A:I think both. But here I think the...I think the man who is responsible to a great extent is 1s as I said Breckenridge , and he uh in my opinion, pursued the policy to keep Jews out of America.
  </p>
  <p id="63">
   Q:And there were a whole bunch of State Department people who...
  </p>
  <p id="64">
   A:There were others too. There were others too. There were others too, and uh I don't know whether Roosevelt was aware of it or not. In any case the lady who comes out very well is Mrs. Roosevelt who tried very hard but didn't succeed either. She she came in several times with schemes for Jewish children and so on that...but when you turn to...from from America to Britain, you have the same. There it has an anti-zionist flavor, that the whole time uh uh 1s valid both for the Foreign Office and the 42 Colonial Office, and you have a very good study by about this and it's pages and pages where you where you see what the bureaucracy did in order not to be helpful. There's uh...sometimes ...we haven't spoken about these little boats which were sent to Palestine from Bulgaria and and Romania with a few hundred Jews, and when you read the reports of the Foreign and Colonial Office people, you ask yourself, now who is the enemy. Is it the Jews or the Germans? And you definitely feel that it is the Jews. It's unbelievable I mean even when you read it today, but it takes takes the establishment of the War Refugee Board, the reports and the and the British Foreign Office uh...they don't say anything else that the the establishment of the War Refugee Board is uh uh a method by Roosevelt to gain the Jewish votes in the election.
  </p>
  <p id="65">
   Q:And they were . A.....that there could be a humanitarian idea behind it that you wanted to to help people who are gravely in danger. Nothing. I mean it's unbelievable when when you read it, and these are the people who who were on your on your side. They ran it. He was...there's no doubt that this played a great role in your , the bureaucracy and the anti-Semitism, the anti-Semitic bureaucracy was able to prevent. Now uh...but in in in...connected with this there is a...the insensitivity of high...of people in high position, and I am particularly mentioning the military. What what we have said about the effort to bomb Auschwitz, not to bomb 7.,~ | 43 / AuschwitZ how this 1s possible. I said why did one write it. To all our uh arguments and how often did I argue, they...we always got uh they have to win the war. I said yes, but you will...you want to win the war in order to save the people who are threatened. Yeah, this is uh...we cannot make any any exceptions. Now they tell me in in in in Auschwitz when they bombed the , they couldn't have two or three uh bombs left for the for the gas uh chambers. Wasn't so easy for us to take the decision, but the...all fact responsible are this bombing would kill another number of Jews. Of course. But you would have stopped the extermination process. Every day six thousand people killed. So of course we had to say better to stop the the the the extermination process and even if it costs some lives, but where is this ....how is 1t possible that all the high military people, that nobody even made some kind of an effort to understand this and to help. It didn't cost and didn't divert anything from the war effort. Is there something wrong in our moral...
  </p>
  <p id="66">

  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A:No. I think...I don't think it 1s...no, I don't think it was anti-Semitism. It was insensitivity, and and concrete...you are a soldier. You have to do your job and so on. But as I told you, you can also have feelings. And if it doesn't harm your job, why why why can~t you do something. Explain to me that uh we know I 44 today that big boats came with soldiers over the ocean, with tens of thousands of soldiers, and they went back empty, and when we were asking for visas and for transport, they said there's no transport. They couldn't fill these boats. Why did they lie? come back to this. Why did they lie? There's no place...there were enormous space. This was empty. . But here 1s something wrong and insensitivity. I don't think they they ever thought of it, and this is the wrong thing. The soldiers and and the high officials in government, also , and there something was wrong.

   A:All what I have said is...has influenced the situation. But I believe there are two points which are really decisive. The first 1s the complete powerlessness of the Jewish people at that time of history. It's very difficult for the generation of today to understand it. we have today a rather influential Jewish community in the United States. We have today a Jewish state which is uh has been very successful in the last forty years with militarily, politically, which has had great influence on many understand this, and not to compare the situation of today with the situation forty or fifty years ago. That has to be learned and that's one of the most important problems in Jewish education you have to understand. Today we are a different Jewish people. We have learned from the Holocaust. We have learned from our isolationism. We have learned that we can and decisive moments only count on . You cannot apply the ways or or position of organizing uh protests of 1990 and 1940. The great number of these methods were not available. There were certainly not available during the war. The police would have chased the protesters away from the White House or wherever uh in a in a minute, and the real thing is that we had no influence at the time. This is . And the second uh third truth is that what happened was so terrible and so beyond any human understanding that people really couldn't believe it. And I'm saying this meaning both Jews and non-Jews. And concurs in one of his books in a very able way exemplified this point. To exterminate a whole people including babies and sick people and...is something, and and and to throw babies into gas ovens, burning the human beings alive and then...is something which we...goes beyond any human understanding and . And therefore, we have to distinguish between knowing the facts and accepting facts. After the declaration of the Allied governments in December of '42, everybody knew. And we thought now something will happen, decisively will happen. But in reality, the people who had under...had signed this declaration had great doubts whether this was really happening. And Jews themselves...I would ! : 47 say that many people who knew, who learned, who spoke about it, had in their inner hearts somewhere a reflection...I hope this is all not true. You cannot...this cannot be true. I give you a few examples. In nineteen hundred forty-three, I got one day from the Union of Polish 3ews in America, a package with thirty thousand addresses in Poland to whom I was supposed to send packages. When I received this package, I got nearly crazy. This organization had its seat in the same building and I believe even on the same floor as the American and World Jewish Congress to whom to whom all my reports went. They must have read all my reports. I asked myself, they have still not understood it. But it wasn't this. They had read it and they had understood it, but they couldn't accept that their own families were included in the . It cannot be. None of these thirty thousand addresses were valid anymore. They people had been evacuated or had been killed already or had been in the in the camps. Not one was . But you couldn't sit 0 and do nothing. You have to do something. And you're excluded you own family. Alright. I know that many many people are sacrificed and killed, but not my family. This cannot be true. And so they collected that something has to be done, so they collected the addresses, and . They never got . I couldn't do anything but here you have the schizophrenic reaction. Knowing, but not...somehow not believing or taking exceptions for yourself. The story of is well known. It has been often repeated. When when when he went to Frankfurt and and and and and uh I can't believe it, and then he said, you mean I ama, 48 liar. He said no, I didn't say that you are a liar. But I said I can't believe it. But this is one of the most respected Jews in this country. When wise got my first uh report, he sits down and the next day or two days later and writes to Frankfurt and tells him and and really shares with him his terribly despair. What can one do, but tell the the . He Frankfurt he probably did. I'm sure he did. Uh there's another story of uh which was given by Professor de Young, who is one of the authors of the classic work on the uh deportations from Holland, and he was a young man and and and the government of exile in Holland during World war IJ, and was in charge of radio emissions, and he gets hold of some of my reports, and he reports in a lecture he gave in Washington...no, in Harvard, some time ago, and uh tells the story how he gave these reports to the Prime Minister of Holland, . tells...uh returns these reports a few days later to him and says, you believe in this stuff? But worse even, who I made mentioned before who was Secretary General of the World Jewish congress during that last period of the War, uh there was in 1944 in November a great conference called by the World Jewish Congress in Atlantic City which really sets out a post-War program of the Jewish people. It's a very important document. Uh it's really...it was the next twenty years what Jewish...the Jewish community in in the world has pursued as goals and so on is defined there. Astonishing how how good the document is, a very important contribution to Jewish planning and Jewish policies in the post-War. And goes to a number of ministers . .' 49 with the delegation of the assembly in Atlantic City and he meets amongst other people uh the uh Vice Minister of the Defense, McLoy. You mentioned him before, and they submit the official documents and tell him to speak about it and so on, and McLoy, a very respected man in the government of this country and who played a very important role after the War as a high commissioner in Germany and so on, a lot of other important functions, asked _ to remain behind when the uh delegation retired. And he says and there's a report by and it's been published...I don't remember where but I've read it and he said...so McLoy says to him, while now as we are alone you can admit this is all propaganda. This is December nineteen hundred forty-four, five months before the War was over and the number two man in the government on on the war effort doesn't believe it. Now this shows uh there was really the people didn't believe. This shows that it was so beyond any human (inaudible tape) human conditions, that you couldn't believe it. this was of course one of the most negative things and it cost us millions of lives. Now I'm not taking away the terrible consequences, that on the other end it's uh perhaps the most hopeful thing in the whole history of the of the Holocaust... ..

  <p id="69">
   Q:In retrospect..
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   A:In retrospect. It means that man cannot live with absolute evil. You cannot accept absolute evil. There is some way E 50 the conviction that man is good, man is pure. Man is not condemned to the worst, and this...it's a paradox. When...many Jews do not like when I say this, because they cannot forget... cannot forget either this , but the fact that man cannot accept this, and man could not accept it, gives you hope in the man of tomorrow. It is really the most positive conclusion you can have. In this world of darkness, you cannot despair of men.
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   Q:Let me ask you something about something that was not specifically on your list of things that uh or explanation provided for so little done. Uh you mentioned the insensitivity of high officials, but you didn't talk specifically about President Roosevelt. You probably know that uh some of the books on the subject, particularly David Weiman's book uh Single Out Roosevelt is is a major factor, perhaps the major factor. Tell us a little bit about your assessment of Roosevelt.
  </p>
  <p id="72">
   A: Well, it's of course very difficult for my generation to to make a final judgment on this. We work...we uh uh were educated in uh in a world and this was where it was the only hope, and later judge. Uh and of course the study of uh the war record of the American government shows that uh all kinds of opportunities were lost and were not used, and the political responsibility is certainly borne by Roosevelt to a great extent. But on the other hand, he is the only one who can say...uh could say that this policy has also prevailed, to preserve some Jews. I spoke of lend I ; 51 lease. Lend-lease has saved probably Britain and probably more than Britain. I think that this _ thanks to lend and lease and the...of course the resistance of the British people that they survived, and with this survival, four hundred thousand Jews in Britain have been saved from the invasion of of the Nazis and would have been victims. But another conservation is even more important. If Britain would have gone under, Palestine would have gone under. It was very near that the Nazis came into Egypt and Palestine. There are six hundred thousand Jews and much more. Can you imagine that the Nazis would have wiped out the Jews in Egypt and in Palestine in 1942 or '3 or '4. Our whole world...our whole Jewish world wouldn't exist. With the center of Israel today is a powerful factor for every aspect of Jewish life. That's also due to the Allied effort and Roosevelt had an important stake in it. That doesn't mean that I'm not...I'm defending and the inactivity. I think he bears a great responsibility but he and Churchill are the only ones who on the other hand have also contributed to the preservation of the free world, and that cannot be completely forgotten either.

  <p id="73">
   Q:A couple of times we've mentioned in passing the role of the uh the Vatican and the International Red Cross. Uh it seems to be in this section about why was so little done, uh we need to come back to them and talk a bit more about . Perhaps what they did, but also what they could have done and did not do. | 52
  </p>
  <p id="74">
   Q: Well, on the vatican I have once given a great lecture on the vatican and on the World Council of Churches. Uh they have...there has been very little done. Uh I spoke, I believe, of the memorandum which we gave to the in Bern in nineteen hundred forty-two, and the only result of this was uh that some action was taken with regard to Slovakia and the deportations of Slovakia were interrupted, stopped for a certain time. This was a Catholic priest who was at the head of the government. Uh in all the...I have spoken on the action taken in in Hungary by the Vatican and here I believe that the vatican and the the Nuncio who was in Budapest has tried to and cooperated with the general effort to preserve the Jewish community, and even the local bishops and uh were influenced in this way. But generally speaking, the situation depended on this the personal courage and the personal determination of the leaders in the various countries. And you have examples of courage and determination and you have examples of complete uh laissez-faire. Some of the bishops and archbishops...you have beautiful examples in France like Cardinal of Toulousse, who went to the station where the deportations from where the deportations took place, and his presence was an act of protest. There were some other bishops...Bishop , Bishop .. , but there were also other cardinals who supported the vichary regime fully, and the Vatican never interfered even in the French anti-Jewish legislation when it was asked whether..of his opinion. the Vatican in my opinion, and there there are twelve or thirteen volumes of vatican documents what uh what they were doing | 53 during the War, I believe that the real problem in the catastrophe of the...which happened to us was never taken seriously by the Vatican until the War was practically over, and I believe that there was no real realization in the highest uh levels of the Vatican bureaucracy, uh no real evaluation of the out...of of the the the dimensions of the catastrophe, and I believe that the Vatican was better informed maybe than we believe. There are hundreds and hundreds of priests. and we were not prevented from and there are books who report on this, on these reports. In the official documentation, it shows that some uh priests reported very clearly about the about the elimination of the Jews and the killing of Jews. When prohibited Wise to publish my famous it was agreed that they should ask opinion of the Vatican and the opinion of the Vatican was very wishywashy. They said we have also reports but uh it doesn't...on on that treatment, but they didn't confirm the elimination. Astonishingly, because , the who reports regularly to the Vatican and who writes about the same time the new things are the bombardments of the state, of the cities, and the uh increased elimination and extermination of the Jews and there are already more than two million exterminations. So one cannot tell me they didn't know. Uh in some places, the local bishops helped. The action of the vatican centrally was practically limited to Hungary. There they tried a certain influence, but otherwise I wouLd say there was no real great concern. And uh I often uh thought that my long conversation with uh with Monseigneur Montini 54 in 1945 when the war was over and I was asked to plead with him the Catholic authorities should help us to recuperate the Jewish children who had been hidden by Catholic authorities or Catholic individuals and when I argued with him...this was November 1945...and said that we had...we were very grateful to the Catholic Church for what it had done in order to save some Jews, Jewish children especially, but we had lost in the war one and a half million Jewish children, and we couldn't loose one more child. He questioned me, he questioned this statement and was absolutely astonished when I gave him the statistical background to my _ . For twenty minutes we argued. I told him, you know, there were in Poland...the birthrate...was a birthrate...a Jewish birthrate of sixty thousand every year. Multiply by 16, 16...you can...you arrive at 960,000 children, up to the age of sixteen. We should have in 1945 at the end of the War, found 960,000 Jewish children in Poland. Do you know how many we found? Something like 3,640 kids. There 1s a report by uh Jewish leader, Louis Seeger who comes back from Poland and brings these figures. take Hungary. Hungary with Transylvania, territories which belonged...we call to Romania, about eight hundred thousand Jews. There were about four hundred thousand in the Hungarian provinces. On an average, there should have been a hundred thousand Jewish children. Maybe a little less...e1ghty thousand. When the war was over, how many Jewish children did we find? Eight children. He was shaken when I told him and I continued. I was well prepared to go on. He said they they they left. There was immigration. 55 | I said where was immigration. Perhaps a few hundred, for there I were still was to the mountains of Romania, but it's terribly difficult. Not thousands...for twenty minutes we argued. It was one of my most unsuccessful diplomatic _ in my whole career. I shook him, there's no doubt. He...for the first time he realized that six million Jewish dead meant a million and a half Jewish children, but if the number two or three in the uh...

  <p id="75">
   Q:Hierarchy...
  </p>
  <p id="76">
   A:Hierarchy...the the Catholic hierarchy, had to learn from me to realize in November when it was 1945, what this meant, this shows that uh not very high priority was given to these problems in the Vatican, and uh the other example is I mentioned already several times. He went to the Vatican in August nineteen hundred forty-two...uh '45, supported by some very important Catholic uh scholars, including Jack who became later the cardinal, became the French Ambassador to the Holy See, a very important, very distinguished Catholic scholar, including uh the uh priest in in in uh who became a cardinal later whose name escapes me at the moment, who has written a very important book also in Catholic-Jewish relations, including uh a prelate of Egyptian-Jewish origin. A whole series of very uh distinguished Catholic theologians and they argued that this was a time for the Holy See to issue a Jewish on the relations with the Jews. There was no reply, and it took twenty years until vatican Council 56 II that the church really found that it had to issue a statement on the future of Christian-Jewish relations, a very important statement . It's a beginning of a new approach to the Jews, but you see here the.. all these indications show that certainly the Jewish catastrophe was not seized in all its terrible dimensions and it had certainly not priority in the considerations of the vatican at the time.
  </p>
  <p id="77">
   Q:What about the role of the International Red Cross?
  </p>
  <p id="78">
   A:The International Red Cross, you have today a very important study by Professor , uh the Geneva historian who has...is the only one who had access to all the files, and the result of this study is not very positive to say the least. There are two positive things which I have to say sbout the Red Cross. The one is the fact that uh , Vice President, concerned to us in 1942 that he had also news about uh the final solution and that he had heard from several German diplomatic witnesses that the final solution was in in execution. This was a positive, a very positive fact for us to determine and to inform the Allies that this was a reality. The second is the negotiations which I mentioned before with and certainly contributed to to help prevent the extermination of the people who were still in the camps at the end of the war, but apart from this, the attitude of the Red cross was uh not very helpful, and not very uh courageous. There was a moment when some of the members of the Red Cross really 57 felt they had to make an open protest against amongst other things the treatment of the Jews. Uh or at least an appeal in which these matters would be open...openly denounced but uh it never came to this appeal or public protest. It's...although I must admit there was a majority of the members of the International Committee who were in favor of such . But here the Swiss government intervened and prevented any such declaration. Uh I've been often asked whether this should have happened or not. In my opinion, there are moments for international organizations, welfare organizations, where you have to speak out, and I was asked by the Red Cross at the time...I clearly recommended and pushed and was very active in order to that such a statement of denunciation should happen, but it didn't happen and was prevented, as I said, by the swiss government which was afraid of the Germans. Uh but nevertheless, at certain moment our insistence of decisive action had some result. There was in 1942, in September '42, and the dates are very important because this is the moment where we informed uh _ that we knew about the final solution and he confirmed to us that he knew too. Uh there the Red Cross sent a memorandum to their delegation in Germany in which uh they left it to the decision of the delegation if they should uh submit to the German authorities uh a request for the extension of the basic rules of Red cross protection to the intern...1nterned people in the various camps and not in the camps of prisoners of war and the other camps. Uh this activity, this action had no consequences. That was the most serious. They kept me in the belief for two I 58 years that they were pushing on this constantly and there were always new interventions in this sense. This is just not true. 's book makes it very clear that until the uh situation developed in Hungary in 1945 which we have described, practically nothing has has happened, and this is in my opinion a very serious mistake and uh very serious failure of the Red Cross. Moreover, the book of _ brings out a number of very unpleasant facts. For instance, the Red Cross accepted without protest a request of the German Red Cross that...I think it's 1941...1t could be '42...that in the future inquiries about people who are lost...who are searched for, should in the future be submitted separately for aliens and non-aliens. That they accepted this distinction is certainly a scandal and certainly not in the line of uh Red Cross principles, and there are a number of other such incidents which are certainly not very good and show also the the very limited courage which the Red Cross had in countering the Germans. There's a historian who has...a Swiss historian, Mr. Paul Stouffer, who has denounced this attitude in an article concerning the case of . The twelve thousand Polish officers were murdered by the...by Russians. At the time, the uh German government and the Polish government in exile both asked the International Red Cross to establish an inquiry commission in order to determine who was responsible for this act. Uh behind all this was the government...was the propaganda ministry and uh the Red Cross could not accept the proposal because the third party hadn't and the third party were the Russians, and according to the principles of ! 59 the Red Cross only when all involved could agree...could such a question could such an inquiry commission be established, but Mr. Stouffer refers in this respect to the diaries of . Uh of course, the Germans were very upset that this inquiry commission didn't happen. Uh but in the diaries of uh he defends himself and says we couldn't make a big fuss about this case. We are much too much depending on the International Red Cross concerning our own interests with regard to prisoners of war and other other interned people in Allied countries and so on, which shows exactly that the Red Cross disposed of higher prestige and status in Germany when they believed themselves and all their hesitations not to insist too much with the Germans because of the overwhelming power of the Germans, uh it..at the time is here really contradicted by one of the greatest witnesses one could produce in which it said we depend on the good will of the Red Cross. This has never been taken serious and never been realized but by the responsible people in in Geneva. So the Red Cross today doesn't anymore really defend this position. For the first time under the new president there, , I saw recently articles in which they said yes, we didn't do enough at the time, but now we have another policy and so on so. And this is in a not the attitude uh of the deal on these matters much more in detail in my own autobiography. I was very much involved in the whole theater of Red Cross activities, and the book by you see day by day for how I pressured the Red Cross into action in the Hungarian uh case and uh also in's book, there are I think 45 references I 60 to my activities uh but it was certainly a very important activity also from our side and some of it produced results but, of course, much too limited.

   Q:We have a little less than ten minutes to go. I was going to ask you about uh relations with the Jewish agency and the Joint, but if you have something that you would rather say that has not come out yet, please feel free to take this time.
  </p>
  <p id="80">
   A:No, we can speak about the the the nations that say they cooperation of the Jewish organizations in Geneva. I'm not speaking now on the on the world. Uh there have been very little described really. We were not very good. With the agency I had very good relations with the head of the agency in Geneva, , who was an old diplomat of the Zionist movement. He was even more pessimistic than I was, and so pessimistic that he really gave up doing things. He has written enormous amount of letters in describing his despair, which 1s...I didn't do this. I uh was afraid partly of the censorship. Everything which we wrote went through censorship and I didn't want the , but uh there was...cooperation was alright. There were all kinds of uh little offices between which there was a good deal of jealousy, but while I was at the time upset by some of these personal problems, when you see it as a whole and it didn't make any difference on the whole scene. Uh the the Germans were so uh powerful whether we would have _ a little better together or not, wouldn't have made 61 any difference. The Joint is another chapter. The Joint gave instructions not to cooperate with . Had instructions from the Joint in in , New York, not to cooperate with us which was due to the uh competition between the World Jewish Congress in the United States which pursued rescue activities on its own and based on the collections in South America and the Joint. My criticism with regard to the Joint is very clear. Until very late they did not see that this was not just a general welfare undertaking which was necessary but a special political rescue action. This they understood very ...and rescue and philotropic (ph) welfare is quite a different thing. The Joint even opposed Martin Goldman's proposal to the...Goldman was a man who had great ideas and great schemes. He had..in the war, during the war, two great ideas. The one was to approach the Allies and to take...to ask them to ask them that the Allies should offer to the German government to take the totality of Jews into the Allied camp, and to evacuate and the other camp would care for them. This, of course, was a revolutionary idea. It was probably the only great idea uh that could be conceived, but it was immediately rejected by the British . The other idea was the constructive idea of a basic joint effort to rescue, and he proposed five...a fund of five million dollars of contribution from America, five million dollars contribution from uh United...from uh Britain and two million from the Jews. This was sabotaged by the Jews. The Joint was against it. The Joint was believing that they had a kind of monopoly on Jewish defense and and and Jewish welfare activities,. 1 62 and the government shouldn't interfere. It was an absolute basic mistake. When the war was over, our greatest asset was that we we succeeded in in convincing the Allied governments, the UN, to participate and take the responsibility for the surviving refugees. The was based was based and financed by the governments, not by the Jewish organization. The UNDRA effort was based and here the World Jewish Congress had an important role in in uh introducing this idea and this concept. The the fact that hundreds of thousands of people were in need was not the responsibility of private people. It was the responsibility of the uh world community, which had not conducted world affairs in the way which could have saved these people, and so uh both in number and both in the uh international refugee organization after the war, the responsibility of governments and the financial responsibility of the basic needs was recognized and we should have done it, of course, during the World uh World War II, but the the Jewish were not yet right for such a concept. Today it is absolutely obvious that private organizations, private citizens, can only contribute to it, but the the basic needs and the basic policies have to be financed by governments and international intergovernmental organizations in order to keep the basic needs covered. ..
