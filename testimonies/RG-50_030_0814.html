My mother was strict with us. So — and then, my poor mother, because nobody bought from us, she sold them so we made money. We worked for the farmers, picking up potatoes when it came in September, October.

  <p id="369">
   A: And we — we did all that. And I remember that’s ahead of time when my — my sister was 14, and she could go out to work, sh-she couldn’t. Why didn’t she could? Because, when she would go out to work, they would have right — right away to take her to work camp. See, at that time, we didn’t know there is such a thing as concentration camp. I didn’t know when they took me fath — they said work camp. And there were no fathers home from the — from the German people, nobo — no father was home.

Then we only said — but really didn’t — and I tell you the truth, I didn’t know til the end of the war there was such a thing as concentration camp. Even I — when they took my father to Theresienstadt, 1942” Forty-two, yeah, when my sister was born, he was already no more home. Forty-two somewhere, it’s in the papers, we have it.

  </p>
  <p id="476">

  </p>
  <p id="477">

   Q: I see. But you didn’t go to the town and —
  </p>
  <p id="481">

See, that was our thing what comes later, when the war broke out then, they brought forced labor in from the Ukraine, from Poland, from Holland, and they’re working there by the farmers, and — and in the factories. I don’t even know what there th — and when that — and prisoners of war, they brought that. You know, very deep Germany, and there went, by themself, to the farmers, the workplace, and in the nighttime they wentMay 18, 2015 back in the barracks where they slept. And that’s how they kept us.

  <p id="483">
   A: That’s why we s — 1n that little town we stayed. I never went, all that time, to Wolkenstein no more, after that, or whatever. We went to Schreiersgriin, and Treuen, and little town what we — that’s — that’s all. We didn’t —

  </p>
  <p id="513">

The Hartzfelds(ph), the Korodovskis(ph), or — and they all had fur business, and — and other — they all business people. You know, the German Jews in — at that time, and down there, they were not poor.
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: So how come she could take them out, and wasn’t able to take you and your parents out?
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: Because she still was mad that he married a Gentile woman. And when she gave him — forgave him, she came down to Schreiersgriin before she left, and she begged my mother’s forgiveness.

  <p id="516">
   Q: Did she?

But I says, I remember exactly, how my fa — it was around the Christmastime, how he came back. I don’t know, I spilled vinegar or whatever, when he walked in the door. And — and his brother came home, too, that Harry. And he said at the time, because he always came, he loved my mother, this brother. So he says, the Germans never going to get me again. So, his wife did not stay with him. She had two brothers who were in the SS. So he May 18, 2015 could not live with her, so he went to live in Berlin. And then they had this — to wear this yellow star, my father and his brother.

That what — was German was about. That’s why I says, when they said — when they mate with us, oh, the Jews — said we were yekkes, and the Jews said we were Germans. I said, my mother was more a Jew than you ever will be, because She had a choice, and she lived to be a Jew. She had a choice, and she was a beautiful 42 years, and she’s buried in the Jewish cemetery, next to my father. So, nobody can look down on us.

But I don’t — I went one time back to Germany, one time, ’95. And I didn’t want to, I had for my cousin there, and he always come to us, to — to — to America, visit us. And he always says, why don’t you come? He still lives in the house I am born in. He’s a builder, and they made it modernized and everything. And I se — I always says, I didn’t forget nothing there, and I didn’t lose nothing there. So, one time I went back, and that’s it. And my mother one time, and she says, I’m never going back there.

  </p>
  <p id="845">
   A: Oh. But I really didn’t see them much after the war, because we moved up to that Wolkenstein. We lived — we lived in that small town, and my grandmother and they all lived in Treuen mostly. And then when you had the — had transportation to go, you know, it was a long — like two hours, to go to that Treuen, to Wolkenstein. And the — after the war was not much transportation. And then, you had to have a special pass to go on a bus. Even after the war, you know, was nothing that as — was the Russian zone, they traded us — we got liberated from the American, and that’s when they found the papers, we were ready for transport.

   A: — sectors. [indecipherable] got traded in for Berlin. So suddenly, overnight, the Russian came to our town. And my parents were not home, we children — and we were young girls, and they still raped and did different things. So we had to choose [indecipherable] and my — my sister — I was 13, and my sister was already 15, 16, you know how —
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   Q: A dangerous age.
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: Yeah, so sh — we took that Jewish star, and we hide it when they come in, that they didn’t do it, because they went from house to house to look. That they didn’t bother us, we were home by then, safe.
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   Q: So soldier — Russian soldiers tried — Soviet soldiers tried to come into your house, too?

  </p>
  <p id="870">
   Q: — so that your mother would speak up for them, and that the town would not be traded for Berlin. Is this right? I don’t understand the connection of being traded.
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: That has nothing to do with it.
  </p>
  <p id="872">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   A: Th-th-th — Berlin, in trading us [indecipherable] of it, that has nothing to do with us.

  <p id="876">
   Q: Americans.
  </p>
  <p id="877">
   A: — from the American, but later we got occupation from the Russian, because th- the American wanted a part of — of Berlin, the English wanted, and the French, and the Russian. So they divided Germany, and we became East Germany. You know that.May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="878">
   Q: Yes, but people will not know it, necessarily —
  </p>
  <p id="879">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="880">
   Q: — who are listening to the interview.
  </p>
  <p id="881">
   A: That — that became East Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="882">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="883">
   A: But originally, we were liberated.
  </p>
  <p id="884">
   Q: Okay. So, let’s go back a little bit, and talk about how did your father get back home?
  </p>
  <p id="885">
   A: He got liberated in Theresienstadt, and he came home again.
  </p>
  <p id="886">

   A: What do I know?
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="889">
   A: I don’t know — I don’t know. There was su-such turmoil after the war, I don’t know, but suddenly he was home again.
  </p>
  <p id="890">
   Q: And was he different than he had been before?
  </p>
  <p id="891">
   A: Older. Little wiser. He right away went and — went, and he went up to that Wolkenstein [indecipherable] I knew, and he took back, he had the people throwing out what his parents lived in there, in the house. I have pictures of that. And then, after few weeks, we moved up there to Wolkenstein, we took over theMay 18, 2015 quarters, he took over the business. My father was a big man at that time. He was only Jew — like, in Wolkenstein then, like a few of them came back. But they ar — later went away again.
  </p>
  <p id="892">
   Q: So, when he came back, his mother’s business, which had been taken away by the — the Nazis.

  </p>
  <p id="895">
   A: It wasn’t a house, was apartment, right above the store.
  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: It was an apartment above the store.
  </p>
  <p id="897">
   A: Yeah.

   Q: People had moved in there.
  </p>
  <p id="899">

  </p>
  <p id="905">
   A: That was my grandmother’s home, and that’s where my father was born.May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="906">
   Q: So, what did that place look like, that apartment quarter? You know, tell me a little —
  </p>
  <p id="907">

But that was not big enough, too. And then later when — across the street, a bigger one — then I was already married — we moo — they moved over there.
  </p>
  <p id="912">
   Q: So in other words, your parents were able to move into this family’s home.
  </p>
  <p id="913">
   A: Yeah, and take the business back.
  </p>
  <p id="914">
   Q: That’s many ironies there, you know, it’s very ironic.
  </p>
  <p id="915">

  </p>
  <p id="1605">
   A: Over the — yeah, yeah, on that side.
  </p>
  <p id="1606">
   Q: Okay, okay. All right, and do you think it is — where it says Haushaltwaren, this sign is probably covering up what it said, Augusta Levy before?
  </p>
  <p id="1607">
   A: Yeah, probably. 133 May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1608">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1609">
   A: It’s now an — it says now, they told me, my — my sister, I think, told me, it’s now on there that they made it like a remembrance, that there used to be Jewish people. Because they told me it’s still there, Augusta Levy.
  </p>
  <p id="1610">
   Q: I see. Okay. [break] So, we’ve — earlier we spoke about your life, about the complications that came with being from a mixed marriage. About the extraordinary strength, as well as youth, that your parents had, to endure everything. I’d like to ask you now, 1s there something you would want your grandchildren to know, and other people’s grandchildren to know, about that time that you lived through.
  </p>
  <p id="1611">
   A: I would like them to know that they would never go through their life, what we went through. And sh-should respect people for their beliefs, and what they are. They [indecipherable] everybody for that. Because life is hard enough without all the complication.
  </p>
  <p id="1612">
   Q: Now the — you know, you mentioned through your story, something that I find very unique, which — unique in the degree of loyalty that your parents had one — to one another, when all the pressures were on them, particularly on your mother, to renounce your father. What would you want of the values that they passed onto you, that your children and grandchildren would also know about?
  </p>
  <p id="1613">
   A: First of all, I was very against mixed marriages. 134 May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1614">
   Q: You were?
  </p>
  <p id="1615">
   A: Oh yeah. It’s very hard, not on the two people who got married, it’s for the children. They don’t belong. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for them. But now we live in a new world, and I hope it never gonna happen again, because everybody’s bleeding the same way.
  </p>
  <p id="1616">
   Q: Well, that’s true. That’s true. Is there something in your story, and in your life, that you would like to share, that you forgot to tell us about?
  </p>
  <p id="1617">
   A: ’'m not even think of it, what I can te —
  </p>
  <p id="1618">
   Q: That you think is important for us to know.
  </p>
  <p id="1619">
   A: I know it, but I would — I can’t think of it. I don’t know. It’s — I think my childhood, I — I could think it’s — was hard, but still, I like to remember it, because we all had each other, and we worked for the common goal, and we were very loyal to each other, what it’s very important. And especially, I give my mother the greatest respect, because she did not have to suffer like anybody, because she had a choice. But she did it, and my father and mother, happy. And she stayed a widow for 42 years. That’s how loyal she was to her father, even she was not accepted from the beginning, by her in-laws. And I admire that so much. I admire that loyalty, and I think we have it as such, most of our children, or her children, have all that loyalty. 135 May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1620">
   Q: So that’s something that she modeled for them, and showed for them, and they took as a —
  </p>
  <p id="1621">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1622">
   Q: — their own value.
  </p>
  <p id="1623">
   A: Yeah, my — my — my one sister is married 60 years. My other one was married in the 40 years, because her husband passed away. Now, my brother is married over 50 years. My other brother just lost his wife, and my other brother married very late, he has a young wife. His children is only as old as my children. But that’s my youngest brother, so we all have that value that marriage is very important, and loyalty that we learned from my mother, and my father.
  </p>
  <p id="1624">
   Q: Of your siblings, your brothers and sisters —
  </p>
  <p id="1625">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1626">
   Q: — did you talk amongst one another after the war, about everything that you had gone through, about your unusual family, that you came from a mixed marriage, and so on?
  </p>
  <p id="1627">
   A: We - we didn’t talk as much, but we just say it is so very hard, how you grow up in that, and suddenly you live this way. Because we choose the Jewish way of life. And — but still, we cannot forget that we lived in a Christian world. It’s something — 136 May 18, 2015 so when some holidays come around, you think about it. But, the celebration, it comes right down, we are Jewish. And our kids are je — always Jewish.
  </p>
  <p id="1628">
   Q: And that’s for all the siblings?
  </p>
  <p id="1629">
   A: Wait a minute. No, the one doesn’t keep [indecipherable] but all of them, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1630">
   Q: That’s quite a lot, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1631">
   A: Yeah, my — my sister here, this one, she couldn’t [indecipherable] she — like I told you, she even went to the mikveh. My — my sister too, my one sister, she married in Fervenwald(ph), Liezowski(ph) married them, and she went to the mikveh. What I — because I was in the — in the Russian zone, you know —
  </p>
  <p id="1632">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1633">
   A: — there was not such a thing. But my sister, and — and my older sister, too, what passed away, and which one comes then, and then [indecipherable] and my sister, the one ya — younger sister, she married twice. She had kids, and then she married a da — a doctor, and — and she’s a widow a long time, and she’s so young, and she’s not healthy. Really not. But otherwise, we all doing pretty good.
  </p>
  <p id="1634">
   Q: And do the — does the younger generation — it clearly sounds that, from your family, that is, your husband and yourself, your children are interested in your stories. https://collections.ushmm.org 137May 18, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1635">
   A: Oh yes, my — my children know. My — matter of fact, my one grandson took me my tape away, and he lives in New York, and he says, Grandma, could I have it? But Grandma never saw it again. So I let him have it. I says, what do I want to — I don’t know. So yes, and there are — and like I gave you the paper, the one is like [indecipherable] she’s very active, and then the one went to Israel, and he wanted to stay there, but his father was — they’re all very — and — and here, the little one has. They’re all very interested in it. They’re — we instilled that life, and they’re not that religious, but they know they are Jewish, and where they come from. And they’ ll know from their grandmother, from Oma, what was, and Oma choosed the life.
