  <p id="113">
   A: He — he was very wise. He was very smart when it came — as a matter of fact, later, when he was a businessman, he made some very, very smart moves, and we were, because of that, we were pretty well-to-do.

So remember, it is your responsibility.

  <p id="380">

   A: We - my father, he used to travel a lot. And first of all, they had conventions of the — the soldiers’ conventions, spre — specially from the legion of — Marshall Pilsudski’s legion. So he used to — every year he used to have a convention that he January 25, 2015 used to travel. Sometime he would take my mother, then my grandmother was in charge of our brood. So my father did — I was my — like I said, my older sister did travel some se — west — western part of Poland, but I did not. I— maybe 50 — hundred kilometers from Nowogrodek, yes.

  <p id="397">
   A: That’s pretty close, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="398">
   Q: And what were some of the things that you were hearing about from Germany, that people talked about, and then we’ talk about the people who escaped from Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="399">
   A: Well, Germany at that time already, were — of course there were pretty strong nations, pretty stor — strong country. And they were already trying to get some of the territory that belong and was given to Poland in peace talks after first World War, which separated Germany from east Prussia, they — but also gave Poland access to Baltic Sea —

   Q: Sot

  <p id="401">
   A: — which was a very important terri — territory to Poland, but Germans wanted that part for them, so they have — so they’II be connected to east Prussia. And Germany was threatening Poland with the aggression and — and I remember hearing about — about it in my parents’ discussions, my parents’ friends’ January 25, 2015 discussions, that the r1 — the Germans were threatening all the time to — marching to that part of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="402">

  <p id="416">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="417">
   A: Which was a — quite a big — big territory, which was ruled by Germans, and they wanted to connect it to the main German territory, and this piece of land separated — separated east Prussia from main Germany, but it gave Poland access to the Baltic Sea, which is very important for the modern nation to be able to exist from the country to the rest of the world.
  </p>
  <p id="418">
   Q: To have a coastline, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="419">
   A: That’s right. Well, the — the trades — the — the shipping is very important for the well-being of the nation.
  </p>
  <p id="420">
   Q: Mm-hm. And as a result of World War One’s outcome, it had been land that was then —
  </p>
  <p id="421">

  </p>
  <p id="436">
   Q: Okay.

  </p>
  <p id="438">
   Q: Did news of Kristallnacht reach Poland?

   A: But not from the — my childhood.
  </p>
  <p id="444">
   Q: Okay, okay. Because I wonder how the Jewish population in Nowogrédek was responding and talking about this. You might not know about that if you weren’t in — you know, didn’t have that many contacts.
  </p>
  <p id="445">
   A: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="446">
   Q: Yeah. All right, let’s turn now eastwards. You say that, you know, being so close to the Soviet border, there were people who would try to escape, and sometimes succeeded. What was the kind of news that they brought with them, about what was going on in the Soviet Union?
  </p>
  <p id="447">
   A: Well, I — I have a very well — very good information when it comes to that, because as a matter of fact, one of the men that worked for my parents escaped fr- from communist Russia through the borders and he worked for us.

   Q: What was his name? Do you —

   A: Anthony. I don’t remember his last name, but I remember he — he was a terrific guy. He spent a lot of time playing with my brother and myself. He lived in our house and he worked for my parents. Very good man. He had experienced some tortures even, in — 1n Russia.

   Q: Okay. And what other kind of news did you hear about what was going on in the Soviet Union?
  </p>
  <p id="459">
   A: Not really much more, because they were very, very — not publicizing at that time, what was happening, and there was no contacts with any of the people. There were no contacts at all. As a matter of fact, my mother and my grandmother had very little contact with their own family in — 1n —1n Russia. January 25, 2015

  </p>
  <p id="462">
   Q: This — yeah. One of the reasons I ask this is that — is just it’s, in today’s world, when we’re talking in 2015, it sounds almost inconceivable, that with our means of information and communication, that we wouldn’t know what’s going on ina country that’s next to our own, because you find out so quickly.
  </p>
  <p id="463">
   A: Well, Russians, who had a clamp on everything, on — on — on whatever was happening, the government had a clamp on it. The propaganda came right from the main — from Moscow. There people are not allowed to listen to radio. Of — what they were reading in the papers was written by the government. There was no free speech, there was no free publicity of any that kind. So there was very little knowledge of what was happening coming out, out of Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Yeah. Were there different political parties in Nowogrodek?
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Oh yes, of course. That’s — Poles are known for it. There is — as a matter of fact, I remember saying that it-it — that if they — you have three Poles together, you have at least three different parties, political parties.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: Poles are known for that. Everybody is — has his own opinion. January 25, 2015

  <p id="468">
   Q: Did your parents have a particular bent, or a particular political point of view within Polish politics?
  </p>
  <p id="469">
   A: I guess so. Well, to m — to us, whatever Marshall Pilsudski said, that was a — that was it.

  <p id="470">

  </p>
  <p id="484">
   Q: In the late 30s, of course, as you say, there was talk of war. Do you remember what the summer of 1939 was like, what you were doing?
  </p>
  <p id="485">
   A: Well, yes, the international situation was very on the edge, very s — on the edge, as you — Germans were pressing more and more for that territory, and threatening, and Poland had a problem, because for practically 150 years, Poland as a nation, as a country in Europe did not exist. It was not on the map of Europe. It was divided into three parts. Parts of Russia, parts of Germany, parts of Austria. Those countries tr — took advantage of Poland’s production, they — they milked Poland to death, taking advantage of everything. So, from 1920 to 1939, it wasn’t even 20 years that Poland was a free country, taking care of its own. So we didn’t — we were not prepared for any kind of war. We were — Poland was building schools, road, bridges, railroads. We were not prepared for the war, and it — but war was on the — on the horizon.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: That summer, did you — were you at home, were you on — in vacation, where — what were you doing right before the war started? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="487">
   A: Well, w-wer — we — it was just over the summer holidays. S-Sc-School was started over in 1939, w-we just started to school when the war started.
  </p>
  <p id="488">
   Q: Were you in school when it started?
  </p>

   A: Well —
  </p>
  <p id="490">
   Q: Do you remember where you were?
  </p>
  <p id="491">
   A: — no, we were — we were at home. As a matter of fact, wa — was — what I remember distinctly, we had two beautiful German Shepherd dogs. They were young dogs, they’re guard dogs. And from the early morning, they were howling. They were howling, and we didn’t know what happened until we heard on the radio that Germany attacked Poland. And that wa — so, very early in the morning on the 19 —
  </p>
  <p id="492">
   Q: September first, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: Th-Th — oh — that was September, right?
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Mm-hm, September first.
  </p>
  <p id="495">
   A: First, that Germany attacked Poland. Within the next day, my father got his orders to report to the town of Zhest(ph), where there was a big Polish army unit.
  </p>
  <p id="496">
   Q: And where is Zhest(ph)?
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: Zhest(ph) was the ep — west of — west of Nowogrodek. It divides — it’s right on the river, and it’s — 1t was like a fortress in the years past, and there was a thi — January 25, 2015 that’s where my father was assigned to. He was reporting — had to report to his unit over there. I remember he li — leaving the town. We cried. I remember he went to his bedroom, and on the wall there was a picture of Holy Mary, and he cried.
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: He cried.
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: Because he had to leave his family. And I hold his — I was holding his hand, and I wa — cried with him. And he — we took him to the bus, he took a bus to Zhest(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: Hm. It’s interesting. What do you think the dogs were howling at?
  </p>
  <p id="501">
   A: I don’t know how, they had a feeling that some — some — something was happening. And I — it was scary. It was really scary.
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: What happened after that?
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: Well, lotta — lotta young people were drafted right away. They had to report to his — to their military units. And within a few days, there was a — there were a couple instances where German planes flew over Nowogrodek, but they — they didn’t drop a single bomb.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: So, did you continue going to school?
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Yes, we continued going to school. Within about 10 days, my father came back. Let’s face it, my father was in his lates — late 40s. There were, in the unit that my father was assigned to, there were a lot of young officers that were very well January 25, 2015 prepared. My father was an old man already, considered in those times. So he was put on a standby and came home, in the uniform, and —
  </p>
  <p id="506">
   Q: That must have been a relief.
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: Well, for us it was a — oh God, it was a real wonderful surprise. But it didn’t last long because on the 17" of September, Russians march into Poland. Of course, we didn’t know at that time that they — what they had the agreement with Germany, that as soon as Germany attacks Poland from the west, Russians will attack Poland from the east. Our forces were fighting as hard as they could to keep ra — Germans from marching far into Poland, but eventually they did get all the way to Warsaw, to capital. But in the meantime, Russians took over the whole eastern part of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: So, if they attacked, or marched in on September 17", they must have reached Nowogrodek within an hour.
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: They were second day. They were second day they were 1n pol — in Nowogrodek. We couldn’t — we couldn’t understand some Belarussians and Jews were greeting them. They were greeting Russian soldiers marching into Nowogrodek, and they were — the orang — Russian army was pitiful.
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: What do you mean — what do — why do you say that? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: Neglected — neglected only — the ones on the horses, the horses were — some of them were like skeletons. People were dirty in the — I could — it’s hard to explain. We had to c-compare what we were comparing to our soldiers that were really, you know, sharp looking. This was misery. But they were in power, so what can we do? And within a — one day of getting into Nowogrodek, the terror s-started. Russians, with the help of the local communists were arresting policemen, government people, any military, teachers, priests, they were arresting. Pretty soon the local jail was full of our local best — our local people. Of course —
  </p>
  <p id="512">
   Q: Did you know anybody —
  </p>
  <p id="513">
   A: Pardon?
  </p>
  <p id="514">
   Q: Do you — do you know — did you pers —
  </p>
  <p id="515">
   A: Most of — most of our friends’ fathers were in there. And of course, the second say, my father was arrested. And the I — they arrested him 1n town, but in the afternoon he came home. They — they questioned him and released him, and I remember hearing my parents whispering, talking. My mother insisted that he leaves Nowogroédek and goes over to the German side, to the town where he is from, where his family was, and my father didn’t want to go because he wa — didn’t want to leave the family alone. Well, he — he — they didn’t have to make a decision, because that night we were already in bed, some of us, some of them were going to January 25, 2015 bed. There was a — rifle butts against the doors, banging on the doors. Local Jews — Jew, with a red band just [indecipherable] that he was a — one of the commissars that became communist commissar, led three or four, I don’t remember now, Russian soldiers with the rifles with bayonets. They took my father, they put the br — put him [indecipherable] and marched him, and that was the last time we seen him.
  </p>
  <p id="516">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="517">
   A: We haven’t seen him since. For — for quite a while, it got to be known that if the jail would allow us to be — to give some food parcel or clothes parcel to the people in jail, that meant that the person was still in jail. After about two or three weeks, they stopped taking parcels. That was indication that my father was not in local jail any more. Where, or how, we don’t know. We could never, during the war, after the war, we could never find out what happened to him.
  </p>
  <p id="518">
   Q: Did you know —
  </p>
  <p id="519">
   A: And du — du — his main sin was that he was active in a community life, that he fought at least Russians in 1920. Russians and Germans practiced the same thing. If you eliminate leaders of the community, it’s going to be that much easier to run the community. Well, that was my father’s problem. He was active of the — in his community life, so they had to get rid of him. January 25, 2015

   A: And — and — but it turn out there were a lot of Jews in Poland that were communists, and there were some — there were some [indecipherable] people that were communists. And they, of course, right away worked for Russians, worked for communists.

On top of it, within a couple weeks of arresting my father, Russians authorities came, lived on the edge of the town — and like I said, we had a big house, we had a big barn, they wanted our property, because they wanted to — for Russian people to take to live in there. My mother insisted that we will move if they give us a house to move in. And that’s why we did — we were not very surprised when on the 10" of February, 1940, again a Russian officer with a — some soldiers, at night — they always done all those arresting and deporting at night. They — it was the middle of the winter, cold, about a foot or so of snow. They marched to our house and told us to get ready, pick — get ready, pick up whatever you can carry, because you’re getting deported.
  </p>
  <p id="538">
   Q: Was this the same house, or had you moved?
  </p>
  <p id="539">
   A: No, it’s the same house. But we were — we were thought that we were being deported from our house to the other house. We were — we went — we didn’t know we were being deported to Russia, to Siberia. So 1t was quite a shock.
  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: Oh my. Let’s talk a little bit about the months in between. Did you ever go to the prison where your father was, to bring food?
  </p>
  <p id="541">
   A: My mother used to.
  </p>
  <p id="542">
   Q: Okay. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: My mother used to, at least few times a week. Sh —
  </p>
  <p id="544">
   Q: Had you ever been to this place?
  </p>
  <p id="545">
   A: Jail?
  </p>
  <p id="546">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="547">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="548">
   Q: So you didn’t know what it looked like?
  </p>
  <p id="549">
   A: No, no, I didn’t. I went by it.
  </p>
  <p id="550">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="551">
   A: You know, from the street, I seen the entrance to it, was big —
  </p>
  <p id="552">
   Q: Was it — was it a city jail, or something?
  </p>
  <p id="553">
   A: It was a city jail, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="554">
   Q: And how long was it that your father was held there, you think?
  </p>
  <p id="555">
   A: Well, we’re — as a matter of fact, we were pretty sure that, although they were not taking parcels to him, that he was still there, because there was my sister’s friend, my gir — her girlfriend, when she wasn’t a — she wasn’t deported, so she was there, and she, after the war, she told us that she saw my father about a month — month or so after we were deported, he was being led to the railroad by — with a group of other prisoners, and she knew my father well. And, as a matter of fact, supposedly my father asked her, cause when he spotted her, where are we? What January 25, 2015 happened to his family. And of course she said that she told him that we were already deported to Russia. And that’s what happened. After the war she told us. That’s when she told us.
  </p>
  <p id="556">
   Q: Let’s — let’s talk about this a little bit more. You say you never found out what happened to your father. That is, in — where — what his destiny was, where he was taken, or anything. Is that — that so?
  </p>
  <p id="557">
   A: That’s correct, yes. We tried, through Red Cross, we — all kinds of institutions that had lists of — of our people that were murdered, in Katyn forest, in other areas. We — n-none of those lists have my father’s name.
  </p>
  <p id="558">
   Q: So this —
  </p>
  <p id="559">
   A: But then, of course, they were — lot of our people, lot of men and women were murdered in the small towns and buried right there, close to it. And some cemeteries were never found out, never opened, never found out where, who was.
  </p>
  <p id="560">
   Q: Yeah. And did you ever go back to Nowogrodek after the war?
  </p>
  <p id="561">
   A: I did not. My brother and my sister did. As a matter of fact, they went to there, to our house, our —
  </p>
  <p id="562">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="563">
   A: — original house. And people were afraid. They thought that they were coming to take over, because there were people living there. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="564">
   Q: Yeah. What years did they go, or what year did they go there?
  </p>
  <p id="565">
   A: Oh, this must be about — at least 10 years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="566">
   Q: So would be like 2005?
  </p>
  <p id="567">
   A: Yeah, something like that, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="568">
   Q: Yeah, so would have been, oh man, 65 years after —
  </p>
  <p id="569">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="570">
   Q: — afterwards.
  </p>
  <p id="571">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="572">
   Q: And in 2005 if they were there, then it was Belarus.
  </p>
  <p id="573">
   A: Belarus, yes. They flew from Warsaw to Linz, and then they took a — I think a car, and drove to Nowogrodek.
  </p>
  <p id="574">
   Q: And was it feasible, or was it already, you know, no ho — no hope that there might be some information in the municipal records about your father?
  </p>
  <p id="575">
   A: Nothing, nothing, nothing could be found.
  </p>
  <p id="576">
   Q: They looked? Or they tried?
  </p>
  <p id="577">
   A: They — they s — they tried, yes. Nothing could be found of what happened to my father, which 1s so painful that we still don’t know what happened to him.
  </p>
  <p id="578">
   Q: About — did — was there ever any story about, or any research done on any of the prisoners, or of the — the fact that they were held in this city jail for — you know, the January 25, 2015 ja—as you Said, the jails filled up so quickly after the Soviets marched in, and what happened to most of the people there.
  </p>
  <p id="579">
   A: Well, si— you see, the Russians, probably some of the lists of people that they were arrested, and some of the people that they murdered, it j — it just happens that Belarussians do also have lists of people that they arrested. They were arrested in that territory.
  </p>
  <p id="580">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="581">
   A: And th-they were — for some stupid reason, they will not release that list. So there is possibility that my father could be on that list, but th-th — the — the existing government of Belarus will not — not release that list.
  </p>
  <p id="582">
   Q: Won’t — so that’s — that’s — yeah, I understand. I understand. Before we go to that night where you thought you were being taken to your second home in — or another house, and it turned out not to be the case, tell me a little bit about those months in between, about October, November, December. How did life progress? What was going on with your mother, your — your businesses?
  </p>
  <p id="583">
   Q: Well, well, the business they took over right away. Within a week they took over the business, and my mother worked for them. She had to work for them, and so it wasn’t our business any more. As far as the life, right away there were shortages of just about everything. Even the — such a thing as salt, y-you had to queue — line up January 25, 2015 for hours sometime to get some salt. Sugar was hardly ever in the stores. Meat. The only thing that we could get pretty easy was bread, but otherwise, there were shortages of everything.
  </p>
  <p id="584">
   Q: How do you explain that?
  </p>
  <p id="585">
   A: Well, Russians were exporting — taking everything into Russia. There were trains being loaded and taken into the deep Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="586">
   Q: And of course, supply lines were — were cut.
  </p>
  <p id="587">
   A: Acor — of course. So — and of course the — the life was miserable. Everybody — the fear — this 1s the way they run the country, fear. One person against the other. And they, right away that — did that fear took over the whole town. People were afraid, they were li — would — before they would say anything, they would look around if there was anybody listening. Because all you had to do was say something about that you were not pleased what was happening, you can wind up in jail right away.
  </p>
  <p id="588">
   Q: Did this extend to school, as well?
  </p>
  <p id="589">
   A: Well, of course, the teachers were our old teachers, but at least once a week we would have to have special classes, where they would try to convince us of what a wonderful country, what a free country Russia is, how — how advanced, how — of course, we knew better, even though we were children. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="590">
   Q: So, what — what happened to that gentleman, you said his name was Alex, or Alexi, who was working with you — working for your father?
  </p>
  <p id="591">
   A: Well, he — he left us. As soon as Russians came in, he left. He ma — he was there maybe a couple days and he left. I don’t know what — what happened. Maybe he was afraid that they would put him in jail, too, because he escaped from there. But h-he left and ru — I don’t recall ever seeing him, or hearing of him again.
  </p>
  <p id="592">
   Q: Okay. Now Id like to — I’d like to broach a subject that is a — a painful one, and a very sensitive one, but you — you mentioned that it was a local Jewish communist who came in when — when they arrested your father, and took him away. How — how did people — did people say, uh-huh, the Jews have betrayed us? Was that a sentiment?
  </p>
  <p id="593">
   A: Exactly. That was the feeling. That was — there were — I wouldn’t say they were all — all of them were communists, but there was quite a few of them, and the ones that did it, right away took — took over some th — important position in local government. They — they — quite a few of them.
  </p>
  <p id="594">
   Q: And —
  </p>
  <p id="595">
   A: But not all of them.
  </p>
  <p id="596">
   Q: Were there any people who, let’s say were Jewish and well-to-do, who were also arrested? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="597">
   A: Not — no — not that I know of.
  </p>
  <p id="598">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="599">
   A: At that time, I di — did not — not that — not that I know of. Could be — could be —
  </p>
  <p id="600">
   Q: Or deported, for example?
  </p>
  <p id="601">
   A: Not at that time. Later on I was told that they were, later on, just before Germany attacked Russia, there were some Russians — some jer — Jews were arrested and deported into the deep Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="602">
   Q: Before the war, how were relations — I mean, many Jewish people say that Poles are very anti-Semitic, or that anti-Semitism was rampant in Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="603">
   A: Well, a lot of it 1s true, a lot of it is true. But, at the same time, if you know the real life in all the European countries, Poland was pretty free [indecipherable] as far as the religion is concerned.
  </p>
  <p id="604">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="605">
   A: So, whoever — whatever religion you were, you were free to practice it. Before, in the first — 30s, where Nazis took over Germany, they deported a lot of Jews to Poland, or a lot of Jews came into Poland for escape from Germany to Poland, and they were doing pretty good. But you have to realize that most of the industry, most of the business in Poland was in Jews’ hands. Jew — Jews had a saying that was very popular, you have the streets, but we have the buildings on them. Which January 25, 2015 meant that they — they were in control of quite a bit of industry, quite a bit of — bit of business. Now, there — they were known for being bankers, for — for doing lot of trading and that. And sorry to say, but our average people don’t like rich, rich people. And they were — they represented the rich people. So lot of common people were, of course, hateful of them. Wa — but we didn’t have any — with Russians were doing those pogroms and that, we de — we didn’t have anything like that. But fact was, we didn’t like them, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="606">
   Q: Were there any Jewish kids in your classes at school?
  </p>
  <p id="607">
   A: Of course, of course. But there were some good Jews, and I have an example. I was going to tell you that later. I will tell you later.
  </p>
  <p id="608">
   Q: Okay, okay. I know that this is a very —
  </p>
  <p id="609">
   A: Touchy [indecipherable] subject.
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   Q: — touchy — touchy sensi — it’s very sensitive subject, but in — particularly in the areas of the kressi(ph), where there were so many different occupations and occupations by — by different forces, armies and — and so on. It was one of the reasons why I was asking you too, wha-what was the make-up of the towns, and the people, and so on. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   A: Well, yes, like the — in Nowogroédek there was a — quite a good sized population of Jews, but then there was also Belarussian and the Poles. It was pretty — I would say it was evenly divided.
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   Q: Okay. Well, we’ll break for lunch right now.
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   A: Oh.
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   Q: And come back and talk later —
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   A: Good.
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   Q: — for — and take the story forward when —
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   A: Good.
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   Q: — after you’re arrested. Thank you.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   A: Good, good. I’Il be here. End of File One January 25, 2015 Beginning File Two
  </p>
  <p id="620">
   Q: Okay, so Mr. Szymel, we s — what we see here is a photograph. Tell me who is in the photograph?
  </p>
  <p id="621">
   A: They’re my family. My father, my mother, my grandmother, my older sister and me when I was one year old, practically one year old.
  </p>
  <p id="622">
   Q: So that means it was taken in 1928.
  </p>
  <p id="623">
   A: ‘29.
  </p>
  <p id="624">
   Q: Oh, 1929.
  </p>
  <p id="625">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   Q: And how is it that you came to have this photograph?
  </p>
  <p id="627">
   A: My parents send it to our relatives in Poland at that time, and when we were visiting them after the war, we found it and they made a copy of it, and they — here itis. To me, it’s a relic. It’s — 1t’s something that I cherish, because that’s the only picture of our childhood with our — babyhood, not just childhood.
  </p>
  <p id="628">
   Q: Is it the only photo you have of your father?
  </p>
  <p id="629">
   A: No, I have some others.
  </p>
  <p id="630">
   Q: You have some others.
  </p>
  <p id="631">
   A: Yes. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="632">
   Q: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, we can put it to the side now. Okay, before the break, we kind of stopped at the point where in February 10", 1940, soldiers came to your home again and in the middle of the night, knocked on the door and told you you are going to have to leave. Can you remember how long you had to put your things together?
  </p>
  <p id="633">
   A: They gave us about a half an hour, they told us that we have half an hour to pack whatever we can carry. And of course, I was — we were being deported from our house. And — now this is the middle of the severe Polish kind of winter, about 25 degrees below zero, but at least a foot of snow on the ground. And middle of the night, we — my grandmother and my brother and my sister, were put on this sled, horse-drawn sled and my mother, my older sister and me, we walked. We walked, and we were taken to the government building, not far from railroad station, and the building was pretty soon being filled up with a family li — just like ours. All the people from Nowogrdédek, most of them women and children, because most of the men were either in jail, or — or gone somewhere. So, this is — this 1s the first day, first night of our experience, when they were being de — we were being deported to Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="634">
   Q: What did you manage to take with you? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="635">
   A: Well, most of we — what we tried, was we took clothing, some clothes, because of the fact that it was so cold, winter, and with that, there was hardly anything we could carry. There were a few things that were put on the sled, but otherwise we had to carry everything. So most of 1t we — we took with us was clothes.
  </p>
  <p id="636">
   Q: Okay. I-In that government building, you said there were families like your own. Did you recognize any of them?
  </p>
  <p id="637">
   A: Of course, most of them were friends of our parents, and of us children. And so we knew just about — at least 90 percent of people, they were either acquaintances, or friends of ours.
  </p>
  <p id="638">
   Q: Then what happened?
  </p>
  <p id="639">
   A: The next morning — the next morning they packed us — they told us we have to march to the railroad station. When we got there, there was a whole line of freight cars that were prepared for transporting mass people. The way it was built, on each end of the — the freight car, there were shelves, two shelves on each end, where they packed us, about 40 people to each car, which meant that we were to lay down like sardines, you know, one — you know, next to each other, on the mi — in the middle of the — th-the wa — the wagon, there was a coal — there was a cast iron stove, to provide heat. And then on the side there was a hole in the floor of the car, as a — to serve as a toilet. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="640">
   Q: And that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="641">
   A: And that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   Q: Were there — was there anybody who didn’t have — who didn’t fit on those two platforms, who was in the middle of the car?
  </p>
  <p id="643">
   A: No, they were — they were — they were just managed.
  </p>
  <p id="644">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="645">
   A: We just managed to be either sitting down, or laying down on those platforms. On this — on the top sides on each side there were small windows, with the crates — with the crates so, you know, nobody could get out.
  </p>
  <p id="646">
   Q: With grates, mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="647">
   A: And the — of course, the whole train was surrounded by Russian soldiers with rifles, so there was no way to get in or get on of the train. We were totally captive.
  </p>
  <p id="648">
   Q: Did anybody at any point official, tell you why you had been arrested, or where you were going?
  </p>
  <p id="649">
   A: Not — not at all, not at all. Nothing, nothing there — there — they wouldn’t ask us, they wouldn’t tell us, they were just giving us orders, do this, do that.
  </p>
  <p id="650">
   Q: And the orders were, I take it, in Russian, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="651">
   A: Of course, ti — only Russian.
  </p>
  <p id="652">
   Q: Could — could you understand what they were saying? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="653">
   A: Well, most of it, but 1f not, my mother would translate it to us.
  </p>
  <p id="654">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="655">
   A: There were a lot of people that did not understand Russian, but like I say, lucky there were a few people that would translate it.
  </p>
  <p id="656">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="657">
   A: There were no Polish, or Jewish, or Belarussian civilians involved in this. This was strictly Russian soldiers that were guards.
  </p>
  <p id="658">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="659">
   A: And tha — and that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="660">
   Q: Okay. Did that little — what place did you have? Di— were you in a bottom platform, or a top platform?
  </p>
  <p id="661">
   A: No, we were on the very top, on the — on the — on the second level.
  </p>
  <p id="662">
   Q: And were you able to see out a window, or —
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   A: Yes, we — we would — we would, you know, if we — if you were next to the side of the — the wagon, or the car, then you could lock out — look out.
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   Q: And was the win — did the window have glass, or not?
  </p>
  <p id="665">
   A: Yes —
  </p>
  <p id="666">
   Q: It did. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="667">
   A: — it had glass. It was so cold, and with some of the moisture in the air from breathing, all the metal parts eventually were covered with a — ice.
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: So that’s how cold it was.
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   Q: So that stove didn’t do much good.
  </p>
  <p id="671">
   A: Well, if you were next to it, yes. So we — we had everything that we brought with us, we — were dressed in it. Later, when the doors were closed completely, it wi — it did warm up to the extent that we could take some of the clothes off.
  </p>
  <p id="672">
   Q: Did you have any food with you?
  </p>
  <p id="673">
   A: We brought si — very little, very little, but we did bring some.
  </p>
  <p id="674">
   Q: Were you fed on the train?
  </p>
  <p id="675">
   A: On the train, once a day, sometime even twice they would bring a bucket of hot water, and a bucket of what they called soup — that’s what they called it, 1t was a — loo-looked like a dishwasher water, and a loaf — couple loaves of bread for the 40 people. That was it.
  </p>
  <p id="676">
   Q: Oh my. And — and then, when did the train start moving?
  </p>
  <p id="677">
   A: Very next day. Very next day you started moving through the — we-went through the — Baranowice, which was a big railroad center first. It was close to Russian January 25, 2015 border. And then next day we crossed the — the border between Russia and Poland, all border.
  </p>
  <p id="678">
   Q: How did you know when you got to the border that you were crossing 1t?
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   A: Well, we would — we would read the signs. We could read the signs only — also, we would see the miserable view of people. People were dressed in a shabby clothes, in a padded — women and men in the same, with the padded pants and coats, miserable looking people, moving around like robots. And we — you could tell that it was not Poland any more.
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   Q: Did — did you have a sense of what your final destination would be?
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   A: Well, by that time they did ha — it did come — I don’t know how it — it was told us that — we were told we’re being deported to Siberia, but where Siberia, we didn’t have the slightest idea.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: Mm-hm. Did people get sick on the train journey?
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: Well, not so much physically, but emotionally. There was a lot of crying. There was lot of — most of it was, I would say crying and sobbing from all the mothers that were there with all the small children. It was — the feeling was terrible, terrible.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: Did you know the other people who were 1n your wagon?
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: Ninety percent of them we knew.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   Q: Okay, so in this wagon you weren’t — you weren’t with strangers, you were — January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="687">
   A: No, no, they were — they were — they were — most of them were at least acquaintances. Not friends, but acquaintances.
  </p>
  <p id="688">
   Q: Yeah. What kind — was there any conversation going on?
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   A: Oh, all the time, all the time. Comparing notes, com — talking about parts of — people of the families that were not with us, like, you know [indecipherable] my father, that were arrested, and some other men that were arrested. There were — there was a lot of talk about it, between the women, especially.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   Q: Were there any men on the — on the — in your wagon?
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   A: There might have been, out of 40, there must have been about two men, maybe. Most of them were older men.
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: Mm-hm. So that does present a very sad picture.
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: Very sad, very sad.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: Did — did — so, but did everybody make it, that is, to the final destination?
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: Well, everybody made it. Our — we were gone from Poland, we were moving straight east for about a week.
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="697">
   A: You have to realize that we were not a priority, so the train sometime would stop for the longest time on the sidings, and then we’d continue going. And eventually January 25, 2015 we atrived in Moscow. The reason we knew, because we could see the signs, Moscow on the — on — in the station.
  </p>
  <p id="698">
   Q: Did you see anything of the city?
  </p>
  <p id="699">
   A: No, absolutely not.
  </p>
  <p id="700">
   Q: Through the — through the wi — little window? No?
  </p>
  <p id="701">
   A: No, absolutely nothing. Especially it was winter, everything was covered in snow, and f-from that time on, from Moscow our destination changed. We were moving straight north.
  </p>
  <p id="702">
   Q: Oh, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="703">
   A: Before we were going east, now we were going straight north.
  </p>
  <p id="704">
   Q: And how could you tell?
  </p>
  <p id="705">
   A: Well, we could tell by sun, by — most of it sun, you know, that’s we — we changed the direction. And of course the — the — the countryside that we would see through those windows was changing gradually too. There were more snow, more — it was getting colder, and there were more and more forests. And we traveled another two — after Moscow, we traveled another two weeks, directly north.
  </p>
  <p id="706">
   Q: Oh wow. So, it took a long time actually.
  </p>
  <p id="707">
   A: Totally it took us three weeks on the train. By the time we got to our destination, which we didn’t know it was our destination, but the — the name of the town was January 25, 2015 Vowogda(ph), which was a big railroad center. And up there we were told to get out of the train, and they put us on a slow horse-drawn sleds. And again, the grown- ups and older children had to walk. Only the smaller and old were riding 1-1n the sled. And for three days we traveled to our final destination, staying at night, staying at the local schools. And few of them, we could see there was somebody spending nights up there before, most likely people just like us, the deportees, that they were spending nights up there. And thi —
  </p>
  <p id="708">
   Q: How wa — how was your mother holding out in all of this?
  </p>
  <p id="709">
   A: My mother was a trooper. She was so strong. She was so — how shall I put it? She — she could practically do miracles. She would, if she had the chance, she would warm up some water for us so we could drink s — warm water. She would divide pieces of bread into few pieces so every few hours we would have a few bites of bread. She was unbelievably strong.
  </p>
  <p id="710">
   Q: Did — did — did she cry during the trip?
  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: Not that I seen here. She was — she wa — she wouldn’t allow herself to see us that she cried.
  </p>
  <p id="712">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="713">
   A: She had to keep up the morale, so I never, never seen her cry.
  </p>
  <p id="714">
   Q: So — and your brothers and — and your brother and sisters? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="715">
   A: Well, we’re —
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: All four of you were deported, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: All four of us, oh my — my sister was — by this time she was practically 15. I was already 12, younger sister was 10, and the brother was eight.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: So your family was a little bit older, in the sense that there were no infants.
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: No, there were no infants, but on the — in the train, in the car, there were some small babies, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="720">
   Q: Yeah. And were you amongst those who had to walk beside the —
  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: Yes, yes —
  </p>
  <p id="722">
   Q: — the sleigh?
  </p>
  <p id="723">
   A: — yes. Each — every time, I was already 12 years old, so I was considered that I could si — take it, take care of it.
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   Q: And, were you thinking of what your father had said before?
  </p>
  <p id="725">
   A: Well, not at that time, but after that, when I grew up, many a times it came to my mind what — what he meant.
  </p>
  <p id="726">
   Q: Because at that time it sounds like your mother was taking the burdens on her shoulders.
  </p>
  <p id="727">
   A: She — totally, totally. She was in charge. She was in charge. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="728">
   Q: When you — when did you — where did you end up being your — what ended up being your final destination?
  </p>
  <p id="729">
   A: Well, on the third day we arrived what — which was a logging camp. There were about five bar — wooden, log barra — barracks, designed for the people that would work f-falling timber — logging. And —
  </p>
  <p id="730">
   Q: What was the name of this place?
  </p>
  <p id="731">
   A: The — the name was Rzhavka(ph), which took the name from the small river that flow through it. The ri — the name of the river was Rzhavka(ph), which means rusty. And the — the reason it was rusty — called rusty, because the water in it was colored of —
  </p>
  <p id="732">
   Q: Of rust?
  </p>
  <p id="733">
   A: — rust, yes. From the vegetation that it flowed, the — most of the area were marshes, and the — our camp was on the lower hill, among marshes, right in the middle of virgin forests.
  </p>
  <p id="734">
   Q: That sounds very pretty, actually.
  </p>
  <p id="735">
   A: It — 1t wasn — part of it was beautiful, not just pretty, 1t was beautiful. The nature can be that way, but it — they — also can be cruel, because of the cold, because of the terrain and whatever.
  </p>
  <p id="736">
   Q: So your — the — the — settlement that you go to is Rzhavka(ph), yeah? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="737">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="738">
   Q: And they — it’s made of — it’s comprised of five log cabins?
  </p>
  <p id="739">
   A: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="740">
   Q: So it’s a rather small place —
  </p>
  <p id="741">
   A: It’s not a cabin, it’s a big building.
  </p>
  <p id="742">
   Q: Oh, big buildings, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="743">
   A: Big building, well, I would say the length of my — this, my house, and there be anywhere 30 to 40 people in each building.
  </p>
  <p id="744">
   Q: So it was like a barracks?
  </p>
  <p id="745">
   A: It was a barrack, yes. And 1n — each side had a couple windows in it, and a big stove, and brick stove for heat, and for you — there was some cooking you could cook up there, but it was a big stove.
  </p>
  <p id="746">
   Q: So di — were — was everybody responsible for their own food, their own cooking at this place?
  </p>
  <p id="747">
   A: Well, there was — we didn’t have t — anything to cook, first of all.
  </p>
  <p id="748">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="749">
   A: So we were rely — we had to rely on what was in the camp. There was a bakery, and there was a, what they called restaurant, where, if you had money, and you had a coupon, you could buy some soup, and of course, you could buy your allowance January 25, 2015 of bread. Everybody, every person, child and old people were assigned 200 grams of bread, black bread, which amounted sometime to a couple of slices. We were assigned that much a day, and we could buy it. That — no more, no less, but that was what we could buy.
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   Q: So, in other words, you weren’t given food.
  </p>
  <p id="751">
   A: No, we had to buy it.
  </p>
  <p id="752">
   Q: And in the beginning, how did you buy it, if you had no money’?
  </p>
  <p id="753">
   A: Well, we had some money with us.
  </p>
  <p id="754">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="755">
   A: We brought some money because at that time in — in Nowogrodek, the — the currency already was Russian dru — ruble.
  </p>
  <p id="756">
   Q: Okay, let me go back for that, I didn’t think of this before. Your family had been well-to-do, and when the Soviets took over, then they nationalized and took away your businesses. But wer — were you given any compensation?
  </p>
  <p id="757">
   A: No, no, I don’t know, but my mother would get paid —
  </p>
  <p id="758">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="759">
   A: — for her work.
  </p>
  <p id="760">
   Q: And so that’s where she had the rubles from. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="761">
   A: Well, we also had — it turned out my mother has quite a bit of money. We, among other things we had a beautiful horse. And the young man that worked for us, and he still lived with us when Russians came in, told my mother that he heard, among men, that they were goin — the Russians were going to take our horse away. But he suggested that he — he even had the person that was willing to buy our horse, somebody connected to the Russians, that he would buy our horse. And my mother sold that horse, and she got quite a bit of money for it.
  </p>
  <p id="762">
   Q: And she took that one you left.
  </p>
  <p id="763">
   A: And sh — and it turned out, that was the money that saved us in Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="764">
   Q: That’s an interesting point. I wanted to — to get a sense of when you had —
  </p>
  <p id="765">
   A: Yes, we —
  </p>
  <p id="766">
   Q: — when you took clothes and no food, then you were in a — in —
  </p>
  <p id="767">
   A: — yeah, I — I— w-we never seen the money, my mother never showed it to us. But I know that for a fact, that she sold the horse, and I didn’t know how much she got. Of course, I got to know it later, when we were outside Russia.
  </p>
  <p id="768">
   Q: Mm-hm. So when you first got there, she had a way of being able to buy food for you.
  </p>
  <p id="769">
   A: Well, it was — you know, whatever was assigned to us. And of course, she got — she was one of the first that she got a job. Her job was to bring water from the river, January 25, 2015 that was farther on, not wer — next to our camp, there was a area about a couple kilometers from there, where there was a spring. And she would bring clear water. Sh — what she would have to do 1s fill the wooden barrels, which were on this wood — on this horse-drawn sled. She would have to go to the — chop the ice, fill ti — with the bucket, walk up and fill up the barrels, and then take it to the bakery, take the water there. Again, dip the water out of the barrels and take it to the barrels inside the bakery. She would do that all day long. It wou — believe me, I helped her sometime, it was a back blake — breaking job. And especially, she used to wear a sack in front of her as a apron. From splashing water and freezing, she sounded like she was a— she was armor, th-the — the ice so —
  </p>
  <p id="770">
   Q: It would freeze, huh?
  </p>
  <p id="771">
   A: — freeze, it would freeze. She — but she never gave up, she worked, because she had six mouths to feed.
  </p>
  <p id="772">
   Q: Yeah, yeah. Your grandmother too.
  </p>
  <p id="773">
   A: Well, that’s right. Well, all of us, were si-six of us.
  </p>
  <p id="774">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="775">
   A: So, she worked very hard.
  </p>
  <p id="776">
   Q: Was your sister put to work? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="777">
   A: When my sister turned 16, I believe — anybody over the age of 16 had to work. And lucky for — for her, she got a job in the local nursery, so she took care of little children. At least she didn’t have to work in — because the — all the other — and the other industry was logging.
  </p>
  <p id="778">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="779">
   A: And eventually my mother worked there too. What the de — women would do, when the men felled the trees, the women would chop the branches, and clear the snow so the — the horse-drawn drivers would haul the logs up to main drag, and then big, huge sleds, pulled by the tractors, would dr-draw — would draw those logs to the river, which again in the spring would be floated to the destination whate — whatever it was.
  </p>
  <p id="780">
   Q: I want to go back to one point, just to make it clear, and it’s about the food. That is, you were able to buy food for yourselves if you had the money, but not as much as you wanted to.
  </p>
  <p id="781">
   A: Only one bre — specially the bread, that was assigned to you.
  </p>
  <p id="782">
   Q: So in other words, it was rationed, but it wasn’t handed out.
  </p>
  <p id="783">
   A: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="784">
   Q: It was rationed in the sense that you could only get a certain portion.
  </p>
  <p id="785">
   A: That’s right. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="786">
   Q: And you had to pay for it.
  </p>
  <p id="787">
   A: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="788">
   Q: Okay. And that was with all food?
  </p>
  <p id="789">
   A: Exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="790">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="791">
   A: The — the only thing is, all the time we were there, we never had any — even the smallest amount of sugar. The — n-no butter, no meat. I nev —
  </p>
  <p id="792">
   Q: So what did you have, what did you eat?
  </p>
  <p id="793">
   A: Bread.
  </p>
  <p id="794">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="795">
   A: Moi-— mainly bread. Sometime later, in — when we were already a couple years in Russia, in there — well, maybe a year, they allowed f— us to receive parcels from Poland. And sometime — my grandmother, sometime some friends — as a matter of fact, we received a package of food from one of the Jews of Nowogrodek that owed my father some money. And he — he looked into it and found our address where we were at, and send us lifesaving food that we’re — I’m still grateful for it. So, like I said before, there were Jews, and there were Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="796">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="797">
   A: Just like there are Poles and there are Poles. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="798">
   Q: Thank you for that. Thank you for sharing that. Oh, do you remember what it was that was in that package?
  </p>
  <p id="799">
   A: I think it — most of it was pork belly, which is, to us, was — God, 1t was —
  </p>
  <p id="800">
   Q: There’s a lot you can do with pork belly.
  </p>
  <p id="801">
   A: Exactly. Especially when you’re starving, a little bit of fat —
  </p>
  <p id="802">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="803">
   A: — 1s — it’s a treasure.
  </p>
  <p id="804">
   Q: Yeah. So, did anyone get sick here?
  </p>
  <p id="805">
   A: Lot of people. Within a, I would say six months of being in that camp, we started losing some infants, some babies. There was no — women didn’t have enough milk to feed the babies, there was no milk to be had. The babies were starving, they were dying. Pretty soon, about a kilometer behind our camp, on a little hill, started appear wood crosses. And after children, little children, the older people started dying. Within a year, we must have lost oh, at least 50 people, older people. Our camp consisted of people from two different parts of Poland. Half of us were from Nowogrodek, and half were from the southern part of where — what was — what is now Ukraine, close to the Lwow. So there were people from two — two different parts of Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="806">
   Q: In — how large was the camp, population-wise. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="807">
   A: It was about, I would say, close to 500 people.
  </p>
  <p id="808">
   Q: Oh, that’s a lot.
  </p>
  <p id="809">
   A: Quite a few. There were, as far as Russians, there was one man, commander — commandant, we called him commandant. And there was one KGB man, and one bakers with his family. And there was one Russian 1-1n th — a woman, which wer — she was in charge of the restaurant.
  </p>
  <p id="810">
   Q: That’s an important position.
  </p>
  <p id="811">
   A: Very important. The rest of it was Polish people.
  </p>
  <p id="812">
   Q: And — how — what was their manner towards you, how did they behave towards you?
  </p>
  <p id="813">
   A: Well, of course, the — the commandant wasn’t bad man, but the — but the KGB, he was typical communist. To him, the only thing that mattered was his party, his nation, and he tried to convince us that we should be grateful that we wound up in Russia. Within about six months, they opened a school, wi-with one teacher, Russian, of course. And everybody, all the children, until 16 years, they had to go to school. And of course, we didn’t mind subjects like math and arc — physics, chemistry, or whatever. But of course they also tried to convince us again of the advantages of communist system, which didn’t work with us at all.
  </p>
  <p id="814">
   Q: So how did it — did children just stay silent when this sort of — January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="815">
   A: Well, we — we learn how to go along with them.
  </p>
  <p id="816">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="817">
   A: Just to get a ga — got along them. They — I — I was already twel — like I said, I was 12 years old, and what happened to me once, sometime we would sit on the bench, couple of our boys, and we sing our Polish national songs. And they through — we were trying to get our teacher mad. And one day he called me in and he told me if I keep it up, nothing may happen to me, but my mother wi — may wind up in — in jail. So of course, we stopped doing that, too.
  </p>
  <p id="818">
   Q: What kind of interaction was there with the KGB men? Like what — what was his — what was his function? How did he — how did he — what was his role in your life? Did he come and just talk to people, or did he —
  </p>
  <p id="819">
   A: Well, he wanted — he wanted to make sure we were afraid of him.
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   Q: So how did he ensure that?
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   A: Well, his manner, first of all, his manner. He would march into to the room, told the kids, sit down. You know, his voice, his manner, and h-he would really rough kind of a talk, let us know that he was in a cha — in charge, he was the boss.
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   Q: Was there informing going on?
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   A: Very — if there was, it must have been very little, because we were — pe-people were very, very well in touch with another. If there was, I never heard of any. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: Okay. So it wasn’t the same sort of situation as even back home, where people started being afraid of what they would say in — in public.
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: No, in the camp — in the camp, wa-wa-wa — it was w-w-wa — solidarity was a main thing.
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: And, where did these officials live? How did they live?
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   A: They had their own quarters. There was special barrack. In this special barrack they — the baker has his couple rooms in there, next to the bakery, and so the — the woman that’s in charge of restaurant, and the KGB and — and the commander was — they had th-their own — their own building.
  </p>
  <p id="828">
   Q: And you said the commandant was not such a bad guy.
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   A: No, he — he — he was authority, but he didn’t over — didn’t abuse it.
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   A: He — maybe he felt sorry for us, of anything.
  </p>
  <p id="832">
   Q: Okay. And so it was mostly what he didn’t do, rather than what he did.
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   A: Exactly, exactly.
  </p>
  <p id="834">
   Q: Mm-hm. So, you — it took half a year for you to be in school after you arrived, so what did you do in that half year?
  </p>
  <p id="835">
   A: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. In the winter, there wasn’t much you could do really, because eventually there were either four or five feet of January 25, 2015 snow sometime. And in the — you were sometimes so cold that you couldn’t even breathe in the cold air, because 1t was — when you — if you didn’t have anything in front of your mouth, you could feel like knives, okay, cutting into your lungs. So you always had to have something in you — in front of your face.
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   Q: And your mother would work in this sort of situation?
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   A: Yes, she did. Unless it got to be about — below 40 degrees, then nobody worked. But if it was warmer than that, then everybody had to go work, and men w-worked falling trees, and women doing the rest of it.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   Q: Here’s a part I don’t understand. I understand that she goes to a spring to get water in the summertime, to haul it back up, but in the winter there’s all this snow outside.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   A: Well, di — di — you had to shovel — you have to shovel the snow wherever you could. Sometime it was like a tunnel between the — on the each side there be about five feet of snow, and you just go. And the roads, with the passing of the sleds, eventually, you know, it was a track that you could go by.
  </p>
  <p id="840">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   A: And of course, the snow lasted about Ma-May — May sometime, middle of May, before the snows would start to melt.
  </p>
  <p id="842">
   Q: That’s a long time. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="843">
   A: That’s a long time. By June, it wer — snow was gone and then summer right away would start.
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   Q: Would it be hot in summer?
  </p>
  <p id="845">
   A: Well, I wouldn’t say hot, but it was nice and warm, and it’s — the beauty of nature up there at that time, everything explodes. Everything grows so fast, I never seen anything grow that fast in that humid, warm air. And as a matter of fact, if it wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would have survived. As soon as it got warm, some — a different kind of mushrooms would appear in the forest. And children — and I was among them, we would spend at least half a day, every other day, picking mushrooms. And later on, all kinds of berries: blackberries, raspberry — wild raspberries. And like I said before, if 1t wasn’t for nature, I don’t know if we would have survived. The problem was, we could not preserve any of it for wintertime, so we had to consume it right there. Sometime we would bring a bucketful of mushrooms, cook it and eat it for next couple meals. And that was my job, picking mushrooms, picking berries.
  </p>
  <p id="846">
   Q: Had you done that at home?
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   A: Mushrooms, yes, and berries of course, too. But I do — I done it for different reasons.
  </p>
  <p id="848">
   Q: For pleasure. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   A: For pleasure. Here, it was to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And that was the summertime.
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   A: Summer —
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   Q: So the — so there was no — like a fence around this settlement. You were allowed to go into —
  </p>
  <p id="853">
   A: We were allowed, but there were hundreds and hundreds of kilometers of nothing but virgin forest. And we were not in touch with any — eight kilometer from our camp was the — what Russians call was baza, which is like a center, gog — government’s center, where they control all the activities in the neighborhood, for — where were — they just decided where the logging would be. It was all run by — by Russians, of course. And about 20 some kilometers farther, there were a couple of Russian villages, which at time, we were given permission — we were given the pass, that we could go to those villages and trade, barter for some of the clothes that we brought with us from Poland for some food.
  </p>
  <p id="854">
   Q: And did you?
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   A: Oh yes, I would go with my mother and carry a sack, maybe oh, 20 — 20 some pounds of flour, or some — some wa — whatever else we could. That helped, of course, sur — to survive.
  </p>
  <p id="856">
   Q: But other than that, you didn’t have any contact with any local people. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   A: The — the only other person that I remember, there was a young woman. She was about 18 years old. She was a mail girl, she used to bring our mail from the baza to our camp, and she would carry that, pass it on to every barrack. And she was a—a think when we got there, she was a hundred percent communist. She would t — always tell how much she hated us, and for all different reasons that she would give. But be — by the time we were leaving camp, she was our best friend. She would come and pray with us, as a matter of fact.
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   Q: How did that happen?
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   A: I don’t know how it happened, but she finally came to conclusion that we were the ones who were suffering, and we were the ones that were penalized for no reason at all.
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   Q: And that was without you telling her so?
  </p>
  <p id="861">
   A: Well, she became a — one of the friends.
  </p>
  <p id="862">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="863">
   A: And I — I — it was like a miracle. She ta — changed her feelings completely. Her name was Lisa.
  </p>
  <p id="864">
   Q: Lisa.
  </p>
  <p id="865">
   A: Lisa.
  </p>
  <p id="866">
   Q: Uh-huh. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="867">
   A: And we — just happened that in our camp was a nun. She was a sister of my father’s friend. And Russians didn’t know she was a nun. If she — if they did, most likely she would wind up in jail somewhere. But she would have classes, religion classes with us. Boys would stand guard around the barracks, in all corners, and she would talk to children, small children, about religion, about Christ and that. And why we were watching, making sure that nobody would spot us.
  </p>
  <p id="868">
   Q: And nobody did?
  </p>
  <p id="869">
   A: And nobody did. As a matter of fact, she was saved. She wa — she was — she went back to Poland, and she even — she was in charge of monastery later, in one of the Polish towns, and she visited my grandmother when my — my grandmother went back to Poland from India.
  </p>
  <p id="870">
   Q: Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: Yes. We called her sister wi — not so much sister, as ciocia, which means aunt.
  </p>
  <p id="872">
   Q: What was her name?
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   A: Sh— God. Last name was Petrowski(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="874">
   Q: Petrowski(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="875">
   A: Petrowski(ph), but 1— I don’t remember her — her monastery’s name. I don’t remember that.
  </p>
  <p id="876">
   Q: It’s okay. So summertime was a reprieve from the cold. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="877">
   A: Oh God, it was. But you have to realize, our clothes, my first year, were in shreds. I — my older sister and I had one pair of shoes —
  </p>
  <p id="878">
   Q: Between you.
  </p>
  <p id="879">
   A: — between us. W-Walking in the woods barefoot, is sometime even dangerous. My — my whole everything, pants, jacket, everything was in shreds. We happened to receive a parcel from Poland. I don’t remember who it was from, but whoever sent it, wrapped it in a piece of cloth. My grandmother says, Adam, I’m going to make you a pair of pants from it. And she did. She sewed it by hand, can you imagine that? And she made me a pair of pants. There was one problem with it.
  </p>
  <p id="880">
   Q: What was that?
  </p>
  <p id="881">
   A: On my seat, there was a permanent marker’s address. I — I had la — I had to su- sur-survive lot of ho — laughs —

   A: — my butt.
  </p>
  <p id="886">
   Q: Oh man, I just had another question about this, and — let me think. Clothes — hygiene. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="887">
   A: Oh God, it was — there’s such a thing as Russian bath, where they not only bathe, it’s a Steam room, and next to it is the place where they put all their clothes that they take off, and it’s so pr — it’s so hot up there, that it’s supposed to kill all the lice —
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: Did it?
  </p>
  <p id="889">
   A: — because, let’s face it, in the conditions that we were in, no soap, no soap, you just wash with water. The pi — oh — only laundry you could do was in the water without any soap, and lack of clothes breeds all kinds of filth, lice among them. So my mother had a routine. Every couple days we had to strip, and we would look through our clothes, killing all whatever was moving.
  </p>
  <p id="890">
   Q: Oh my. Oh my.
  </p>
  <p id="891">
   A: It’s terri — yo-you don’t — people that didn’t go through it, don’t realize what a hell it is.
  </p>
  <p id="892">
   Q: Not to be able to do something as simple as have some soap, and wash.
  </p>
  <p id="893">
   A: Exactly, exactly.

   A: Banya(ph), yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: Mm-hm, so it’s something like a sauna. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="897">
   A: Ec — exactly, exactly. And the Russians are very proud of it. To them, it’s a part of civilization. And they were saying that, what kind of civilized Poland it was that they did eve — da — didn’t even have the lice — lice killing equipment.
  </p>
  <p id="898">
   Q: Well, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="899">
   A: So we’re not civilized to them.
  </p>
  <p id="900">
   Q: No lice, no equipment.
  </p>
  <p id="901">
   A: No equipment.
  </p>
  <p id="902">
   Q: I talked about — so we talked about hyg — what about, in the forest, were there ever any little animals?
  </p>
  <p id="903">
   A: This was a part of it that still, you know, I still — when I remember it, comes to my mind. Normally you would expect to have some wolves, bears. There were none. There were totally none. The — the smallest — the animals that I seen were weasels. And of course, you couldn’t even come close to, they were so fast. The only other thing th — as a kid, I would try to do some fishing, and sometime with the success, which meant that we had a feast.
  </p>
  <p id="904">
   Q: That evening, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="905">
   A: That evening, I would catch a catfish about this size, and God, that was a feast.
  </p>
  <p id="906">
   Q: That’s like about 18 inches, 20 inch long catfish.
  </p>
  <p id="907">
   A: Yes, it was, yeah. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="908">
   Q: Yeah, even two feet.
  </p>
  <p id="909">
   A: And I caught it few times.
  </p>
  <p id="910">
   Q: And how — without a fishing rod?
  </p>
  <p id="911">
   A: Well, we would — we would take a sack [indecipherable] sack, put it on the sticks, make it like a netting of 1t, and w-w — drag it around bushes or whatever in the water, and try to chase it. And sometime we were lucky enough that the fish would j — flow into it.
  </p>
  <p id="912">
   Q: Into the sack, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="913">
   A: Into the sack, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="914">
   Q: Were there ever official meetings that were held for the entire settlement, that you had to go to, or anything?
  </p>
  <p id="915">
   A: No, no, never — never had one.
  </p>
  <p id="916">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="918">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="919">
   A: — that will be a— you know, the — the — especially the KGB man.
  </p>
  <p id="920">
   Q: So he would come in and hold a meeting for the whole barracks?
  </p>
  <p id="921">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="922">
   Q: And what would he usually talk about? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="923">
   A: Well, about the success and — and li — of Soviet Union, of communism, of the future is only with them, and all that kind of stuff.
  </p>
  <p id="924">
   Q: Was there a radio in the camp?
  </p>
  <p id="925">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="926">
   Q: Were there newspapers that were ever delivered?
  </p>
  <p id="927">
   A: No, we-we — yes, but very few, because Russians would use the newspaper to st — to roll their cigarettes with.
  </p>
  <p id="928">
   Q: Oh really.
  </p>
  <p id="929">
   A: Yeah, that’s what they used.
  </p>
  <p id="930">
   Q: Mm-hm.

   Q: How often would there be visits to the settlement from the outside? Like the post girl, would she come once a week, or —
  </p>
  <p id="933">
   A: She would co — she would be about couple times a week, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="934">
   Q: Couple of ti— was this about the only communication that there would be with somebody”? January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="935">
   A: Well, except the — some of the people worked in the — that baza place, they would be in touch with some Russians up there, but otherwise, there were very few Russians that would come to the camp.
  </p>
  <p id="936">
   Q: So it — it really gets — it sounds like you were very remote, and quite isolated.
  </p>
  <p id="937">
   A: Totally — totally remote. Totally remote. And even to — the only place we could go without permission, which were — without the pass, was to the baza. And farther on, to the villages, we would have to have a stri — slip of paper, pass, that we could go, and th-the signing when we have to leave, and when we have to come back. And Russian people — excuse me, the older people, when they made sure that nobody 1s listening, they would made the sign of cross, and tell us how they believe in God, and how they feel sorry for us. But the young people, they were telling us that w-we deserve wherever we get in.
  </p>
  <p id="938">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="939">
   A: The communists was — they were through and through communists.
  </p>
  <p id="940">
   Q: Isn’t that interesting, that an older generation saw through that, wasn’t convinced of it.
  </p>
  <p id="941">
   A: Absolutely. And ee — the — some of them even had the holy pictures hidden somewhere. And when — again, when nobody was looking, they would show it to us. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="942">
   Q: This would be when you would be going to trade, or something like that?
  </p>
  <p id="943">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="944">
   Q: Would you like some water?
  </p>
  <p id="945">
   A: Maybe a little while.
  </p>
  <p id="946">
   Q: Let’s — let’s cut then, yeah. [break]. Okay, so tell me, is there anything else that I haven’t asked about, about life in the settlement, life in the camp, that you think is important for people to know about?
  </p>
  <p id="947">
   A: Well, yo — in this situation [indecipherable] that it’s really gets to you, the helplessness, and the — it gets to not just grown-ups, but also to children, that we are dependent on that one guy up there in th — that KGB man, whoever, that we don’t count, whatever we think, whatever we feel doesn’t count, it’s — we are helpless, totally helpless and hopeless. And eventually brings in depression, and sometime, you know, it affects people different way. Some bec — become where they pick fights, aggressive. Some were totally cut off from the rest of the population.
  </p>
  <p id="948">
   Q: They retreat in themselves.
  </p>
  <p id="949">
   A: They [indecipherable] themselves. And it’s a very sad situation, very sad. And the hunger is a terp — terrible feeling. It’s — it gets to you to the extent that you think of eating, you dream of eating, your ho — your whole concentration is on getting January 25, 2015 some food. And believe me, in all — most of that time we were there, that’s what our main interest, and ma — our — our main effort was, to get some to eat.
  </p>
  <p id="950">
   Q: So people changed?
  </p>
  <p id="951">
   A: Oh, totally, totally, totally, totally. And the family becomes unit, and if you work together, you survive. If you don’t, you don’t have much choice but give up. A lot of people did give up, and pretty soon, there were the — the crosses on that hill multiply again.
  </p>
  <p id="952">
   Q: So were there people who were deported without their families, for example.
  </p>
  <p id="953">
   A: There were a few, yes, there were a few people.
  </p>
  <p id="954">
   Q: And th — so if you were alone, you had far less chance.
  </p>
  <p id="955">
   A: Exactly. Because family held together, helped to stay — you know, had your mind set out to s — on survival.
  </p>
  <p id="956">
   Q: So you went through the winter of 1940, the summer of 1940 and the winter of 1941. And, was that second winter pretty similar to the first?
  </p>
  <p id="957">
   A: Well, winter itself was similar, but as far as we were concerned, we were 1n much worse shape, physically.
  </p>
  <p id="958">
   Q: Okay, ec — describe it.
  </p>
  <p id="959">
   A: Mainly —
  </p>
  <p id="960">
   Q: Yeah. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="961">
   A: — mainly physically. We were — we were starving, you know, eating just bread, and very little of it, doesn’t bi-build up any strength, any — you — you are hungry most of the time.
  </p>
  <p id="962">
   Q: So you were weaker with —
  </p>
  <p id="963">
   A: You were weaker — weaker physically, and sometime, like I said before, people got to the point where they were giving up.
  </p>
  <p id="964">
   Q: So did they commit suicide?
  </p>
  <p id="965">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="966">
   Q: They just died.
  </p>
  <p id="967">
   A: They didn’t have to, they didn’t have to, they just laid down and died. And it happened, a lot of people happened, and — to a lot of people.
  </p>
  <p id="968">
   Q: Were there any other transports that came after you?
  </p>
  <p id="969">
   A: No, no. No more people. We’re di — we’re — a — eventually, we know now that there were other transports, but at that time, at our place, we didn’t have a idea.
  </p>
  <p id="970">
   Q: Okay, you would have been the only ones.
  </p>
  <p id="971">
   A: We were — we were getting some mail from Poland, but whenever people tried to tell us something, it was cut out by censorship. We would get the letters with the parts of it cut out.
  </p>
  <p id="972">
   Q: I see. January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="973">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="974">
   Q: I see. So the second winter was a lot harder than the first one?
  </p>
  <p id="975">
   A: Positively, positively, positively. Our clothes were already in shreds, and we were very, very bad shape physically. Wit — what’s happened, second summer, the authorities told us that we can try to have a gardens.
  </p>
  <p id="976">
   Q: Oh, you were allowed to have ga —
  </p>
  <p id="977">
   A: We were allowed to — to have a gardens. So we — they divided some of the open area in the camp into plots, and it — we drew lots, and it just happened that we — our part — our lot was very far in the — practically in the woods. What turned out that nobody drew a lot which was right in front of our barrack. So my mother went to the — the ca — ca — our commander, and ask him if she could cha — trade the — the — and she did. So we had a — about, I would say 50 by 50 feet plot of land that we could — we could —
  </p>
  <p id="978">
   Q: Plant.
  </p>
  <p id="979">
   A: — plant. It just happened, this is a story in itself. Second summer, my mother and I, we went to the village, which is located about 28 kilometers, to trade, I think it was my father’s jacket or something, for some 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes. The problem was that we’d had no means of bringing those potatoes to the camp. So we told the Russians people to keep it for us, and we will come back for it in the winter. January 25, 2015 It just again happened that my mother was sick. She lifted something heavy while she was working in the woods, and hurt her back, she couldn’t get up. She was in bed. And th — we were really starving. We had a family get together, and decided that we have t — my brother, who was that time just eight years old — no, I’m sorry, he was practically nine already. No, he was eight years old. And I was practically 13 — no, I was 13 years old. So, that were two of us, right in the middle of winter, we have to go and get those potatoes. Twenty-eight kilometers in the winter, 30 below zero.
  </p>
  <p id="980">
   Q: Oh my gosh.
  </p>
  <p id="981">
   A: I, previous summer, I work — I made a sled, I built a s — myself a sled. We were gonna use that sled to bring those potatoes. So, my mother gave me and my brother slice of bread. That had to last us two days. And early in the morning we marched with dragging that sled. We went to, a 13 and a eight, practically nine year old boys, 28 kilometers to bring the 60 or 80 pounds of potatoes.
  </p>
  <p id="982">
   Q: Potatoes. And you did?
  </p>
  <p id="983">
   A: We walked all day. When I close my eyes now, I still see when we got out of the woods, there was a small hill, and on top of the hill there were some hats — hats, with the chimneys, and the smoke coming from the chi — it looked like picture from heaven, after walking all day. I found the hats, with my — where the potatoes were. January 25, 2015 We got in hat — the room was full of people. Turned out there were people that were going, men mostly, that were going to go to our camp with horses and — to help working in the woods, in the logging. I still remember the smell of the sweat, bodies, and the cigars, or smo — I mean, s — pipes and smoking. We slept all on the grou — on the floor. Woke up in next morning about five, six o’clock in the morning. I went outside. Turned out during the night, about 12 inches of snow fell.
  </p>
  <p id="984">
   Q: Oh my goodness. You were saved. You were saved, cause it could have fallen on you.
  </p>
  <p id="985">
   A: But this was — going through the virgin forest was just a, you know, path cut out through the — through the woods. I had the idea. I started going to every man, asking if they will allow us to tie our sled to their horse — horse drawn sled, you know, to help us.
  </p>
  <p id="986">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="987">
   A: None of them would allow it.
  </p>
  <p id="988">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="989">
   A: Finally, there was a woman with a young girl, most likely my age. And I ask her. First she refuse, and then she change her mind. She says, all right, you can do it on one condition, that you lead my horse. Of course, I agreed to it. So we put our bag of potatoes on the sled, covered it with the blanket and some straw. My son — my January 25, 2015 brother would sit on it, and the — the sled was full of about five feet high with hay for the horses that would be fed on the — 1n our camp. And the two women climbed on the top of that sled hay, and I would lead it. We were about the last ones of the whole caravan of those sleds. E-Everything was fine, until we got to about the middle of the distance to our camp. There was a steep hill, downwards went the road, and on the bottom there was a stream, which of course was frozen solid now. And there the pass — the road turned left. Well, we were coming down th-the sleds that went ahead of us, cleaned the road pretty well, so when we were coming, it was pretty slick going. I kept holding the horse as much as I could, but the — gradually horse start to galloping, faster and faster. Finally I couldn’t keep up with him, so I let go. The sled with the — went all the way down to the hill, and made the turn. As it made the turn to the left, it slid sideways, hit the embankment of snow, and the two women were catapult out of the top of the sled, into the big pile of snow. All I could see is two pair of legs sticking out. Of course, my brother turn over too.
  </p>
  <p id="990">
   Q: What happened to the potatoes?
  </p>
  <p id="991">
   A: Well, they were — they were turned over too, into the snow. It took us about half an hour to straighten out the sled, and put back the potatoes on — on the sled [indecipherable] with my little sled, my brother on it. By the end of the day, we were at our camp. 100January 25, 2015

  <p id="992">
   Q: Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="993">
   A: Next day I was walking, and I seen that woman splitting logs for her fireplace. She wasn’t much good at it, but I was. For next hour or so I split all the wood that she had. That was my thank you to her for being so good and help us, because I don’t know how we would have made it back that night, to the camp. So she was good to me, and I repaid it by —
  </p>
  <p id="994">
   Q: Splitting her logs.
  </p>
  <p id="995">
   A: — splitting her woods for her.
  </p>
  <p id="996">
   Q: Amazing.
  </p>
  <p id="997">
   A: Amazing.
  </p>
  <p id="998">
   Q: Amazing.
  </p>
  <p id="999">
   A: And when I think about it now, my brother wasn’t even nine years old.
  </p>
  <p id="1000">
   Q: And the potatoes, did they help?
  </p>
  <p id="1001">
   A: Oh, God. Wa — there were — there were — that — I don’t remember how long ago we went to sleep with our bellies full. The potatoes tasted better than any before and any time after, when they did. And for next month or so, and when — when we got the plot of land, when my mother would peel the potatoes, her — she — when there was a eye, with the possibility of growing, she would make a big, deep cut and save 101January 25, 2015 it. So we planted those pieces, and next year we had a — some — our own fresh potatoes growing.
  </p>
  <p id="1002">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1003">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1004">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="1005">
   A: That was part of the good story.
  </p>
  <p id="1006">
   Q: It is. It is, but what a difficult — what a difficult thing to do. And for little boys, I mean, as you were starting to tell this, I was thinking, my goodness, those potatoes will freeze on that — on that journey.
  </p>
  <p id="1007">
   A: Well, it was like I said, we covered with — with the straw, with the blanket, and my brother was sitting on —
  </p>
  <p id="1008">
   Q: Sitting on top of it, like a chicken on some eggs.
  </p>
  <p id="1009">
   A: Exactly, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1010">
   Q: So, by this time, let’s say, the second winter goes by, and that’s the winter of 1941, and then the summer is when you plant, or —
  </p>
  <p id="1011">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1012">
   Q: — yes, you plant those —
  </p>
  <p id="1013">
   A: Yes, yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1014">
   Q: Now, in June 1941 is when Germany attacked the Soviet Union. 102January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1015">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1016">
   Q: Did your lives change after that?
  </p>
  <p id="1017">
   A: Well, the irony of it, that we, that year we got what Russians call the amnesty. To have — to have amnesty, you have to commit something, right?
  </p>
  <p id="1018">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1019">
   A: Well, I don’t know what we committed.
  </p>
  <p id="1020">
   Q: But you got amnesty anyway.
  </p>
  <p id="1021">
   A: But we got amnesty anyway. And who do we thank for that?
  </p>
  <p id="1022">
   Q: Who?
  </p>
  <p id="1023">
   A: Hitler. So, is it the irony that we have Hitler to thank for our freedom. Now, the way it worked, Russians at that time, when Germany attacked Russia, were in such a bad shape, within a few months, Germany was right into the Russian territory. They went through the eastern Poland, into German authority. Russians were looking for help, for allies. At that time, Russia held about a quarter of a million Polish soldiers in it — prison of war camps. Russians wanted to use those men to defend Russia. They tr — to — got in touch with Polish government in exile in ri — in London, to form Polish army in Russia. They agreed — Polish government agreed on one condition. That they will release rest of the people, too. That included us. So that’s what the amnesty was about. And we were officially told by — by officials. 103January 25, 2015

  <p id="1024">
   Q: By the commandant, or —

  </p>
  <p id="1026">
   Q: Not the KGB man.
  </p>
  <p id="1027">
   A: No, no, commandant, that we are free people. We were given passes, legi — le — legitimacy.
  </p>
  <p id="1028">
   Q: Legitimization.
  </p>
  <p id="1029">
   A: That’s right. That we could travel in Russia, that we can get supply of bread whenever w — it was available. But we were — main thing, we were free to leave the camp.
  </p>
  <p id="1030">
   Q: And when did this — when did this come? When did this happen?
  </p>
  <p id="1031">
   A: This was fall of ’41.
  </p>
  <p id="1032">
   Q: So, it was several months after Germany attacked.
  </p>
  <p id="1033">
   A: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="1034">
   Q: So in the fall of °41, when you finally have some potatoes of your own.
  </p>
  <p id="1035">
   A: That’s right. That’s true, that’s very true.
  </p>
  <p id="1036">
   Q: Your ha — you’re told that you are free to go.
  </p>
  <p id="1037">
   A: We were free to go, but go fra — where?
  </p>
  <p id="1038">
   Q: Yeah. 104January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1039">
   A: We were told that there’s a Polish army being organized in the southern Russia, in the — in the Kazakhstan, in the Uzbekistan. We were told that there’s — that’s where the Polish army is being organized. But how do we get there? This 1s 3,000 kilometers from where we are. Now, it was due south wi — by this time the German armies were already approaching Moscow, so there was no way we could go straight south. A lot of people were hesitating, didn’t want to leave the camp because after all, there was some security here, and if we leave camp, who — then what? My mother was a different — of different opinion. She says she won’t stay here any more, we have to leave. And sure enough, we — my sister went to a — the village, which was about 20 some mi — kilometers to, from — from our camp, and next thing we know, she came back couple days later with the horse-drawn sled, with the farmer, and that we can leave the camp —
  </p>
  <p id="1040">
   Q: With him?
  </p>
  <p id="1041">
   A: — and he will take us to the — that village, and from there there was only few kilometers to the railroad station — railroad that was being built. It — it wasn’t built yet, they were just building the railroad. So we packed whatever we still had, things, and traveled over for a day and a half, we traveled to that village.
  </p>
  <p id="1042">
   Q: So you left fairly soon afterwards?
  </p>
  <p id="1043">
   A: We - we left, it was — was winter of ’42. 105January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1044">
   Q: Two.
  </p>
  <p id="1045">
   A: I think it was January — January something, beginning of January, I think we left the camp. We got to that town, that village, and it turned out it was about 10 kilometers to the railroad sta — railroad. Not station, but railroad. Again, my mother bribed some of the people over there with some tobacco. And they told us that we can load in, into the — get into one of the freight cars that was bringing supplies, railroad supplies, and we traveled about three days. They closed the doors completely because they didn’t want anybody know what we — we were in the car. It was freezing. We had to walk most of the time to — to — not to freeze.
  </p>
  <p id="1046">
   Q: To keep warm.
  </p>
  <p id="1047">
   A: To keep warm. Finally we got to the town that we were originally dropped off —
  </p>
  <p id="1048">
   Q: Oh, where you had walked —
  </p>
  <p id="1049">
   A: — where we were brought.
  </p>
  <p id="1050">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1051">
   A: We got — turns out there were thousand people just like us out there, from different camps all over ye — Russia, that part of Russia. And within a few days the conditions were terrible, unbelievably terrible.
  </p>
  <p id="1052">
   Q: Were you all at the railroad station? 106January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   A: The railroad station. Finally is — we — somehow we found out that there was a train preparing to go south, which had some of those cars prepared for traveling, for deporting [indecipherable] people. So we got on the train.
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   Q: And was it also like freight trains, or was —
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   A: It wa — well, there were some empty cars, but just about everybody that was on that station, got on that train. Of course Polish people. Three months we traveled on that train.
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   Q: Oh my gosh.
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   A: Three months we traveled on that train. We lost more people on that train than in the camp.
  </p>
  <p id="1058">
   Q: Oh my gosh.
  </p>
  <p id="1059">
   A: The worst — the worst was when somebody got lost from the train, we never — we never found them. It just happened that my mother got lost. What would happen, we would get to the station, and people, some people from each car would run to the center of the town to see if they could buy, steal or whatever some food. And sometime when they were there, the train would go — would start going, and leave them behind. And like I said, most of the time, when train would leave those people, we never seen them again.
  </p>
  <p id="1060">
   Q: So what happened with your mother? 107January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1061">
   A: My mother was one of the people that went to get some food. In the meantime, they took our train and just moved it to different siding. When my mother came back to the original spot, who — the — whoever was in charge told her that our train left. She jumped on the next train and traveled for about three days, without sign of our train. So she decided that she must have missed it, and she started coming back. And would you know, she found us. Not only did she found us, but she brought about two loaves of bread with her.
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   Q: What a miracle.
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   A: Was a miracle. We were desperate. We were four children, and their grandma.
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   Q: Oh my.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   A: Four children and their grandma.
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   Q: Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   A: My dear, we were creatures from hell. Dirty. All through those three months, we never change clothes, we never washed. There was enough water for drinking, never mind washing or — or — our clothes or washing yourself. Can you imagine the stink? Forty people in the car. We were in one of the towns, I don’t remember the name now, big town. And all of a sudden, all through the train went the news that on a different siding, there’s a train just like ours, and in that train, there’s a priest that’s gonna say a mass. Believe me, everybody, whoever could stand on their feet, 108January 25, 2015 we run to that siding, and sure enough, there was in one of the cars, the gate — door was open, there was a table, and a young priest was saying a mass. He was in a shreds of clothes just like we were. Dirty, filthy, but you could tell he was a God’s man. We were kneeling on the snow, we were praying. We were singing Polish songs. At the end of 1t we usually sing a song which says, God, let us — give us — give us a chance to get to freedom, get to pola — get back to Poland, to our cri — our country.
  </p>
  <p id="1068">
   Q: I can’t imagine what that scene must have been like.
  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   A: It gaved us spirit. It gave us a reason to live again. Believe me, it was one of the miracles that makes human do things that sometime you don’t think you can do it. Well, our luck was with us anyway. We got through Kazakhstan — just one — I wrote it in my life story. When we were going through Kazakhstan, the — the scenery was totally flat steppe.
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   Q: The steppes.
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   A: Steppes, yes. And I was looking through that small window, and what do I see? Right along the railroad tracks, on the snow, there’s a fox, a red fox. Was running parallel to a train, but at least he knew — you could tell he knew exactly where he was going, and we didn’t have the slightest idea where we were going.
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   Q: Oh my. Yeah. 109January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   A: It’s stuck in my mind now. Anyway, finally we got to the end — to bekist — paki — not Pakistan, it was Bekistan(ph). And there they told us to unload at one of the stations, I don’t remember now which one.
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   Q: Was it Tashkent?
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   A: No, no, it wasn’t Tashkent. But not far from it. And we — there were — they put is in the kolkhoz. You know what kolkhoz is?
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   Q: Explain, please.
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   A: Kolkhoz is a government farm.
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   A: Where people don’t own anything, they just work for a government farm. A farm was — they were raising cotton. This is main there, that’s what they grow in that part of Uzbekistan. Well, they assign us to the Uzbek family. They gave us a little room with a dirt floor, and my mother and my young — my older sister worked in the fields, and I worked 1n the smith shop.
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   Q: Was this Polish authorities, or Russian authorities?
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   A: Russian authorities. But turned out that there were already some Polish authorities in the area, too. Finally we contacted them. And they kept us — kept telling us to sit tight, they’Il notify us where and when we have to go. We spend, I don’t know, about four months up there, and working pretty hard. Finally, my 110January 25, 2015 mother again, she has enough. With the last thing that she still had — there were two more Polish families in the area. They bribed drivers that were going — what we heard was town about hundred kilometers from where we were at, where there was already Polish army post. So, one day we loaded up on the — on the truck, open truck, and for next 24 hours — it took them 24 hours to drive us that hundred kilometers. Every 20 some kilometers, they had to change the tires on the truck.
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   Q: Really? It was that bad.
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   A: That good. Finally, at night, we arrived on that station, where we’re su — we were told that there’s a Polish outpost. Sure enough, we unloaded at night, and we were sit — by this time it was nice and warm up there. This is south of Russia. So, I think it was some time in March or April already, and we were sitting against the wall on the — on the station. It started getting light, and we could hear men’s walk is with the military boots on the — on the platform. My mother jumped up and there was a— one sergeant and two soldiers coming towards us. My mother looked at him and run to him and started hugging him. He was a policeman from the Vorudek(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   Q: No kidding.
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   A: He was — the man was a — the sergeant was a policeman from the Vorudek(ph), that knew my parents very well. 111January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   Q: Oh my goodness.
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   A: From that time on our lives changed. Turned out that a quartermaster of the 22" regiment, that was stationed in the place — place was called Karmana. And he was a buddy of my father’s. Quartermaster. He made my mother seamstress, she — she put — he put her to work. My older sister wer — couldn’t go anywhere, because she suffered — she infect — got infected with typhoid. But my younger sister was — joined the girls — yo-young girls’ camp. My brother and I, we went to the boys’ camp. And also turned out — turned out that one day, while I was in the camp, I was told that I have to report to the colonel that was in charge of 22™ regiment. I got scared. I didn’t do anything wrong, I — I saluted everybody, and here I am told to report —
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   Q: Report.
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   A: — to the colonel, of — of all the people. Turned out he knew my father when they were young officers in the 1920. When he seen my name, he wanted to know if we know what happened to father. So that’s what he wanted me to report to him. But like I said, from that time on, our lives changed. Mother was secure, thi — we were secured.
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   Q: Did you get more food? 112January 25, 2015
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   A: Oh God. First time I was taken to the military mess, they get me vast pool of rice and r — and raisins. I ate about quarter of it and I couldn’t eat no more. I could not. I sat there and I cried because I can’t — couldn’t swallow any more.
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   Q: You were full?
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
   A: I guess my stomach shrunk so that it — there was no room for it already. But eventually, that went by. On the middle of August, 1942, we were put on the train from the Karmana, from the camp, and taken to the port on the Caspian Sea.
  </p>
  <p id="1094">
   Q: What was the name of the port?
  </p>
  <p id="1095">

  <p id="1099">
   A: Like sardines. My brother was on that ship, too. He was very sick. He wa — he had dysentery, which sometime it can kill you.

   Q: What if — what kind of a feeling was it?
  </p>
  <p id="1107">
   A: It’s like a — when the weight 1s dropped off your shoulders. That you could speak freely without, you know, looking if someone is watching you. That you’re your own master, you’re — you’re — you’re free. I was 14 years old. My — at that time, I was still in Russia, I was assigned to the military band, and I was learning how to play clarinet and violin. Clarinet, I was doing fine. Violin, I wasn’t. But our main job was drumming. When the orchestra was marching, we were, the eight of us, lined up in the front, drummers. And also, whenever we had to — other parades, we would take part of it.

And then in January 1943, we got orders to leave Iraq and go to Palestine, to join Polish military schools. There were so many of young boys that was rescued from Russia, from all different camps. They formed schools, from grade school that my — my brother was at — finally went through.

Every Friday my school would — all the companies would march, and we were on the parade grounds, and the officer would be reading names of our friends that were in Italy fighting, si — ones that were wounded, and ones that were killed. It was a very sad, sad — and that meant that the war will end, and that be the end of it, which 1s a total, total relief. Total. Specially fact that we were the winners, too.
