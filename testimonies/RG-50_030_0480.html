Russian occupation was everything against the education, not like in other part of this time -- a other part of the Poland, li-ike Austria, or Germany, was much easier to educate that -- himself. In Russian part was not so easy, and my father c-come back from the ne -- I call this prison, and start working, like I said before, for na -- state, and start educated himself. I remember I was maybe five years old, I remember good, to our house each days or two days, came some student from the Polytechnical Institute, and give the technical instruction, technical education for my father for a couple years.

  <p id="107">

  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: Yes, oh yes, we -- we was all the time a very political family. Why? Because my parents grow and grandparents grow in atmosphere where we was -- where the people like free Poland.

  </p>
  <p id="113">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   Q: -- or at least your father did. When you were going to school, were there Jewish kids in the school as well as Polish Catholic kids, or --
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   A: You see -- yes, I have couple -- ne -- not many, because you see, we was not too rich people. Before, the educated children was very costable. And one time in our family was four children, and you must pay the tuition. And before the war, it was not so easy. Each child costs, for example in gymnasium, mean the high school, was private high school, and was state high school. If you cannot go to state high school, you must pay. And this costs this time, 80 zloty, and fellow who work in the bank, like [indecipherable] or fellow who work in the post office, take only 200 dollars mon -- monthly. And you must pay for one child 80 zloty. And I was maybe lucky because my parents paid for me only part of this, because I was good student, and happened I pay less. And my two sister and brother, that’s was big money monthly, pay for education. And my father did pay and my mother said, I don’t need fur coats, I don’t need nothing, I need good, education children.

  </p>
  <p id="119">

And where I live, I live close to Vistula river, was not many Jew, and s -- Jewish people, and still was two young guy who was up to twa -- 14 years old, we was together in school, and you know, was very nice guy, on -- poor, and still was [indecipherable] this young people go to Palestine. And up to si -- 14 years old, this fellow has education, and later they both are interest in go to Palestine and be some carpenter or some mechanical something like this. And that’s was stop my connection with the Jewish young person. And still sa -- we was invited to later there, I maybe mentioned to Melamid family, where was on Bar Mitzvah and etcetera. That’s connection family who is jewi - our family with Jewish family in the same branch, the same business, the same trade. And during the high school time, was not many Jews, mostly it was like Catholic and the Protestant, not Jewish young people. In other words, this time, up to °39, in school was not close connection to young Jewish people. On the m-mem -- part of my family, from 1930 to 19 thir -- near ’42 - "44, na -- we was connected very closely to couple family, Jewish family in the Warsaw ghetto. And special after 1939, the -- some family from Wilno moved to Warsaw, a Jewish family wo -- who moved to Warsaw, and name call Epstein, and we was close, and very important for us this time, we na -- was family name Melamid.

  <p id="132">
   A: And for example, the concentration camp, very important thing. In Poland was, before the war, three and a half m-million Jewish people. The biggest concentration in Poland -- in Europe. Mean was for Jewish people, was some chance better like in Germany or France. And German know this after the war, and before too, the big concentration Jewish people in Poland, that’s, from my point of view, was created and yet -- and German created so many concentration camps in Poland. One of the important concentration camp was Auschwitz. The Auschwitz was built first couple weeks after a war was [indecipherable] 1939, and first prisoner was not Jewish people, was Catholic people. And which one Catholic people? All professors from university. All the lawyers, engineers, and clergy was sent first to concentration camp, Auschwitz. That’s first there was only Polish people was there, and was not directly kill, only hard labor created the deaths. 1941 start Jewish people there, and start the death camp. Concentration camp that’s the one part, people dying because was overwork. And death camp, was sent there and killed.

   A: That’s was the different and this must be straight, because I was in concentration camp, not in Auschwitz, only in Flossenbirg, that’s was political prison during -- before the war ’39, where Hitler put all opponents, own party, to concentration camp. Many German people was there, that’s was political prison. And that’s my own concentration camp.

  <p id="135">

   A: Ah yes, you ask me I -- I have many f -- I have not very close friend, and I -- Jewish people this time before -- during school, because in a class was 40 people, 50, and was two Jewish people, you know. And was living in different place, like we -- and we not have close connection. And still we seem the same, Polish citizen, has the same right like we Catholic, Protestant or Muslim, because was couple Muslim too.
  </p>
  <p id="139">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="140">
   A: We have the same -- and I feel this -- I was raise in the same feeling, who because you must know and I am sure you know, the Polish Constitution was the second in the world after American Constitution, and it is the same Constitution, freedom from everyth -- everybody.
  </p>
  <p id="141">
   Q: Did -- wh-when you were growing up in Poland as a kid, before the war, did you experience people expressing anti-Semitism? Did you -- did you understand that there was a difference?
  </p>
  <p id="142">
   A: You know si -- you know si -- this 1s big word.
  </p>
  <p id="143">
   Q: Yes, I understand.
  </p>
  <p id="144">
   A: A big word, a big question.
  </p>
  <p id="145">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="146">
   A: I live -- I born there, and my race 1s this time there. And the feeling was not anti-Semitic so much -- some people, yes. Like the J-Jewish people has m-more educated in this time -- part -- part, not all, because if we talking about the Jewish, we must divide -- and the problem is, we must divide between -- up to bucar -- Vistula river west, and Vistula river east. Vistula river west was not big su -- problem. West -- excuse me, east, was mostly people very sympatic to Communist regime. Socialist Communist regime. On the west part of the Poland, I mean, from the Vistula river, was little differ -- different and was from German idea anti-Semitic, and was not catch all of nation. Was only ma -- some small part. On east Poland was very big, torrential Communist ideology. And I lose my --
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   Q: Well, I think what I -- what I was asking you is, given th -- when -- when people live separately, and in many societies they do this, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="148">
   A: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="149">
   Q: So that children are often raised to think --
  </p>
  <p id="150">
   A: Oh, excuse me, that’s I -- I not feel --
  </p>
  <p id="151">
   Q: Yes, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="152">
   A: -- now you remind me. Mostly was a economical problem. And that’s -- if we call this anti- Semitism, that’s wrong. That’s was economical. Jewish people was hardworking, s-stood close together and was the same token, more successful. And Po -- Polish people, specially on -- on the east, was more lazy, like all the Russian this time. Not produce so much, not educated so much. And start the different between Jewish more educated and -- and born on the east part of the Poland, more lazy and more -- not created. So -- and that’s was all time the different economical. Not only anti-Semitic -- I understand, because you are Jewish, you are no good. You are a Polish- Polish, you are good -- you are good. And question is, economical -- the answer is economical base. That’s if somebody called the anti-Semitism, that’s not right. I not feel this way. Was some people was, from the point of view. This is -- Jewish mean this fellow is different like we are, because the fellow has [indecipherable] the fellow has the factory, the fellow working hard. And ss -- that’s not ss -- for me it’s not ss -- right. What I understand before the war, that’s was only different on eco -- economical base, not religion.
  </p>
  <p id="153">
   Q: So you don’t think that there was some kind of difference based on the fact that Jews believed differently than Catholics or Protestants?
  </p>
  <p id="154">
   A: No, I don’t think so, I don’t think so. I -- Ia -- race, you know, but to different people -- in my class, for example, was many -- not many, couple, Protestants. Nobody never talk about [indecipherable] feel this way, I feel other way. Generally speaking, like I said before, this was economical base in Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="155">
   Q: Okay, so let me ask you something. When Hitler comes to power in 1933 --
  </p>
  <p id="156">
   A: Yes?
  </p>
  <p id="157">
   Q: -- between °33 and °39, before the war --
  </p>
  <p id="158">

  </p>
  <p id="159">
   Q: -- there is a rise of Fascism, or the right in Poland as well. Am -- am I not correct? There was
  </p>
  <p id="160">
   A: Before the war, was -- for me was not so popular start argument and fighting with the Jewish people, it was not popular. Some part of student in university created some, we are against the Jews who are educated in our university, because Jewish are 10 percent of the population, and in our class are 40 percent the Jewish people, educated by state. That’s economical [indecipherable]. And all some student who said Jewish in our class supposed to be 10 percent, not 40 percent. And now you can call how you like, Anti-Semitist, or economical [indecipherable]. You see, that’s the very big question.
  </p>
  <p id="161">
   Q: Do you think that the numerous clauses that was put into effect, the numerous clauses, which didn’t allow as many Jewish students as before was a function of economics?
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   A: Economical --
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   A: -- because some poor guys -- as -- very smart, cannot go to university because there was already, for example, 40 percent Jewish people. And this guy was [indecipherable] not me? Why I cannot go there? You see, that’s the story. You must look both ways. And still I have very big respect for -- this time, for Jewish parents, try and pay for education own children. That’s I mention [indecipherable] we must look after Jewish people. And take the sample, educate it own people. And this time, in Poland, many people not think this way. And Jewish people was ahead, educated own children. That’s the very important.
  </p>
  <p id="165">
   Q: So let me ask you something. So when you’re -- when Hitler comes to power in Germany --
  </p>
  <p id="166">

  </p>
  <p id="176">
   A: And we know, and each as -- from us, especially young people like me was thinking, we supposed to be the people who are honest, and people who are fair for everybody. He -- old people thinking, no, we are looking a little bit for right side. I was more liberal, after I grow up and I know a little bit more, I was little bit more towards center. And Hitler was created, you know, the situation, people start talking about the Jewish problem, and it’s a -- etcetera. And not many people supported this idea, what I know.
  </p>
  <p id="177">
   Q: Mm-hm. Right.
  </p>
  <p id="178">
   A: Some crazy guy at left or right, that’s was not my idea. I try balance in my life opinion. And still Hitler did the worst part what happened to Jewish people, Polish people and other people who was lost life in concentration camp and death camp. That’s what happened right now, and I not see in the newspaper in America right now mention how many people die, how they this or this. And now the German raise like big nation and -- and are successful, and our people in America, in Poland, are depress. That’s my feeling. That’s my [indecipherable]

  <p id="204">
   A: No, afraid you sa -- afraid, that’s one thing. If you are young people s-soldiers -- soldier, I was in this time soldier, you are all time afraid, because you know German was equipped with better 1 -- equipment, better trained and so and so, and Poland was less equipped. And so [indecipherable] knows. And that’s war. And specially if you talking about the war, really not war, from east after the agreement between Hitler and Stalin, and take France and start -- give our back knife in the other back, that’s different story and start [indecipherable] there, and KGB and so and so.

   A: You know.
  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: And what made you decide to bribe the germa -- the --
  </p>
  <p id="263">
   A: Because I -- before -- because I read three newspaper, I know what mean the Communist who are -- Communist in the book is very nice. Practically bur -- talking, the east part, this 1s Asian people, and all time talking differently, doing differently, and you never know what happen. That’s -- I was scared. And people who was with me in the same company, know is only right now chance, take our dresses and insignia what was -- because the rifle was already gone, because was taken by Russian, and escape. We know about, we must do this. We was prepare mentally. There is not good. There 1 -- west is not good, east is no good. We must survive. That, you know, I give him watch, a -- this time for Soviet, have the watch, that’s was drim. And I have 20 dollar -- 20 zloty, was nice m-money, because p -- my parents give me before I go there. And we escape, was six people. Six people and two go north, to Litvah, and two go -- we go to Warsaw, and two go to east. And this go t -- well, go to east probably, I never heard about it, or probably was killed or something. Two go -- go north, because this part was close to Vilnos, couple hundred kilometer from Warsaw. And these two guys, one of the was very famous general in Poland, son, go to Litvah and later they fight in English -- go through the Litvah to [indecipherable] Estonia, and go to Sweden, and later there fight like officer in Navy -- British Navy. And three -- two guys walk from there through the forest and etcetera, to Warsaw. And the way -- like we walk was not so easy, because you must know, between German and Lithuanian was something close, mean German talk to Lithuanian nationalist who work later, therefore German like not Gestapo, only military unit, and was against the Poland. Very against the Poland. Small country, very against the Poland. And after Soviet destroyed our army from east, these people, Lithuanian -- not all, and mostly, was very upset about the Polish army. And I myso -- we must walked -- walk to Warsaw during night because on the -- 1n the forest, I saw myself, many officer hanging, by Lithuanian. And without the boots, you know. In other words, we was scared. That’s was scare. Because you never know where you go. We cannot go through the village, because [indecipherable] scared of the village was checkpoint, checkpoint created by Polish Communists, and check you everything, and you know, you never know, you can go to -- later they arrest and go to Siberia. And between these people with a red band, was many Polish poor guy who was created, who was Communist and maybe Jewish people, poor Jewish people too, who think [indecipherable] new area, you -- a new life because everybody be free. Fine, be free, only not raise up to free, mean to middle class. Only turn down -- everybody down. And the people was thinking that the right way, and was wrong. And to me going back, we -- to Warsaw, we must be careful where we are going.

  <p id="269">
   A: We try e -- this area was some people who are Polish citizen and the same token not only Polish citizen, was Polish characters. In other words, if we knock down -- knock to the door, and we -- the people see we are in uniform, give us sleep, give us something to eat, was not much, and -- little bit. And give us address where we supposed to go --
  </p>
  <p id="270">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="271">
   A: -- and meet other guy help us. That’s was the reason we were very slow from September to end of de -- December, we walk 700 kilometers by foot. And before we cross borderline on the river Bug, some big river, we was waiting when we can cross there, because there was German and here was the bol -- the Soviet. And we was almost two weeks waiting on the -- close to the river Bug, and we was working for farmers. Farmers this time was -- Polish farmer pick up the potato. And we pick up the potato, and I never did this job. I was terrible had, because you know, was very hard to do this, all the time in this position.

   A: That’s happen.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: I -- I’m going to start going sort of back and -- back and forth with different -- different things, because your experience covers both the Polish Catholic or Polish Christian side as well as In some ways what happened to Jews. When the ghetto was announced --
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: Yes, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   Q: -- for Jews in October 1940, and then the Jews move into the ghetto area, do you --

  <p id="689">
   A: -- that [indecipherable] right, and -- and --

  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: Oh yeah, sure, absolutely, absolutely, I remember this how you know they was very upset, see the people you know, all -- all the house, and you know, [indecipherable] house, and taking to other small places and so and so and vice versa. That’s was not good for Christian [indecipherable] ghetto, must move other ways, because all time be losing proposition, because if you stay, you know, where everything is, you are satisfied, 1f you must move you lose all contact.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: But did you see it as more dangerous for the Jews moving into the ghetto, given this --
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: Oh sure, absolutely, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

  </p>
  <p id="706">
   Q: But you remember seeing it being built?
  </p>
  <p id="707">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="708">
   Q: Th-The wall. And did you wonder why, if they put the Jews 1 --
  </p>
  <p id="709">
   A: No, we know wh --
  </p>
  <p id="710">
   Q: You knew.
  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: -- why. We know this is for insulation the Jewish people from [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="712">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="713">
   A: And we know, and we know the next be Polish people. Maybe not this way, other way, and be very danger from German part of [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="714">
   Q: In the underground, was there a discussion about what this would mean for the Jews --
  </p>
  <p id="715">
   A: Oh sure, and --
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: -- an-and what, if anything, should be done?
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: Anything, that’s -- that’s very, very difficult question.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: Yes, I --
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: Talk about what can be done.
  </p>
  <p id="720">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: And what -- if you suggest we do something like this, and you don’t know, you must think how many people lose the life doing this. Sometime was not possible.
  </p>
  <p id="722">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="723">
   A: And doing something for Jewish people in this time was -- many think not possible because was army -- army people working for this idea, Hitler idea, put the Jews there. For example, some -- we -- and we have not power for this, our organization I know -- not my unit, si -- in our organization help Jewish people who stop uprising. And was too late. And beside this, some people here to gi -- why you no-not give the arms to Jewish people in ghetto. Warsaw uprising was lose because was not enough guns, not enough ammunition, not enough nothing. In other words, give Akar, Armia Krajowa prepare a-and train Jewish people during the ar -- wa -- Jury -- Jewish uprising and help was not possible. Was really not -- I help, I bring the sandwiches there each day or so -- or something, and that’s nothing. There was half million people.
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="725">
   A: And you know, Polish underground men go to -- through the all borders from Germany to Hispania and later there to Anglia, and Mr. Karski, you know --
  </p>
  <p id="726">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="727">
   A: -- that the name, go there and talk to [indecipherable] talk later there to -- to the President Roosevelt. And the people not believe first, and second, between us, Jewish people not help much. New York Jewish people not help much Jewish people in Warsaw, because was not -- not believe can happen to people like this.
  </p>
  <p id="728">
   Q: Did you know of Jan Karski’s work during the war, or did you only find out about it after?
  </p>
  <p id="729">
   A: No during the war, I know after the war.
  </p>
  <p id="730">
   Q: That he was a --
  </p>
  <p id="731">
   A: And I know him personally.
  </p>
  <p id="732">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="733">
   A: I know him personally. A very nice, you know, brave man and etcetera. And during this war, underground army cannot do mu -- much more.
  </p>
  <p id="734">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="735">
   A: Because was each -- we must be careful with the underground, also many German people live in Poland [speaks Polish here] was spy for Germany. And you must be very close -- if we talk together we go outside, not inside because maybe is something not --
  </p>
  <p id="736">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="737">
   A: -- connect some instrument and that was not so easy. Now, every pa -- body criticize. For example, Jewish people suggest the railroad tracks in Poland to Auschwitz supposed to be -- supposed to be bombard by alliance. Never happened.
  </p>
  <p id="738">
   Q: You mean by Americans?
  </p>
  <p id="739">
   A: By -- right. By American or a -- or a -- English. Never happened. You see, because this was calculated risk, is not make sense, we must win the war. Meantime, you win the war, and how many Jewish or Polish live -- lost your life?
  </p>
  <p id="740">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="741">
   A: You know that’s politics -- and -- and besides this, you must know one thing. After war -- after Germany take Poland and Russian take first all guns, all radio, all instrument against the enemy, and in Poland was not -- you cannot buy gun, you cannot have some ammunition, because everything German took out. And later there, before start the Warsaw uprising, how you can have the guns? Buy from the German who are against the war happen, or kill the German and take the ha -- gun. Was not so easy.
  </p>
  <p id="742">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="743">
   A: Because if you kill one German, a hundred people was hanged tomorrow or -- or shot tomorrow. That’s very -- very touchy moment.
  </p>
  <p id="744">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="745">
   A: That’s not so easy, because somebody special, who never know in conspiracy, and never know the organization Armia Krajowa think we supposed to do more, or why you not do this, how you not -- that’s was everything calculated, you know. If you do something good for one person and lost two person home, that’s not make sense. And etcetera. And I am a little bit upset maybe, cause Karski was in the west, and not help -- help, and not support ne -- from American government and from Jewish government -- for Jewish, I am not [indecipherable], 1n Jewish. And that’s was for me big question, why. I understand for example, the New York Jewish organization cannot give the guns, cannot give ammunition, and can’t give the money -- money, and for money, American money, you can buy in Poland this time, everything. And that’s my point, the personal point view.
  </p>
  <p id="746">
   Q: Right
  </p>
  <p id="747">
   A: I not represent, you know, some organization.
  </p>
  <p id="748">
   Q: Right, I understand.
  </p>
  <p id="749">
   A: And that’s my personal view.
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="751">
   A: And I know these people can help little bit more own people. That’s my feeling.
  </p>
  <p id="752">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="753">
   A: Because we Polish people cannot -- Catholic people, we cannot think somebody can help us. Only English, French supposed to have some sign, agreement supposed to help Poland, but it never did, and forgot Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="754">
   Q: We’re going to take a break because we have to change the tape.

  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: -- because if somebody die on the street, the other people take the clothes and sell or something like this. It was very, very upset situation. I told you before, the living situation in ghetto was worse like 1n co -- in concentration camp.
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: So did you think that the Nazis -- the Germans were in some ways killing the Jews? Without - without sent -- bef -- this is before they’re sending them to Treblinka, by starving them to death?
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   A: Oh, sure, the German can shoot anybody on street, without a problem, and special in ghetto. And not many German was in ghetto.

  <p id="829">
   A: Not many Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   A: Only was on the gates and secure the whole town wall to ghetto. And inside, I think, was pro- probably -- I never saw, was some Gestapo who give the order to Judenrat, you do this, you do this, you produce this, you give me some goods or something like this. And mostly the German ask Judenrat and press -- give couple thousand people daily, daily, for work in east. That’s was idea. After couple months -- couple weeks, the Polish underground organization check where the people are going on the east, and start know that’s was Treblinka, a-and Sobibor -- Sobibor, and the other camp where the people was killed by gas, and later there cra -- cremated. And -- and the last time I remember the Jewish rat was obligated -- mean Jewish rat and -- Jewish police supposed to deliver 10,000 people daily. And this go to Umschlagplatz. From Umschlagplatz was sent to concen -- to death camp, not concentration camp, death camp.
  </p>
  <p id="832">

  </p>

  <p id="840">
   Q: And -- and children?
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   A: Each -- each time I was there, all time was not not one, hundred people dead or dying. And you know, the people who die on the street, Judenrat organ -- organize the -- some transport. Two wheels and platform and two guys, or three guys take the s-street the dad -- dead body and put later there to the Umschlagplatz. Because to Umschlagplatz people know more like I know, I understand if was coo -- supposed to be deliver 10,000 people for example, the police take the dead people too, means hundred dead, plus 9,900 people. In other words, the transport com- commander inside the ghetto take the dead body and deliver someplace. I don’t know, I know it’s not there. And you cannot see hundred people -- thousand people right -- right ya -- one day on the street, because each day, or all time continue, was clean the street, by the dead body. Still, I saw not one, not two, hundred people dying or dead on the street. Was terrible situation, terrible. That’s was hunger, people have nothing to eat. Live very bad condition and nobody can help.

   A: Very depressing. And the -- and the -- from this time, I was little bit not sure, and many Polish poor people, and young, deliver to ghetto food, b-back of a ka -- kartofel mean the potato or something others. And work was the Jewish people on the other side, some way, or you saw some hole in the wall, maybe foot by 18 inches. The children go through. Children go through -- go to Aryan place, and beg or make business, these small guys. Bring the money and buy some -- something, I don’t know what kind food. Buy something and later right through the hole, deliver there. And many people -- many time happened the gendarmes was over there and ki -- killed the guy, young child. And we was popular in Poland -- Warsaw, in Aryan area where the young children doing something, buying or -- or begging for food. Mean, even, ghetto was terrible, terrible situation.
