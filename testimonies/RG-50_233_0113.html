  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Money.
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Because back home if you made for a customer something, you take this coat or suit or something to the customer’s home in a big box. Then he went before Shabbos, Friday, then he got a tip. He goes later, nobody gives him money any more. But he brought some tips so I liked that. So I said to myself, I’m going to be a tailor. Again also.
  </p>
  <p id="96">
   Q: That’s when you decided?
  </p>
  <p id="97">
   A: Huh?
  </p>
  <p id="98">
   Q: That’s when you decided. So you stopped going to school and then you apprenticed?
  </p>
  <p id="99">
   A: Yeah. I went -- my father and mother -- they didn’t go with me to an apprentice like with my brother. I went by myself always. I always was by myself.
  </p>
  <p id="100">
   Q: Did your parents have other plans for you?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: Huh?

  <p id="102">
   Q: Did they have other plans?
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: So they were happy that you two were going to --?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: Before, I helped a little bit so when my father manufactured shoes, I helped a little bit home, to help my father. Then I went by myself to an apprentice, to a ladies’ tailor. And I went to this ladies’ tailor, you know an apprentice, you have to clean the floor, you have to go shopping with them. When they have a kid, you have to raise the kid. It wasn’t so easy. So I would stay for a while and then I said it’s not for me. I cannot learn too much because I have to do other housework. So I looked for somebody else. I looked for somebody else and I did find Yanka Fishman, a ladies’ tailor. This was my in-law.
  </p>
  <p id="106">
   Q: Future father-in-law?

  </p>
  <p id="121">

  </p>
  <p id="143">
   A: Not I have a place to be there. Because was Hameecha, my friend and we met...She came down there, we talked, nothing happened. So later on I said to myself, Yanka Fishman got a son. He worked for his father. Hameecha, you know, my friend, the cousin, the uncle, he worked there too and I’m a stranger there. I didn’t learn too much. I didn’t learn too much so one day I went to Yanka Fishman and I said, Mr. Fishman, I cannot stay here. He said, why? I said because I don’t learn too much. The son and you, Hameecha there and I’m the last one.

We have our cards from the shop that we are meisters. You don’t have to show them that. Forget it. They don’t need any cards. They only looked at your face. They looked at your face and then you go right or left. Right is good or left 1s good, we didn’t know. So we saw --we was staying together, the bunch without wives and kids. We saw which SS man he let through more people. So we went to his row. The cars with the meister doesn’t mean a thing. They looked at your face, go. So we went.

We staying in this factory. Before we come in, piles of people on the floor dead. We stay there till the light comes, daylight. From this people, they always came and they took out people, even from here. Why -because they took them to the streets to clean up the dead. Because the street was full of deads. They have to bury them. Open up ditches and put them in. They didn’t took us because we were the last ones over there. When the light comes on, we start marching. Where we marched, we didn’t know. When we march, on the left side was a bunch of SS. Between the SS was also and the name Shippes maybe you heard somebody, no. Shippes, he was the top. Sam and _ Fishman, an uncle of mine, they were in front. When we passed by the SS, Shippes saidtoS — you____ for him, he made the uniforms.

If a customer comes in and they need a tailor, a meister to come down to take the measurement, to take the material, wasa___—, a boy, a young boy. He was running up and down ,up and down. Runs up, number 21, down. I come down, a customer’s there, have to take the measurement. The main thing what I did. She has a package with material she brought. I opened the package like this and I knew already how many yards. Why -- because if I can cut off a piece, I don’t need the material. Because they got the material. They didn’t - _. In Jewish --. When I saw, I have enough material, I can cut off a sk , you know. So I knew that this is going to be -- can go to the Polaks and give them the piece of sk and take some food home.

Why -- because I have to cut a suit, a coat and the piece I go to the Polaks right away and I have something to eat. She was happy. We went in booths for fittings. Was a lot of booths, you know, for the customer. Where there was a empty booth, I went in. Sometimes they brought something. Bread or something.

Dress, when there’s something wrong, we know we’re going into sewing, we’re going to fix it ourselves. So we were given a barrack where we should live. We come into the barrack, I always took -- there was three beds. I always took the top.

  <p id="801">
   Q: Any particular reason for this?

I didn’t recognize her. She looked so terrible, without hair, with a thing on the head, a cover. She looked terrible. I said to her don’t worry. I’m going to try to give her a place where to stay in the barrack. I tried when we make the dresses. I tried to give her a dress. I tried to see that she should have something to eat. I cannot go home to the barracks yet. So when the day was finished, I met her. We talked and she told me what happened. The kid, she -- first of all, she told me -- my brother got typhus.

   Q: Yes, with your sister-in-law and your friends.
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   A: Yeah, we’re all together. Then the same thing happened. A transport arrived from Buzim. You heard of Buzim?
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   Q: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   A: When the transport arrived from Buzim, everything changed. With them came a lot of kapos. Not only Jewish kapos, other nationalities, kapos.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   Q: Polish, Ukrainian?
  </p>
  <p id="840">
   A: Yeah. Because they liquidated Majdanek. They were sent here to our place. When the Buzim arrived, start stealing. The Buzim, they were our people but ---.
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   Q: Thieves?
  </p>
  <p id="842">
   A: I don’t know if they were thieves, they were butchers and all kind of people. Listen to this; I was sleeping one night on top of the barrack and I had a hand is crawling under mine -- like pillow. Of course, you know, if you’re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or something. On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling. I got sewed in there diamond. The rest was in the shop. So when I heard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking what to do. I was thinking I’m going to get up first and catch him. I got up first and I start screaming and I caught an undershirt. He was pulling away a black undershirt. I have the piece from the undershirt in my hand and he’s gone.
  </p>
  <p id="843">
   Q: You didn’t know who he was?
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   A: No. I did find out.
  </p>
  <p id="845">
   Q: From Buzim?
  </p>
  <p id="846">
   A: Yeah. I start screaming and everybody on the lower beds, everybody catch each other. He was coming out from the barrack already. We was still looking for him. I have the place from the shirt. If you go around, where there’s an empty bed, maybe he run out from the barrack or something, but no empty bed.
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   Q: How did you find out who he was?
  </p>
  <p id="848">
   A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diamond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more on top. Was on the floor. So next day I went to Friedman, to Fishman, and they went to the Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid. When we went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said, that the kapos arrived, so forget about it. They’re going to liquidate us. That was not true. The kapos was still there. I didn’t know who took it. We still were there. Then one day, they’re going to liquidate the Skolna. No more Jews in Radom. So one day everybody has to go marching. We went marching. There was no trains, we marched by foot. We didn’t know where we going. We marched by day. At night they let us go in a tent (?) to lay down, to sleep. Some people, they couldn’t walk any more. If they know what happen, they would walk. A car- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us. The SS said who cannot walk any more 1s tired, should go on the wagon. Near me was Mr. G , a little bit older than me and Mrs. Zucker. Her husband got killed on the sch when I told you was a fire, sabotage. They killed her husband and other people. They went on the wagon. When the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared. Then he came back, empty. Some other people, next time, they still went on the wagon. But later on, we saw something is not kosher. The second time, the wagon disappeared. The third time, nobody went on the wagon any more. Because we was sleeping on the field and then one day they said water arrived to give us, to drink water. It was so a mess that they start shooting. They shoot the people in the lakes. A lot of people. Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the legs. They didn’t go on the wagon any more. But the last night, they were sleeping on the field before we went into Tomaszow- . It was a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I think. Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons. Sinnas. When we were sleeping on the field, they took off the corn already from the field. You know, was — the ground was soaked.
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   Q: Wet?
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   A: They digged. They start digging. They digged a hole in the ground. They were prepared for it. They digged a hole in the ground and the two Sinnas, the two brothers when they saw that it’s going to be light already, we have to march again, they got in there and the daughter, the sister and this wife, they covered up.
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   Q: So two brothers buried themselves?
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   A: Yeah, they covered them up with dirt. They covered them up with dirt and they got paper to put on the face and they got from bottles, the neck, the neck from the bottles to give them in the mouth.
  </p>
  <p id="853">
   Q: To breathe?

  </p>
  <p id="1060">

  </p>
  <p id="1061">
   Q: So you didn’t know that the Germans were losing?
  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   A: We talked. We saw the bombing. You see when we went out cleaning the tracks where they bombed and everything. We saw the English with the round marks, the bombing and the SS they were running like hell. We even looked up like a song. Didn’t bother us. Then when they bombed Stuggardt. We saw in Vaihingen, in the SS, they were running. So we stayed outside and looking. We saw the way they throw down the lights. The lights come before, then the bombing. Was like a Christmas trees, the top. For us was perfect, but the SS they were afraid.
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   Q: But did you suspect that maybe Germany was going to lose the war?
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   A: Yeah, we talked, you know, everybody talked a different language.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   Q: Soon maybe. Did you think maybe the Americans were coming?
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   A: No, no. This was a dream. We not going to survive anyway. I’m still back in Vaihingen and I still go up to Agelzay.
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   Q: And you’re a tailor?
  </p>
  <p id="1068">
   A: Yeah. All of a sudden, I didn’t feel good. But I didn’t give in. Temperature went high but I didn’t give in. I knew when I was going to go to the barrack and you knew the only thing what happened to you is typhus.
  </p>
  <p id="1069">
   Q: You had typhus?
  </p>
  <p id="1070">
   A: And typhus is dead. I didn’t give in. Then when I worked, I went home in the barrack. I picked up my shirt here all red. My belly was all red, spots, red spots. I knew it’s typhus. I still went to work because if I go into the barrack, I’m dead. But it took a while, I couldn’t work any more. They carried me in their arm so I have to go in. So I went into Moishe Goldberg’s barrack. Moishe Goldberg also was a friend of mine.
  </p>
  <p id="1071">
   Q: Radomer?
  </p>
  <p id="1072">
   A: Radoman, no friend. Was Usha Goldberg and Moishe Goldberg. Usha Goldberg was top echelon, he was a policeman, he was everything. I go into this barrack holding my shoes like this. The main thing, the shoes.
  </p>
  <p id="1073">
   Q: You still have the photos?
  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   A: Right, in the shop. I’m waiting under the door because was no room. I have to wait until somebody dies. When he’s out, they throw me in bed. so help me God. I went in and the guy was laying in bed still. Was still alive. This guy has diarrhea.
  </p>
  <p id="1075">
   Q: Right in the bed?
  </p>
  <p id="1076">
   A: In the bed, yeah. He was still alive. They pulled him out by the legs. Like I see it now. You know what they did with me? They throw me in.
  </p>
  <p id="1077">
   Q: Right in?
  </p>
  <p id="1078">
   A: In the mess. I say to myself, that’s it. If] would drop dead, I wouldn’t mind but I always was conscious of to be clean. Here I lay in a mess, somebody else’s mess. Not on top, on the bottom. Then I start looking for help. Moishe Goldberg cannot talk. He got a . He took care of the room. Was also a Radoman, Friedman. I didn’t know him too good. Later I got to be a friend of his. I start calling. Friedman, if you can give me a sack with straw, you know, and take this away. He didn’t listen. I said, was his name. Also Friedom, like the policeman. I have some dollars, I give you some dollars. He felt, he said okay. I’m going to put on you -- mattress. Mattress huh -- straw on top. I said, this would be fine. I paid him. Money can buy everything. Then I was laying and the crisis arrived. I was laying again in water, top.
  </p>
  <p id="1079">
   Q: Somebody’s ---?
  </p>
  <p id="1080">
   A: From myself, no. This water comes from myself. When you have the crisis, you start perspiring.
  </p>
  <p id="1081">
   Q: The fever’s high?
  </p>
  <p id="1082">
   A: Yeah, high and then you perspire. When you survive this perspiring, you’re okay. One day I lay again in water from myself. I felt the crisis went over and I’m still alive. After that typhus, you need to eat. Let’s say when they give you my whole Frigidaire with another grocery store, not enough. I don’t know where it goes but you can eat so much, it’s unbelievable.
  </p>
  <p id="1083">
   Q: Where are you going to get the food?
  </p>
  <p id="1084">
   A: I called to Laza Malamit -- message. They cannot come in here. They can send me a piece of bread or something like this. They did, they did. Then they did find somebody by the name of Firdik. He went outside the walls. He brought in always food. I said to -- let him bring me marmalade if it possible and an onion. Because you get scurvy, you know what means scurvot?
  </p>
  <p id="1085">
   A: Scurvy?
  </p>
  <p id="1086">
   A: Scurvot means you don’t have the vitamins or lemon or --.
  </p>
  <p id="1087">
   Q: Yeah, scurvy. Your gums get -- your teeth fall out. Scurvy.
  </p>
  <p id="1088">
   A: A lot of people died of this. I said I need a -- he can bring me. I give him a ten dollar bill if he can bring me marmalade, onion and a bread. He did. So the jar of marmalade was under the pillow. Lice, a lot, who cares. You eat the lice. I put in my hand always in the jar and licked it the marmalade. I got the onion to eat. No, I got the bread because the bread I have to hold with me. I’m laying like this, still hungry. In the same barrack, across the street, he was a Swiss or other nation, he got Red Cross packages.
  </p>
  <p id="1089">
   Q: He’s not Jewish?
  </p>
  <p id="1090">
   A: No, not Jewish. When I looked at him, the way he was eating the package -- chocolate and all kinds of things. Oh, I cannot go down from bed. Maybe I would steal from him, I don’t know. Then I was thinking to myself. Why he can get a package from the Red Cross and I couldn’t get it. Unless he -- you know the question.
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   Q: Yes. You’re asking the question now. Could you ask the question then?
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   A: No. To whom am I going to ask a question?
  </p>
  <p id="1093">
   A: And you couldn’t talk to him? You couldn’t buy anything from him? You were too far away?
  </p>
  <p id="1094">
   A: No, no. Then I said to myself. After the war, if I’m going to survive, no Red Cross for me. I’m going to hate them always and I’m not going to donate a penny to the Red Cross any more. The Jewish donating money to the Red Cross. I wouldn’t. If they can give a package to him, why not to me? Nobody would know. So I’m laying here hungry, don’t know what’s going on outside. All of a sudden, some people, Meyer Pasternak, a lot of people, they run into the barrack, to my barrack! They not allowed to go in. It’s dangerous. They’re hiding. They’re hiding 1n this barrack.
  </p>
  <p id="1095">
   Q: Why?
  </p>
  <p id="1096">
   A: Underneath the beds, on the ceiling. You can open -- go under the roof. Because they liquidate Vaihingen.
  </p>
  <p id="1097">
   Q: So they’re afraid?
  </p>
  <p id="1098">
   A: They took the people from Vaihingen to Dachau. Laza Malamit went, Moishe Krol went, Meyer Pasternak, he’s in Florida. He’s a smart cookie, he didn’t go. He was hiding. Then the SS did find out. They came with guns and they shoot in the barrack. I don’t know how many people got killed or what. I was laying covered up on my place.
  </p>
  <p id="1099">
   Q: So they shot right there in front of you? You could see it?
  </p>
  <p id="1100">
   A: Yeah, in the barrack. In the ceiling, underneath, everywhere. Because they knew they were hiding. But still a lot of people were hiding. Next day, in the morning, just next day, people come in and they brought me white bread. White bread, all kind of things! I said what happened? The French army passed. He said, we are liberated.
  </p>
  <p id="1101">

  <p id="1114">
   A: Near the end, yes. He told me -- it was a special -- was F and . They took the dead people in the back. Over there was an open pit, they throw him in. He told me he took Rafilovich out there.

  </p>
  <p id="1116">
   A: A short time I was liberated before.
  </p>
  <p id="1117">
   Q: Just before?
  </p>
  <p id="1118">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1119">
   Q: And you didn’t see him in sick barrack? When you were in the sick barrack he was already --?
  </p>
  <p id="1120">
   A: No, I didn’t see him any more. Because I was with typhus.
  </p>
  <p id="1121">
   Q: But I mean he had the lung disease. They didn’t put him in the sick bay? Moishe, they didn’t put Moishe in the sick barrack?
  </p>
  <p id="1122">
   A: In the sick barrack, no. He died in the regular barrack. This barrack was only for contaminated people, typhus. So when I got this bread and they told me we are liberated, I said to myself, I’m not going to lay in bed. I start crawling from bed down out to the field. The wire was cut already, the people cut the wire and I was crawling on the field where the trucks passed, the French army. They saw me, they stopped the truck and they came down and they brought me a lot of stuff, packages and chocolate and bread and everything. I’m laying here with all the stuff, I cannot carry.
  </p>
  <p id="1123">
   Q: And you smelled?
  </p>
  <p id="1124">
   A: But somebody helped me to take in to the barrack. I went into the barrack and I said why am I sitting in this barrack already? I went out in the camp. It took maybe another hour, we still didn’t get out. We are afraid to get out. The French army came in. The French army came in and they start putting DDT on everybody. The army never bathed because they were afraid to go in. They put the powder over you, all over the place. The French people start looking around and they went in the back and they saw how many people laying in this ditch with the striped suits, a lot. They think hundreds and hundreds. Then they called the mayor from Vaihingen, the mayor or somebody and the people come over. They should look what they did. One French soldier, a Jewish, I think he was Jewish, he gives me a gun. When he gives me a gun, I kill him (?) The people who come to work. They brought people to work, to bury the people. I never got a gun in my hand I says and I cannot kill nobody. He looks at me stupid. So we were staying in this barrack and they caught the SS. Hechay, the two guys in the kitchen plus Machine and Bill. There what they did, their job, they cooked. They worked with the people with the Jewish people. They were the top Jewish people cooking. They went home, we were staying on that field to count us. They went through you, like this, and hit here in the testicles. A lot of people they were no men any more. What they went through, they hate you all the time. Even you were hiding, holding like this, they caught them. They caught almost all the SS except Miller the . One was there, a Wehrmacht, the , we called him. He worked also with them but he was not doing too much damage. The Hoffman.
  </p>
  <p id="1125">
   Q: So you’re like a witness?
  </p>
  <p id="1126">
   A: Yeah. Then it was a trial.
  </p>
  <p id="1127">
   Q: Right there in Vaihingen?

He was the best donaschneider in Radom, don’t touch him, leave him alone. They didn’t touch me so I got this bicycle. I went into the barrack with the bicycle. Then when we went into this place, this town what the French army give us -- over there we got everything. On top of this, they brought nurses from Paris to treat us. They made us healthy. They ordered the town, should bring every day meat, bread and milk for the people here. We got so much that from other camps, everybody did find out.
