  </p>
  <p id="828">
   Q: From the rents?
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   A: From the rents. And I counted it out, and I marked it exactly as it was. And so, the men did that too. And later on I found out that was a man from the good side, so anyhow — so — and so I was there. In the meantime, an girl mind the store, when Jacqueline was home —

   A: — the — one of the employees she worked with, saw that, that I was picked up, and went up her bicycle — that was in Rotterdam, went to Schiedam, went to wherever. And then Jacqueline went to the — a friend of ours who was underground, and worked for the Germans. And — and so they made an false C- card, and signed. And when they found out that I had a C-card, then that evening, I was left free. So, I got the money ready in my pocket, all counted out, all the papers what I had, and [indecipherable]. And I went home, and I went with the last trolley car, I went home, and they were all waiting in the — with other neighbors in — they said, well then, it’s the last trolley, let’s see if Jan is in there. And so I was, of course, he’s walking, I was running.

  </p>
  <p id="846">
   A: Yeah, there was another time that I — I had to go, but that was before we were married.
  </p>
  <p id="847">
   Q: And did you go?
  </p>
  <p id="848">
   A: And — no.
  </p>
  <p id="849">
   Q: How did you get out of that one?
  </p>
  <p id="850">
   A: Well, we were — I think Jacqueline told you that we were married, and the next day, she was sick.
  </p>
  <p id="851">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   A: And that so, her mother called the doctor, and she said — and he looked at her, and he said, she has typhus.
  </p>
  <p id="853">
   Q: Ah, she has typhus.
  </p>
  <p id="854">
   A: Typhus.
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="856">
   A: And he said, well — and then her mother said, well, they were together, so that may be he has it too. So he wrote a note that she had typhus, and I had maybe it too. August 9, 2016 And I went to the office [indecipherable] to go out, to extend it. And I had — they had given me five guilders, you know, for going, for if I went to Germany to —
  </p>
  <p id="857">
   Q: For the trip.
  </p>
  <p id="858">
   A: — for — for the trip. And that was with an train for the — for the Germans. And so — but they said, no, keep the money, so I kept the five dol — five guilders and went home. And of course, from there — and that was to the end in ’44, was for the end.
  </p>
  <p id="859">
   Q: Okay, so that was when you got married in ’43, and then the end of ’44 was the second time.
  </p>
  <p id="860">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="861">
   Q: Okay. And did she have typhus, or did the doctor just say so?
  </p>
  <p id="862">
   A: No, she not either.
  </p>
  <p id="863">
   Q: Okay, okay. So it was a way to help you from not getting there.
  </p>
  <p id="864">
   A: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="865">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="866">
   A: That’s how the doctor was on our side.
  </p>
  <p id="867">
   Q: Do you remember when the war ended?
  </p>
  <p id="868">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="869">
   Q: What was that like? August 9, 2016
  </p>
  <p id="870">
   A: Well, of course we — it were — the sirens were on no end, and while we lived at the front of the building, there were two towers, and each tower was a flag post. And you could climb the rope [indecipherable] water on the side, and put a flag over. There was never a flag over on there, the Germans didn’t want that, of course. But then I went the rope, on the tower, and the fi — th — I saw the planes go over from the — from — A2: From England.
  </p>
  <p id="871">
   A: No, not England, the north. Denmark — was Sweden. Sweden flew over with — with planes and parachutes full of white bread, and butter.
  </p>
  <p id="872">
   Q: White bread and what?
  </p>
  <p id="873">
   A: And — and butter.
  </p>
  <p id="874">
   Q: And butter.

  <p id="875">
   A: And butter. All in big parachutes, they threw them out, and they were — threw them out on — on — on what it was in big grass field for the cows, but [indecipherable] of course. And so — and of course from there, it was divided, and stolen and so on, of course, as you can understand.
  </p>
  <p id="876">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="877">
   A: But I know that the bottom of the plane was go — glass, and I know that —

  </p>
  <p id="882">
   Q: What a feeling that must have been.
  </p>
  <p id="883">
   A: Amazing. Amazing, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="884">
   Q: Did you see these planes many times?
  </p>
  <p id="885">
   A: No, a couple of times, but then, of course, later I could come to an airfield.
  </p>
  <p id="886">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="887">
   A: You know, but in the beginning there was no airfield.
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: Okay.
