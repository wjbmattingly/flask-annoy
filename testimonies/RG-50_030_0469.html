  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: My father, he was a baker, but h-he didn’t start his life to be a baker, yeah? He was from a village, a middle class family. Maybe I can tell you a little story about my father, yes? And that will lead us also to something in Auschwitz. When I was maybe, I don’t know, a little girl [indecipherable] so, but I remember myself, a little girl maybe six, maybe eight years old. My father stood in front of me and he said, “You know, when I was born, my mother died.” During - giving birth. And I ask, so -- and who brought you up? He said, “My grandfather took me to his place. And my mother’s name was Isen.” I was a little girl, I didn’t know how to react. I was sorry for him. And that’s it. We never talked about it, and so went on like that, til I will come to a story in Auschwitz, an interesting story, you read it.
  </p>

   A: The name --
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: -- [indecipherable] Isen.

  <p id="27">
   A: -- Isen. And when we came here to Canada, in two cases I met names -- two names, Isen. So I ask, are you Isen from this city Taria from Hungary? Said no, so I went on with life til this girl came to me and she said that she is with -- she is looking for her cousin -- no, for -- yes, for her cousin. So who is your cousins? Alice [indecipherable] called me Aliska -- Aliska Roth. So what’s your name? She said, “I am Vera Isen.” And that [indecipherable] the family --
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   A: -- of my father. So he was brought up then, back in the place of his father. When he married he took him, and he was there. And then he was a soldier in the first war, and he was captured by the Russians, right in the beginning, and he was in Siberia for s -- I think for six years in Siberia. And my mother gave birth to my brother before he went -- before he became a soldier. She didn’t know about him, that he’s alive. Somebody told her ca -- my mother -- I saw your husband dead on the ground. So she got a heart condition, she fainted [indecipherable] from her. And she believed the whole time that he died, that he is dead. And one day my brother was a little boy and he ca -- came, and he say, “Mommy, a Russian man is looking for you.” So -- and he came, he [indecipherable] and so they met, and then I was born, yeah. So my brother was nine years older from me, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Nine years older than you.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Yeah, because Siberia, the war, Siberia, and so -- and then my father struggled. He started with a store, they opened a little store, it didn’t work. Then he met a man, a baker, so his father gave him some money and they built a little bakery, because that was a family house, my grand- grandfather’s house where they lived. And so they struggled the whole [indecipherable] the whole life, they worked very, very hard. My parents were very honest and very, very hardworking people. My father got up in the morning very early like in a bakery. Later on my mother, and they worked. Then when it went a little bit better, they did took somebody to work there. Since -- I come from a poor -- quite poor family. Since my parent didn’t have money to send my brother to school, so they let him to learn some trade. So he was a glasser. And --
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: A what?
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Glasser -- glass -- glass --
  </p>
  <p id="34">

  </p>
  <p id="35">
   A: -- glass. And he was framing pictures, and he was a very smart, nice, hardworking boy. Then he became a manager in a store, like that. He was also very, very hardworking and very, very nice. Unfortunately, too nice. And the money which he made, the bi -- bigger part he gave to his- to my mother. And then he usually worked extra. Besides the store he framed pictures during the weekends, he should earn for himself. And that was a little bit easier, because my brother made money, the bakery was a little -- the best business was when the Germans came. The Germans invaded Slovakia. That was the best business in the bakery, because --
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: Well let -- let’s -- let’s go back just a little bit. Tell me what your father’s name was.
  </p>
  <p id="37">

  </p>
  <p id="38">
   Q: And your mother’s name?

  </p>
  <p id="42">

  </p>
  <p id="43">
   A: It’s Nikolos -- Nikolos. It’s --
  </p>
  <p id="44">
   Q: [indecipherable] right. Were you close with your father?
  </p>
  <p id="45">
   A: Yes, I was close with the whole family.
  </p>
  <p id="46">
   Q: With the whole family.
  </p>
  <p id="47">
   A: Was a very quiet girl, very, very quiet. They liked me, and I appreciated them very much.
  </p>
  <p id="48">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="49">
   A: Many times in the evenings, when they slept already, I was looking at them, and I thought, oh my God. Somehow I had a feeling, something wrong. But not like that. Only that they worked so hard, that my God, where will all this lead, that they work so hard? I’m so very sorry for them. And they’re very nice, very nice. Very, very nice.
  </p>
  <p id="50">
   Q: So you were a very sensitive child.
  </p>
  <p id="51">
   A: Yes. And my brother, I said that unfortunately he was too nice. He makes me the most sad, because my -- when they took the parents, my parents, he was at work, and he was hidden in the basement, there where worked. And when he heard that they took my parents, he ran away from his hidden pla -- place, came home to help my parents, to go with them, and therefore he went with them. And there -- I met once in a train, one of his friends who was in the same lager that he- he says they worked in a forest with my brother, many people went in, and the young men, in Deblin -- in Deblin, it’s somewhere near to Lublin. I didn't say -- I didn’t see mention these lager, this concentration lager, but it must have been a small lager. They worked in the forest and they [indecipherable] they did take the older people, older. My father was 53, my mother was 51. But that was older then. Th-They take them from the lager, they take them away. My brother wanted again to help them, so he ran away from the forest to help them. And so they took them -- took him also with my parents. That’s where they died, all three of them. My mother, she worked in a bakery, and she worked at home. She had many friends in the bakery, many, many friends, people liked her. She liked to talk. A real woman. And so I was a quiet child, working very, very hard, I studied hard because I promised myself that I don’t want to be poor. I have to make it. And therefore I studied for a decent future. And like a girl, a young girl, I hoped that I will be happy sometimes. That’s approximate the same. Maybe [indecipherable] will -- lived in a big house from my great-grandfather, yes? Apartment was small, but there were tenants there. It was an aun -- no, it was a -- an grand-aunt. Was my mother’s brother there, my mother’s sister there living. My mother’s two cousins, and then some tenants, all [indecipherable]. They were I think 12 relatives in the same house all [indecipherable]. Only one cousin returned from some or other, not from Auschwitz, I don’t remember. I never asked him where he was. He died in Montreal, we think.
  </p>
  <p id="52">
   Q: What did you like to study, Alice?
  </p>
  <p id="53">
   A: What?
  </p>
  <p id="54">
   Q: When -- when you were a child, what did you like to study?
  </p>
  <p id="55">
   A: I wanted to be always a teacher.
  </p>
  <p id="56">
   Q: Always?
  </p>
  <p id="57">
   A: Yeah. Somewhere important and somewhere where I can teach children to be good, to be nice. Not a knowledge -- I am not so very knowledgeable. Not. I have only a good heart, and I wanted people should be nice.
  </p>
  <p id="58">
   Q: And what made you think that you had to teach people to do that? Did you see a lot of cruelty before -- this is before Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: Not cruelty.
  </p>
  <p id="60">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="61">
   A: Not cruelty. But some of misery. People were poor, people didn’t understand each other. People didn’t try to help, they didn’t care about each other. It’s a like -- like here. Who cares if somebody’s poor, if some -- if they are not so poor, [indecipherable] somebody should care about us, but still I saw that it’s a big difference between people. Not too much understanding. It’s always a -- somehow watching people, how they think, how they -- and so, was interested in people. [inaudible]
  </p>
  <p id="62">
   Q: Was yours a religious home?
  </p>
  <p id="63">

  <p id="65">
   A: Kosher, my father went on Saturday to the synagogue, and our mother went during the big holidays to the synagogue, that’s all, yeah. It was -- the time was like that. It wasn’t nice when somebody didn't have kosher, hm?
  </p>
  <p id="66">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="67">
   A: If somebody didn't go in the synagogue, what kind of people are they? So we had to keep going, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="68">
   Q: And did you like this, or this was just [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="69">
   A: Well, it is natural, it was natural.
  </p>
  <p id="70">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="71">
   A: Yeah. When my mother went during the big holidays to the synagogue, I went to visit her. That’s [indecipherable] the Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, I think that was all, maybe. And she had an occasion to dress up with her big hat.

   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="73">
   A: Some -- she had some necklace, a big one. So she was [indecipherable] occasion. She had some people which she knew there. So she was happy to go out --

   A: She was happy to see me, and I was happy to see her dressed up and to be happy.
  </p>
  <p id="84">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="85">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="86">

  </p>
  <p id="94">
   Q: Explain that, wha -- wha --
  </p>
  <p id="95">
   A: Numerous classes mean a Slovak -- Slovak country, or a Slovak state become -- became a fascist state, and they didn’t permit all the Jew -- Jewish children to study, so it was a time when only the best ones did -- what were permitted to study, so the -- that was the last day, the last year, grade three, so this I made like numerous classes. So I made together two and six 1s eight, and three, eleven classes, yes? And then was not permitted more to study for Jewish people, so since in this technical school -- it was like a home economics school, you know? But also with academic [indecipherable] subjects, these academic subject. So I knew well to sew, I learned to sew th-there also. So at home I started to sew. I made money, and I was so young, but I thought it’s so hard, because I wanted. And then I learned -- during this time I learned to weave -- weaving scarves, yeah? And I made a few scarves and I went from store to store to offer my scarves -- scarves. Nobody wanted to buy them. And then I decided, no, I will go into the biggest store in PreSov, and I will try to offer them. So I showed my collection, and I said, I would like to make you scarf, all you scarf. He said, “Yes, I will buy it from you, how many you can make, but with one condition. That we -- you will not do it for anybody else. O-Only for my store.” I said yes, and I was happy. So -- he doesn’t know that nobody want it. So the whole time I made for them scarf, I was weaving scarves, scarfs -- my mother helped me to -- with the wools, with the yarns. And then I -- he asked, “Will you make turbans?” At the time turbans, they were in style. I said yes. So I taught my mother how to crochet this material, and I picked it up and I twisted it and so, and I sold turbans. And there were in the biggest store in the window, my turbans and my scarves. My father came once home, I said -- he said, “I saw your turbans and your scarves.” And I was so happy, and I put in pins and sew. And I made and I sewed, so I made the whole time some money. But the money -- I wasn’t so nice, and my brother because they didn’t need it, my money. So I was -- I bought for myself clothing, dressing, material, sewing. So I was always nicely dressed, like the richest.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="207">
   A: And I’m quite sure that she said more than she had to pay, yeah. She was happy, and she forgot about my father. Didn’t think about him. It was not her business to think about my father, or anybody’s [indecipherable]. He was a lovely man, was an angel.

   Q: And she was a terrible person, clearly.
  </p>
  <p id="209">

Somebody came to me, probably his wife, and h -- she asked, are you looking for somebody? I said no. I am here at home. And I turned away. I never entered my home, I never entered a bakery, and I didn’t ask from him money to pay for equipment or furnitures, I couldn’t. Because it didn’t make any difference. There was not more my father, and that didn’t belong more to me now. Not my home, and not the bakery. I didn’t want anything. I left. And I went many times into that courtyard.
  </p>
  <p id="212">

  <p id="214">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: So I went to the house, but I never entered the home. And I never entered and didn’t ask for the bakery. I didn’t want anything to have more in the garden with -- which belonged to me -- to my mother. There were plants, nice beautiful, big plants -- plants, and I wanted to -- to please my aunt in Humenné, yeah? So I went to ask for plants and I took them home, I wanted to take from my aunt. I took a big, big suit -- suitcase, because I knew that there are many plant. So the lady on the other side, was different from this side, she came -- she came to me and she said, “Aliska, don’t take all the plants. I need them for my children.” And I said, “Don’t worry. It will be a time that you belong again to me.” Because she felt that the house belongs to him. And I took the plants and I left, but I never went again to -- to -- to the garden, to this garden til it was not on my name. Then I couldn’t legally take it, yes. I didn’t want to. Not greedy, no. Nothing could be -- replace me my family, nothing. Not plants, not bakery, not home, nothing. They were not there.

I said you -- and I don’t know where you are. So they said when -- til noon you will not be on the fire station, then the policemen will look -- be looking for you, and they will take you there.” And that was a shame a policeman should take me.

I know only that it was there SS, an SS. And he had our names, and he checked our names, he called our names, if we all are there, and that was very scary. An SS man to say -- we saw the Wehrmacht or so in the city, when they occupied there, but there we saw an SS. [indecipherable] that hat, yes, the SS, I didn’t know that’s SS.

And a SS came, strictly in German, he said the rules how we have to behave, and he -- yeah, and also he said that we have to go on turns to the kitchen for -- for soup and for water outside in the courtyard. So -- and when we -- I went for water with [indecipherable] outside. And they were -- was a soldier, a Slovak soldier, Slovak, not an SS at the pump, water pump [indecipherable]. And he said -- til then I thought that everybody’s from PreSov, yes, I didn’t look around. Many girls. So -- and he s -- who is here from PreSov? I said, I am. He said, “Stay here, I want to talk to you.” Soldier, this Slovak. And then he mentioned some names, Jewish names, boys from PreSov. I didn’t know all of them, but I knew the names. And he said then -- suddenly he said, “Do you know where you go?” I said, “No. Is it Bata? Is 1t Svit?” He said, “No. You are going to Poland, and your families will go after you, and you will never return from there.” So I was shocked. He didn’t say anything. I turned away and I left. I didn’t say to the girls nothing because I didn’t want to create some panic, and I don’t -- didn’t want for him make some problems, so I didn’t say anything. Only in the lager, when I was in Auschwitz, so I thought about him many times, I thought, well maybe this soldier wanted to help me, because we were somehow only alone there when they [indecipherable] only him and me. And so went by time, I returned. I was working in a store. I was married that time. I became a manager in the store. I was sitting in the [indecipherable] and this Slovak soldier arrived into the store, a uniform, an officer. I looked at him, I said, oh that’s him. And I ask him, “Tell me, where have you been in March 1942?” He said, “In Poprad.” I said, “I remember you, and I was thinking about you many times. And I thought that you were willing to help me. Do you remember me?” He said, “Yes, I remember you.” He said, “Yes, I wanted to help you.” Maybe he wanted, maybe he said it after the war, I don’t know, but that’s what he said. He left, and I never met him again, he never entered the store. Was interesting.

We went to a forest, and with my knowledge of geography -- Hugo would laugh at me, I thought maybe we are in Siberia. It’s cold, snow, forest and forest and forest, where are we? So then stopped the train, and some people were at the train station there. So I asked in Slovak, “Where are we?” And somebody said, “You are in Poland,” in Polish language. So we knew that [indecipherable] we are in Poland, and I was sitting next to a girl who was teaching in a kindergarten, so we started to talk about escaping. We will escape from here, from Poland. Was very easy to make plans, but -- we came there, we didn’t stopped --

   A: -- to strive, to believe with nobody -- and I will survive. But basically nobody will survive, nobody, because at the last time, at the last day, they will -- they will throw bombs or something. The last day they will kill us all. So if alls I hoped, I believed, but logically, nobody will survive.

   A: Later on I made friends there. I had a very, very close friend who became like a sister to me. I still didn’t forget her. I never had a sister and she was like my sister.
  </p>
  <p id="610">
   Q: What was her name?
  </p>
  <p id="611">
   A: Dieter Rishter, from Bratislava. Was a story -- I have so many stories.
  </p>
  <p id="612">
   Q: That’s great.
  </p>
  <p id="613">
   A: When I was home, at home, my uncle the teacher, he was not much older than me because he was from the second husband of my grandmother, yeah. He wasn’t much older. Even I liked him like [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on the table, I was looking at it. And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was signed like, eira Dieter, e1ra Dieter, yeah. I didn’t ask anybody. I always had the nature not to ask, I don’t ask people anything. When they s -- you say something to me, you say [indecipherable]. So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from Bratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit. That’s it. And went to [indecipherable] in the lager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the Canadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah. So was in lager also. The first day, the girls started. Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes. I was from west Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia, Bratislava was from west Slovakia. So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw -- right away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don’t ri -- in winter after we came there. We were standing the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold. We are standing there. And that time I think we didn’t have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the line. [indecipherable]. There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and they were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from. I said from this part of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are. You are -- you don’t belong there [indecipherable]. I was very honored, yes. Bigger group. So and there was a girl and they played around with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter. Dieter, yeah. And I ask her, ‘Are you Dieter Rishter?” She said, “Yes, I am Dieter Rishter.” So -- because he told me her name is Dieter Rishter. So I said, my uncle is whoever. She said, oh, I remember him very well. And then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together. Because we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds, everybody had one bed, not this bunk. [indecipherable]. But two -- two girls slept together because these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together. She has a -- she had the older sister there. So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends. We worked together, we were in the same commando and we were together. But she became sick. And when we had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs. We were sitting in the sauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs, she was very, very sick. I took care of her. And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting there in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was the biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, 1t wasn’t place where to sleep, then they made the selection. Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one, then five left, and so on and so on and so. So I asked myself someday, how come that they never selected me, that they never pointed on me. So I came to the conclusion, maybe it’s true, because I never looked at them. [indecipherable] like this. I was straight, and I never looked up there. I says, and maybe they pointed and I didn’t see. But I think [indecipherable] maybe [indecipherable]. Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go in front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it, that time. So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter should pass by. [indecipherable]. So -- and she went, she passed. They didn’t take her to the gas chamber, she passed by. I was so happy, thanks God. Dieter went through sick. And then we had to line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, SO, SO, So -- So I lost her, no. She went somewhere else. And the next day in the morning, I don’t remember if we didn’t go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the other one to call her name. Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter. No answer. So I went to the next barrack, and to next barrack. And somebody said, “Dieter Rishter died.” She survived the selection, but she died, sick and exhausted. So what happened? She went down from the [indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down. She went down, she fell down. And she wasn’t [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other [indecipherable] and I lost Dieter. I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl. So -- and before -- excuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="614">
   Q: So you were together for a -- a year --
  </p>
  <p id="615">
   A: A few months --
  </p>
  <p id="616">
   Q: A few months.
  </p>
  <p id="617">
   A: -- or maybe longer, I don’t know, maybe longer. We made even business together, because she was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas chamber when the people arrived. They had to drop there the things, they didn't arrive to the lager to leave them. And then they carried the things to our company and we had to -- to -- to fold them, to bundle them, and they send it, probably to Germany. And people had some jewelries, diamonds, and -- in their clothing, yeah. So it was there a pile of this clothing and they have to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I was folding, yeah. So she said once, when I will call summerkleider, summer dresses, so you come, that means that I found something, some jewelry, something. So once she found ducats -- ducats, golden ducats, golden [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="618">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="619">
   A: So I took it a few ounce, I think eight or so. And there was a man, because he worked in a -- in a -- in a -- in the compound where men were, so there was a block -- she was hannah blockalteste, he was a blockalteste, Polish man. I used to see him to come in -- into work place, so -- and I noticed that he takes something from girls and then he brings something. So I stopped him, I said I have ducats, I have golden ducats, I gave him. So for these eight big golden ducats, he gives maybe four little breads, and -- a-and a margarine, I think a [indecipherable] for this one, so we had for two, three days.

So, it was at the beginning, I was still in Auschwitz one, in Auschwitz one, and I had good shoes with laces, high shoes, good shoes, but it was I think in the spring, because I remember that the sole was wet sometimes, and -- and cold still. So I don’t know which month it could have been, yes. Maybe between -- between the naishtuber, laundry, maybe between the laundry, because from laundry I went to the naishtuber between -- before. So we had to wear impossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders. You tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and barefoot in to walk to a forest where there were little stones like gravel, yeah? And we have to walk, so -- and [indecipherable] little gravels, they were cold, and they were wet. And first of all my -- my soles, they became hard and -- and painful, yes, you mention, like that. Later on the soles, they became hard, trained well, no problem. But my eyes, probably from an infa -- an inflammation from these cold stones. So on my eyelashes, they were some kind of glue. You know, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn’t open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the eyelashes, got dry glue. So I had to take off little by little, little by little. And then next night again happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a few -- for a time with this -- my eyes, and -- and one morning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes, and then we had to take off the shoes, and to come back again barefooten, again this -- to this -- through this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel chilly when I think about it. So one day I was standing on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stand in the -- I don’t know why, in the front, first one. And suddenly was quie -- very quiet, very quiet, and I heard this name Himmler. I knew who was him, who was Himmler. I looked around, not frar -- far from me was standing Himmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses. Oh my God, I was so scared that Himmler will look at me, and he’ll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought this [indecipherable] I heard the Gypsies, they used to have [indecipherable] too. I was so scared he would send me for death. I didn't know that time gas chambers was in Auschwitz. So I moved slowly, slowly in the back, he shouldn’t see me, I should save myself from Himmler. He was standing there looking.

  <p id="819">
   A: Yes, very silently, very, very silently. I was in block 10 -- block 10, that was a last -- well, you said it, in Auschwitz were 11 blocks.
  </p>
  <p id="820">
   Q: I think. In Auschwitz one.
  </p>
  <p id="821">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="822">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="823">
   A: You are right.
  </p>
  <p id="824">
   Q: And you were in 10.
  </p>
  <p id="825">
   A: I was in 10.
  </p>
  <p id="826">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="827">
   A: And on the 10, on block 10 on the -- and I was sleeping next to the window at the end. [indecipherable] block, block, block, the end, and I was sleeping at the window at the end. And there were boards on the windows, boards, but there were little distances between the boards, yes, wooden boards. Little, little distances, and used to look during the day when I came -- it was light, yeah, but at the beginning I even didn’t go for a few days to work because I was washing the stairs and the -- and -- and the -- the floors and whatever. It made me sickening, that was depressing. So anyhow, during the day when we came early probably, I don’t know what time, I cannot say that, but I know that was light then, until August was lighter in the day [indecipherable] the little distances, I saw these high, high poles, steel from st -- I think from steel, wood, or steel, I don’t know. They were high poles, that’s for sure, a pole like this, and then crosswise on the top, and there I saw a man, young men -- they were high, again I say high, higher than a man. They were hanging like that, the hands in the back like this, like this, and here betwe -- they were hanging on the poles so that their feet didn’t reach the floor -- the earth -- the floor, yes? The earth -- the concrete or what.
  </p>
  <p id="828">
   Q: So they -- they were being hung by their hands behind their back?
  </p>
  <p id="829">
   A: Yeah, they were hanged there. So I saw this one, always a few, few, few. And then during the night, sometimes -- sometimes, not always, sometimes I -- but I was always scared to look th- there, I knew I don’t have to see that, was a silent shooting, very silently, cause I was at the window. And I didn't look out so I wouldn’t see, because it was darkness probably, I don’t -- no, I didn’t look. But I heard silent shooting. So I thought, oh, now they are killing, and now after the war, I was in Auschwitz, and I asked somebody there [indecipherable] when I left [indecipherable] I met her in Birkenau. I said, I didn’t see these poles where the people were hanging. But then later somehow on -- before I -- before I ask, because then bef -- then I went through these barracks, becau -- and I saw in one place these pole. And my son, I said, you see, these are these poles where people were hanging. And she said it was a quiet [indecipherable] I says, and every night I heard a very, very silent shooting. She said yes, during the night was this silent shooting. And there is now a wall, a-and flowers and Slovak people put flowers. I think it’s black. And even the wooden walls, I think they are black now.
  </p>
  <p id="830">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="831">
   A: Yeah, because she asked me, was it painted? I said no. From this side was not, I didn’t see it from the other side.
  </p>
  <p id="832">
   Q: Yeah, Alice, when you say silent shooting, what -- what do you mean? You mean that there was -- there was a silencer on the gun that -- or that you were so far away you could only hear it a little bit?
  </p>
  <p id="833">
   A: I wasn’t far.
  </p>
  <p id="834">
   Q: You weren’t far.
  </p>
  <p id="835">
   A: I’m far because I was -- I slept at the win -- next to the window.
  </p>
  <p id="836">
   Q: Uh-huh. Which was close to that wall.
  </p>
  <p id="837">
   A: It’s the closest to the wall.
  </p>
  <p id="838">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="839">
   A: So maybe was silent gun, I don’t understand [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="840">
   Q: Yeah, but what were you hearing, a pop? Just a --
  </p>
  <p id="841">
   A: Yeah, something like that, yes, not like boom, boom, in the war.
  </p>
  <p id="842">

   A: In combat in the field. Not like that. Silently.
  </p>
  <p id="844">
   Q: You -- you didn't help at all in building Birkenau. Some of the prisoners were doing that. Were you ever over there?

   A: We came like to a village, yes, like the village, and that we, for three months were demolishing.
  </p>
  <p id="852">
   Q: And that became Auschwitz-Birkenau?
  </p>
  <p id="853">
   A: I think --
  </p>
  <p id="854">
   Q: You think so, but you you’re -- but you’re not sure.
  </p>
  <p id="855">
   A: I think it. Iam not sure. I know we demolished it there, that place --
  </p>
  <p id="856">

  <p id="860">
   Q: Making it smooth?
  </p>

And it was at the beginning where we worked at the roads, we [indecipherable] the roads, there was also a civilian who was leading this probably [indecipherable] and the kapos, and SS men, and we worked. And then they were looking, so we were working when they were not looking and not working, and [indecipherable] see in -- in -- in German number -- number eight is acht.

  <p id="864">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="865">

[indecipherable]. Then we worked hard. We couldn’t work always like that [indecipherable] it easy.
  </p>
  <p id="866">

  </p>
  <p id="867">

  </p>
  <p id="887">
   A: I don’t know. Probably it could happen that we were on a zaehlappell on a roll call, and they said now turn and we go.
  </p>
  <p id="888">
   Q: And you go.

   Q: The bowl.
  </p>
  <p id="893">
   A: If we took it with us or we -- or we left it in the -- in the barrack and -- and then we got it when -- received it when we ar -- I cannot -- I don’t remember, this I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="894">
   Q: Did you carry the bowl with you all the time?
  </p>
  <p id="895">
   A: No, that what I don’t remember. I know that we had some little sack hanging, and I don’t remember where we took the material to sew it and a needle. I don’t remember. I can see myself only suddenly hanging here something.
  </p>
  <p id="896">
   Q: Something.
  </p>
  <p id="897">
   A: Mm.
  </p>
  <p id="898">

   A: And a little -- a little bit of bread which we saved from the evening.
  </p>
  <p id="900">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="901">
   A: And maybe a -- a first knife or s -- when somebody found somewhere on the field a little -- a little steel or something, and we sharped it on -- on -- on a stone, an-and we cut our bread. So maybe these -- maybe we found somewhere a -- I don’t know how we got a spoon, I don’t know, I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="902">
   Q: You weren’t given a spoon, you were given the bowl.
  </p>
  <p id="903">
   A: The bowl, but I don’t remember we carried the -- with us when we went to work far, where we were serve. I don’t think -- I cannot see the -- the move around, I know we have only this little sack, and a little bread, and if we had a little plate, this 1s to cut our bread and [indecipherable] I don’t remember that, this I don’t. I know only a little bread, and on the way to work, always a bite. It was easy, because we didn’t have to think too much, we -- our thinking went so far as into the [indecipherable] I have still a slice of bread, I get still a little bit.
  </p>
  <p id="904">
   Q: So -- so your mental state becomes smaller and smaller?
  </p>
  <p id="905">
   A: Smaller and smaller.
  </p>
  <p id="906">
   Q: So that you think about very few things.
  </p>
  <p id="907">
   A: Yes. The emotions, they tend to apathy, total apathy. You think, I do this, I will think about food, I will think about when they will -- no, only when we arrive -- when we arrive back afterward, we think if we have a blanket to cover ourselves. Little things, we -- if it is cold, if it 1s
  </p>
  <p id="908">
   Q: If you picture the barrack and your bed in Auschwitz one, do you see the bowl there? Do you think that you left the bowl on the bed?
  </p>
  <p id="909">
   A: Not on the bed, maybe there was a little room, concrete floor, maybe -- may -- there were servants stumalteste, stumdienst, maybe. Maybe they got there, th-that they put it there, and they washed it there, but 1t wasn’t dirty because if you didn’t wash it -- in Birkenau, we didn’t have water. So couldn’t be so dirty that [indecipherable] after food. So probably they carried from -- probably. I don’t know -- know, I speculate on it. Probably they got from the sauna, water, the sauna in a bucket or so, and they washed it there and they left it and then we took it from there. A little room at the end of the barrack -- of the block. I -- I don’t remember how it was.
  </p>
  <p id="910">
   Q: So do you remember entering Birkenau in August of ’43, do you remember --
  </p>
  <p id="911">
   A: Oh yes.
  </p>
  <p id="912">
   Q: -- that first day?
  </p>
  <p id="913">
   A: Yes, yes, I remember.
  </p>
  <p id="914">
   Q: What -- what can you tell me about it? What was it like?
  </p>
  <p id="915">
   A: We entered and -- and difference was that they were brick barracks, brick blocks in Auschwitz, also brick blocks, but they were lower -- lower brick blocks. And in Auschwitz we had beds, bed, everybody has a bed, or we didn’t have -- and there were these bunks, in Birkenau were bunks, one, two, three.
  </p>
  <p id="916">
   Q: And it’s three, three high, right?
  </p>
  <p id="917">
   A: Three, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="918">
   Q: And more than two people are sleeping on each bunk?
  </p>
  <p id="919">
   A: Oh my God. Yes, depends how many people were in the block. There were also sometimes five people, and -- and so I fell once down during the night when I had to go on it, so we were four like that, and above us like that, crosswise. And I was afraid to s -- that I will sit on -- on this person who is crosswise, so I went to the end, very end. So I -- I went to the end. So I fell on my back on the concrete, and was a big boom. In the morning I went to work, and back pain.
  </p>
  <p id="920">
   Q: In a lot of pain?
  </p>
  <p id="921">
   A: Oh, ho, how. I still remember. I was young.
  </p>
  <p id="922">
   Q: But it’s interesting, because as bad as Auschwitz one was, Birkenau was much worse.
  </p>
  <p id="923">
   A: Much worse.
  </p>
  <p id="924">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="925">
   A: In b -- in Auschwitz, we didn’t know about the gas chambers. We didn’t know. We worked, was very, very hard to work. We didn’t know about the gas chambers. When we came from work we ran around into the -- into this washroom or whatever, there were horizontal pipes, went to clean up, and maybe we washed something. There were toilets, there were toilets, I -- I remember, so maybe I am wrong, but in my memories that there were -- yes, surely there were toilets, because there were toilet rumors. We went in the toilet and we heard rumor that the -- the wagons are from Slovakia here, they came to pick up us, and so on, so -- there were toil -- there were toilets, there is wasser -- water [indecipherable] more. We were not gas -- there were gas chambers, which I saw after when I went, after the war, two or three ga -- not gas chambers but crematorium. Were no gas chambers, at least we didn’t know about the gas chambers. We worked very hard. The same food, but it was easier.
  </p>
  <p id="926">

  </p>
  <p id="927">
   A: Yeah, yeah, it was easier.
  </p>
  <p id="928">
   Q: So Birkenau becomes a shock. There is no running water, right?
  </p>
  <p id="929">
   A: No run -- only in the sauna. In the sauna they used for us and we went for delousing, get delousing. And that time [indecipherable] the delousing we went to a -- to a real sauna where they used hot bricks, hot bricks and they pour water on it, so it was a steam, so we went in the steam. And there were showers in the sauna, in the same building, yes. It was -- but outside was - it was not -- it wasn’t a toilet, was a latrine, yeah. And we had to go far up.
  </p>
  <p id="930">
   Q: Right. It’s a -- a room with just lots of holes in it, right?
  </p>
  <p id="931">
   A: Not holes.

  <p id="932">
   Q: Holes?
  </p>
  <p id="933">
   A: The hole was open.
  </p>
  <p id="934">
   Q: Ah, period, completely open.
  </p>
  <p id="935">
   A: Open, and there was like a bench, and we had to -- we went on the bench, and -- and we lean to there, and -- and we hold it on. It was also -- they had also -- it was on one side up the hill, and down there were toilets, but a German haftlings, for the German prisoners. The Germans. They had -- had toilet, but not a toilet like that. Was something also like a latrine, something like that, that was a clean one and so for the Germans. They didn’t let us at the beginning, only at the end then, the -- they said the Slovaks [indecipherable] Slovaks.

And like these my friend, these -- who had insulin in -- in this one, the purse, in -- in the suitcase, I didn’t see her more, that means they were taken. And also up the stairs was a little like a loft, a little room, and some family was looking out through the window, they didn’t go to zaehlappell and they loo -- used to smile at us, you know, they were so happy that they are there. They didn’t go to -- but they disappeared also. So they -- probably with these black car, they took people out. An-And we used to hear or say that they’re in the forest with this white uniform, was where that flame, we say that they take there, the people to burn.

  <p id="998">

  </p>
  <p id="1008">
   Q: Yes, and what did you do?
  </p>
  <p id="1009">
   A: I -- I knew that I cannot make it more. I was so tired, an-and hungry, and everything, and when I will go on like this, next selection I am going, they will take me, I cannot take it more. So I took a risk and I stayed in the barrack, in the block, I didn’t go to work. And I knew that I take a risk because when -- sometimes, once in awhile the SS, somebody from the SS came through, they went through the barrack, the blocks. And when they found somebody who didn’t go to work, they took to block 25. And I took this risk. I said, I cannot. I have to take risk that they will come today and they will take me to block 25. I cannot walk, first, then I was lying there on the - on the bunk, and the -- for lunchtime -- for lunchtime I went to the kitchen to -- to carry this food, that I helped them [indecipherable] and I was lying there. And a girl came the afternoon, and she said, in the lager, they are selecting for a new commando. So I went there, she said exactly where. And that was the place where the -- we saw that there’s a new commando, it was called [indecipherable] a new uniform, stripe. In the morning I lined up and I went to [indecipherable] this one. And I was not safe, I was happy. Had good work, yeah. I stayed there for -- for October, ma-maybe through summer or so, °43. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1010">
   Q: 1943.
  </p>
  <p id="1011">

  </p>
  <p id="1026">
   A: Yeah, that’s it.
  </p>
  <p id="1027">
   Q: And this was where you were sorting clothes?
  </p>
  <p id="1028">
   A: Yeah, because there was [indecipherable], in -- in Birkenau was a commando sc -- which they wore red scarves, so they were red scarves and that was the Canada called. So they were the red scarves and we were the white scarves.
  </p>
  <p id="1029">
   Q: So what was the difference between the work that you were doing sorting clothes and the work that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know?
  </p>
  <p id="1030">
   A: I couldn’t say exactly. I think that we had from the gas chamber, things in the gas chamber, and people arrived straight there. And those I don’t know. We had that. Maybe they had also from the gas chamber, but it was so much that they divided there, [indecipherable] that.
  </p>
  <p id="1031">
   Q: And -- and your commando wasn’t connected with Canada commando?
  </p>
  <p id="1032">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1033">
   Q: No, it was totally separate.
  </p>
  <p id="1034">
   A: Yeah, only when -- when the commando was closed, then we were transferred or suggested to go there --
  </p>
  <p id="1035">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1036">
   A: -- yeah, to Canada.
  </p>
  <p id="1037">

  </p>
  <p id="1038">

  </p>
  <p id="1039">
   Q: No, no, the other one [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="1040">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1041">
   Q: And wh-why did you like that and you didn’t like the Canada?
  </p>
  <p id="1042">
   A: It was so relaxing there, relaxing. We relaxing in [indecipherable]. The commander, the SS, Scharfuehrer, was very nice, a nice man. He was very helpful when it was longer -- for longer at zaehlappell, yes, roll call, and during that time was sometimes a selection after this roll call, so -- or when the commanders arrived, then he kept us longer there to work. We didn't work, but he kept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy, that we have to stay longer, and so probably he saved many people.
  </p>
  <p id="1043">
   Q: I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1044">
   A: And we had to cross only from one -- from one ba -- not barrack, from one part to the other part through a big door, so we -- we avoided the main door also, by coming home and selection we avoided. And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there, so he let many girls to sit on, and not to work. And he asked for tea, for enough tea to drink. So he carried in a lot of tea we should have enough, fever -- feverish and who couldn’t work, didn’t have to work. He was a ma- ma -- nice man. That was very important. And the other one, maybe he was also nice, but I didn’t like him, he was so noisy. During the first lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we ate, he said lie down all of you. We had to put the food down an-and to lie down in the mud. And then when -- after work, the girls -- not always, I wasn’t there for a -- for a few days, but sometimes we had to undress and so he looked through ours if we didn’t take something. He was so s -- crazy. Didn’t like it.
  </p>
  <p id="1045">
   Q: Do you remember the name of this nice man [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1046">
   A: Yeah, I think it Ambrose.
  </p>
  <p id="1047">
   Q: Ambrose.
  </p>
  <p id="1048">
   A: I think that Ambrose was his name, I think so. Or something similar, because we called him Scharfuehrer.
  </p>
  <p id="1049">
   Q: Right. Were you surprised that there would be somebody who was so nice 1n that position? It’s an odd position to be in and then --
  </p>
  <p id="1050">
   A: I wasn’t surprised, I was pleased.
  </p>
  <p id="1051">
   Q: Mm. So how did it happen that you moved from this commando? It was closed?
  </p>
  <p id="1052">
   A: It was closed. He -- it was closed, but in the meantime he wasn’t more there, the other one, somebody else came. I don’t know what -- sometimes they placed to other places. Maybe he was too nice, I don’t know, but -- what the reason.
  </p>
  <p id="1053">
   Q: Uh-huh, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1054">
   A: And the other one, he wasn’t for long there, but he suggested me there for, because one day he came and he asked, who knows the difference between pure silk and artificial material. I say, I know it, cause I learned at school. So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk lingerie to take out and to bundle it differently. So he knew that I am not stupid.
  </p>
  <p id="1055">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1056">
   A: I was -- I was quiet, but I knew things. And then the other one, the new one from Canada asked, ““What’s your name?” And I didn’t answer [indecipherable] say -- so he said, “How is she- how is she smart, she doesn’t know how to talk even.” And he said, “Yes, she knows how to talk.” So he took me. But I didn’t like him, you know, it was -- for -- for a Auschwitz, wasn’t the attitude, not the -- the girls they were used to him, so they laughed, they joked with him.
  </p>
  <p id="1057">
   Q: Yeah [indecipherable] but you didn’t --
  </p>
  <p id="1058">
   A: I couldn’t, no. Didn’t want to.
  </p>
  <p id="1059">
   Q: Were these commandos protected commandos, there were no selections?
  </p>
  <p id="1060">
   A: No, no, no, no.

  </p>
  <p id="1062">
   A: Were selection. They came also later from Canada. They came also later, so sometimes they avoided selections. But this one [indecipherable] be avoided. Once happened that in the morning one girl didn’t arrive, and somebody told him. He was -- she was selected in the afternoon, or in the morning. So he t-took his bike and he went there, and then in -- he returned, he said that he told them that she’s the best worker in his commando, when they will not return her, then she has to -- he has to close the commando, so then he brought her back.
  </p>
  <p id="1063">
   Q: And he brought her back.
  </p>
  <p id="1064">
   A: Yeah, he was a -- a really -- a good man.
  </p>
  <p id="1065">
   Q: But were there selections inside the commando?
  </p>
  <p id="1066">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1067">
   Q: Only from the barrack’?

  </p>
  <p id="1074">
   A: Or that time when I met this Dieter Rishter, and we’re standing the whole Sunday, after, when we came into the lager, there was a ditch, a ditch. So we had to jump through the ditch. And who didn’t make it, went to chamber.
  </p>
  <p id="1075">

   A: -- the back -- they said from the front that who cannot jump over, they take you away because [indecipherable] standing there, but it was before.
  </p>
  <p id="1091">
   Q: So when you went to the Canada commando, you didn't stay for very long.
  </p>
  <p id="1092">
   A: No, no.
  </p>
  <p id="1093">

   A: -- no, for a few days, for a few -- and then I went to Ausenkommando.
  </p>
  <p id="1097">
   Q: And that was less difficult for you. You liked that better, being outside [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1098">
   A: I decided. I decided I go rather to Ausenkommando, what will happen will happen. And then, from that, what I -- it was a good decision because I would have stayed in Canada. But from Ausenkommando -- Ausenkommando I took a [indecipherable] a risk. Say that’s enough, now I have to do something else. So -- and then I became a Laeuferin.
  </p>
  <p id="1099">
   Q: And how did that happen? Can you explain?
  </p>
  <p id="1100">
   A: Yeah. That was risky. There was -- was a Rapportfuehrer, an SS, his name was Hans Tauber, Austrian. He was very bad, he was very bad. Always on the back and he was hitting. He had always something in his boot, here, some -- some -- I don’t know, [indecipherable] or what. He was hitting --
  </p>
  <p id="1101">

  </p>
  <p id="1102">
   A: -- he -- every pers -- yes, he was hitting, and he was selecting, he was everything bad. The both men in the la -- the both -- both men in the lager. And I heard that they will open the other entrance, other entrance to the lager from the outside, entrance [indecipherable] and that they will need Laeuferins, you know Laeuferin? Well, it’s like they send, run here, run here, there’s a Laeuferin come, go to the other door [indecipherable] go to this barrack, to this block and so -- so they needed, I heard that. So I decided -- decided, I says, I will talk to Tauber, the worst. And after the appell, after that zaehlappell, I was on the road, on the sidewalk and he went on his bike, this strong Tauber. And I stopped him from the bike, and I said, Herr Rapportfuehrer, haftling [speaks German here]. Mr. Rapportfuehrer -- you will understand, yes, that want to talk - talk to you. So he went down from the bike, and was standing looking at me. And I said, I am here from the very beginning -- it was true. I didn’t say it between I was a [indecipherable] beginning, and I am -- I worked in Ausenkommando. And I know that you are the only one who can help me. I heard that you need Laeuferin, other Laeuferin. I would like to be a Laeuferin. And he said, “Go to Katya,” she was the -- the -- the main registrar. Yeah, the Schreibstuber, Katya Singer. “Go to her and say that I send you that she should place you in a other block where the Laeuferins are.” So, thanks a lot. And I let -- ran to Katya Singer, and I said, Tauber send me. She said, I need a -- a written note from Tauber. Couldn’t do anything else. Next day -- morning, I went to Ausenkommando again, and then in the evening when it was zaehlappell, he came to the block, and he was choosing the other girl for Laeuferin. So I went out to him, and I said, “Herr |-lager -- Herr Rapportfuehrer, I spoke to you yesterday and I went to Katya Singer, and she said that she wants -- she needs from you a note, a written note.” She didn’t say -- he didn’t say anything, he said to the -- turned to the blockalteste and said, “Take her also to Katya, take both to Katya.” So she took us to Katya, and I became Laeuferin. And then I was safe, I didn’t go to selections, and I had a bed for myself, I had a nice block. Became an [indecipherable]

  <p id="1165">
   Q: Wooden barracks, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1166">

  </p>
  <p id="1167">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1168">
   A: -- with her three colleagues there. We stayed there, we were [indecipherable] that time -- we stayed there, I don’t know how long, maybe a month, w -- I don’t know how long, and then we were moved to block four, where the Schreibstuber was, the main office.
  </p>
  <p id="1169">
   Q: And -- and you knew Mala Zimetbaum?
  </p>
  <p id="1170">
   A: Oh yes, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="1171">
   Q: What was she like?
  </p>
  <p id="1172">
   A: Was like --
  </p>
  <p id="1173">
   Q: How do you remember her’?
  </p>
  <p id="1174">
   A: Very proud girl, very proud. Courageous.
  </p>
  <p id="1175">
   Q: Courageous.
  </p>
  <p id="1176">
   A: Courageous. Nice person. Yes, somehow -- so a little bit proud, proud, yes. And when some officer came by car in, I used to go and open the door for him, and she was always angry when she saw that. Don’t open the door, don’t do anything for them. But I wanted. I wanted to be nice to them. Not a big thing when I open the door for them.
  </p>
  <p id="1177">
   Q: Right. And what about the other two, there were two other women who were also Laeuferin --
  </p>
  <p id="1178">
   A: Yeah, I think they opened also --
  </p>
  <p id="1179">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1180">
   A: -- the door, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1181">
   Q: Now, was the situation in that block as good as it was in block four or not?
  </p>
  <p id="1182">
   A: In which block?
  </p>
  <p id="1183">
   Q: The -- the earlier block, when you were with [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1184">
   A: Nobody bothered with us. We were Laeuferin, so --
  </p>
  <p id="1185">
   Q: Right, so you were safe.
  </p>
  <p id="1186">
   A: Yeah, this was so private somehow, like we were -- we had the same -- the same food, we didn’t have more than them, at the beginning, yes. But we could go to the -- to the [indecipherable] it’s the -- the clothing where they had the -- we could choose some dresses, some clothing, so we were well dressed. That was the different. We could go into the sauna to wash --
  </p>
  <p id="1187">
   Q: To wash yourself, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1188">
   A: Wash myself and the clothing to wash. We could go to the [indecipherable] to the [indecipherable] hospital.
  </p>
  <p id="1189">
   Q: The hospital, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1190">
   A: And I needed very much to go to the [indecipherable] because I was full of pus, full of pus. Furuncles, and the big full furuncles they were called carbuncles. They had more heads, you know? When I was running, oh ho, now opened the car -- full of pus, the carbuncles. Here I had - under arm I had pus --
  </p>
  <p id="1191">
   Q: And where does that come from, what is that --
  </p>
  <p id="1192">
   A: Let me tell you.
  </p>
  <p id="1193">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1194">
   A: Here I had full of -- I was full of pus.
  </p>
  <p id="1195">
   Q: Really?
  </p>
  <p id="1196">
   A: Lack of hygiene.
  </p>
  <p id="1197">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1198">
   A: La-Lack of nourishment, yeah. I survived, but how.
  </p>
  <p id="1199">
   Q: How”
  </p>
  <p id="1200">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1201">
   Q: Is there medication? Was there anything that you took?
  </p>
  <p id="1202">
   A: No, I -- when I was Laeuferin and there was a Dr. Ross, a Jewish doctor, and I went to her to as -- she gave me this well known ishtiole, you know ishtiole? So this made ripe these -- these furuncles and these -- and some [indecipherable] she gave me, and -- and I don’t know. And then was -- I don’t remember, 1s white ointment, was when the furuncle was opened and you put it on, white this one. And then slowly, slowly I was nursing myself on my bed when I came, and I went to wash myself, to shower myself. And I ate better than before. So it healed, it healed, it healed, but I still have scars.
  </p>
  <p id="1203">
   Q: But in that condition, had you not been a Laeuferin, and in a protected commando, you probably would have been killed, because you would have looked sick.
  </p>
  <p id="1204">
   A: I didn’t look so sick.
  </p>
  <p id="1205">
   Q: No?
  </p>
  <p id="1206">
   A: No. And fortunately, we didn’t ha -- sorry, we didn't have to undr -- I don’t remember that I had to undress. It’s only to have straight shoes.
  </p>
  <p id="1207">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1208">
   A: To walk straight.
  </p>
  <p id="1209">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1210">
   A: Fingers, we have to go like this, and I don’t know what, a lock, you know. That what -- would have been worse and worse and worse, yes. For sure -- for sure it wouldn't help.
  </p>
  <p id="1211">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1212">
   A: It wouldn’t help, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1213">
   Q: Were you surprised at the conditions in block four? That everybody had -- you had your own bed, and --
  </p>
  <p id="1214">
   A: I wasn’t surprised.
  </p>
  <p id="1215">
   Q: You weren't?
  </p>
  <p id="1216">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1217">
   Q: You knew that that was --
  </p>
  <p id="1218">
   A: Yeah, because they looked nice, they looked healthy, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1219">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1220">
   A: And then in -- in a four -- block four, there were girls from the [indecipherable] where the s -- the non-Jewish people, they received parcels, they received packages and some of them, they died, but not in the chamber, not the non-Jewish.
  </p>
  <p id="1221">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1222">
   A: So they were always on the left overs of packages. So and gir -- the girls from the [indecipherable] from this package place, they lived also in block four. So they had permission, it was a ver -- extras. They had permission to bring in, [indecipherable] they gave us something [indecipherable] all we ha -- we received from there some [indecipherable] something that we -- SO, was not a problem, or because they ate from there, so more food stayed in -- of our portions, you know? So then it became, Laeuferin, we had enough food to dinner. We had food, we had water, SO we were saved. Only something accidentally could happen that --
  </p>
  <p id="1223">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1224">
   A: -- for some reason -- because anything was a reason there, he had to send us to --
  </p>
  <p id="1225">
   Q: Now, are you saying that you did not know tsip -- Tsipi, Helen Teshauer in block four? So she was in that block --
  </p>
  <p id="1226">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1227">
   Q: You didn’t -- you never -- you never saw her?
  </p>
  <p id="1228">

  </p>
  <p id="1232">
   A: Just a half a block, half.
  </p>
  <p id="1233">
   Q: I see.

  <p id="1234">
   A: Because the Schreibstuber was, the office was, and then we had three a-a-and maybe five, maybe [indecipherable] no, maybe, not more -- no, for sure no hundred. Less than a hundred.
  </p>
  <p id="1235">

  </p>
  <p id="1255">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1256">
   A: I said no, I didn’t know, because they were sitting beside the -- behind their desk, so --

  </p>
  <p id="1273">
   Q: -- that you would be safe?
  </p>
  <p id="1274">
   A: Yes. No. I felt safe. I felt safe, but still I didn’t think so far, because as I said at the beginning, I was afraid, or I -- I thought that the last day they will kill us all, they will throw a bomb, or -- or I don’t know how [indecipherable] what way --
  </p>
  <p id="1275">
   Q: Right.
  </p>

  <p id="1280">
   A: When we came, the first day we’re in the sauna, everybody had menstruation, everybody, from fear, maybe [indecipherable] and that was --
  </p>
  <p id="1281">
   Q: No, but I mean in block four.
  </p>
  <p id="1282">

  </p>
  <p id="1287">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1288">
   A: Those which they worked with the [indecipherable] they didn't eat there probably, I don’t know, maybe sometimes, but that was not the main dish, but for me still it was the main dish. What I got extra was only extra.
  </p>
  <p id="1289">

   A: Yes, from --
  </p>
  <p id="1317">
   Q: -- send you --
  </p>
  <p id="1318">
   A: Somebody would come, anybody from the office, for me, and would say today you have to go there. Not always, when they needed somebody special, somebody extra, so they said f-first of -- for example, today you will go to Auschwitz -- to Auschwitz one, to the [indecipherable] you know that [indecipherable] to the Gestapo let’s say I think, they wear also uniforms. You will go there today. [indecipherable]. Or today you will go to the [indecipherable] when they had the lot of work. They sent always me, maybe -- maybe I spoke the best German, probably. You will go to that [indecipherable] to the other lager and so on, it was always accompanied by an SS to go there, to translate. So therefore I know what they did. So --
  </p>
  <p id="1319">
   Q: So you would translate from what to what?
  </p>
  <p id="1320">
   A: From Polish to German.
  </p>
  <p id="1321">
   Q: And you knew Polish?
  </p>
  <p id="1322">
   A: I knew Slovak and that is very --
  </p>
  <p id="1323">
   Q: And it’s enough -- it’s close enough.
  </p>
  <p id="1324">
   A: Close enough. Once happened they translated the Polish and -- and German and then SS continued. Hitler [indecipherable] spoke in Polish. I thought oh my God, how lucky I am that I didn’t say anything else. I didn’t instructed him also. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1325">
   Q: So was a lot of your work doing translations? Was that a great deal of the work?
  </p>
  <p id="1326">
   A: The work, yes, even they send, go there, go there. You know, it’s one block to the other one, everybody had to know German.
  </p>
  <p id="1327">

  </p>
  <p id="1367">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1368">
   Q: -- the people are being gassed.
  </p>
  <p id="1369">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1370">
   Q: These are not simply people who have died and are being cremated, this 1s a factory of killing.
  </p>
  <p id="1371">
   A: Yes. [indecipherable]. We were standing at the entrance, and in front of us, like you -- no, further, let’s say, opened the wagons, cattle wagons and stepped out people from there, and they were hurrying like [indecipherable], and they holding tight to their belongings. They were holding tight to their families, and they were hungry and they were thirsty and it was hot. Nearly, when they -- when the Hungarian came, this was the 16"" of May, hot. They didn’t have enough air, they’re smelling an-and shiny. Water was -- was running from the [indecipherable] that religious men were in these black caftans with beards and with hats. And two of them came to us, we were two at the entrance and said in Yiddish, that you are Jewish children, give to us water. They left everybody and they came to us. What could we have done? I went to the Ausen, and she was -- her name was Grese, Ausen Grese, a beautiful lady -- girl, a little bit crazy, but she wasn’t so mean. I went, I said -- and I had to report why they came to us, yes, was dangerous. So I said, these two men came and they ask for water. What can we do? We didn’t have even water. She said, don’t bother with them, because it could happen that they will take you also with them. So we were standing, looking at them, and didn’t say even anything. It was very sad, very sad to see so many people. And they had to leave their belongings, they had to leave the families because the SS said line up, line up. They were their prisoners also in these uniforms. They had to help with the belongings, their suitcases. But they ran all over among them, among the newcomers and they said -- they suggested, mothers with children, give over the children to the grandmothers. Men, you say that you are younger. Boys, when you are told, you say that you are older. When they ask you about your profession, you say that you have a trade in -- not in German I don’t know [indecipherable] they could understand each other. And the SS, they yelled los, los, and line up. So suddenly in five minutes they didn’t have their belongings, they didn’t have their families. Some mothers, they give over to their grandmothers, some kept them. They had to line up again, men to me -- with men, women with women. Women- mothers hold the children, and then came the doctor, and selected with one finger. He didn’t bother too much, he didn’t think too much. And so they came with a little wand, they took the sick ones first, yes, and then they took them. They didn’t know what happened to them. It was so sudden that they didn’t know what happened to them. And they were carried away. And some of them then came to the lager, but not right away, not right away, they took them some [indecipherable] place and then they came into. And in a short time you saw the flames. So that was very often a st -- we were so close, the crematory wasn’t far from the entrance. So often was there a strong smell of burned flesh and burned bones, very often, more often than not, from the burning people. Was very sad. They came, they came, it was time and they came and came. Never stopped. Was time and for weeks nobody came, maybe for a month, I don’t know, don’t remember. It was really when the Hungarian came, very often.

[indecipherable] good how good will it be to die now, nothing [indecipherable] nothing there.

  <p id="1381">
   A: Cause was so easy to take us to the gas chamber, we were some extras that time, the emptied A lager, they put it in a other one, and we left -- we were left behind to make order there. Made order, was ready, and nobody know, nobody took us.

  </p>
  <p id="1404">
   Q: Now were you also standing when they took the family camp, the Theresienstadt camp out to be gassed, were you there? Am I wrong, or --
  </p>
  <p id="1405">
   A: No. The -- it was during the evening, or -- late evening, summertime. Nobody was there, nobody was at the lager, nobody. Somebody came only from the office and told me, you have to stand between that -- not in the front. The -- the Theresien lager was cross the street from -- from Birkenau [indecipherable] lager. But between the A and B lager was a door, yes. Nobody was there, and from the -- as I said, from the office they -- somebody came, I don’t remember who, and said, you will stand today between A and B lager, that is your post in the evening. I didn't know the reason why I will stand there, so I went. I would have gone also [indecipherable] cause I had to when they send me. They’re sending -- standing, and as I said, nobody was in the lager, it was not permitted, because the guards stay there on the towers, and suddenly I heard a cry, and- and -- and -- and running around, and so -- and that was the time when they took the people from Terezin lager, or the family lager it was called. Because it was like that that this famil -- those families from Theresienstadt, they were together, and that was called family lager. And later on only when I am here, so I read somewhere that it was written on the -- on the wagons, SB, Sonder Behandlung, and that meant -- that what they write in the book, that meant that six -- for six months, or -- I think six months, they had to stay there as a family, and then they sent them. And that time, that evening, or that night when I was late night there, they -- in the morning I heard -- in the morning somebody said that they put them on -- on the -- on tracks, on tracks they put them, on car -- on tracks, they took them to the city of Auschwitz, and they carried them the whole night all over, to -- to -- to mix them up, that they don’t know where they are going, and then they put them in the warehouse, or somewhere into a place, I don’t know, I wasn’t there, and then they gassed them there, in some warehouse, or somewhere, a place. That was -- I wasn’t there --

   A: In Auschwitz, but outside of the -- not in the gas chamber. Outside of Auschwitz that time. Other times I don’t know, because they gassed them other times also. And then in the morning, or the next day I heard that in one barrack they found a place where a teacher was there, and he wrote down everything what happened in the lager that night. That what I know --
  </p>
  <p id="1408">

   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1411">
   A: I wasn’t there. I was standing between the two barracks, between two lagers, which didn’t have anything to do with Theresienstadt, only the noise. Maybe that nobody should be outside, but there were the guards. That I know about Theresiens --
  </p>
  <p id="1412">
   Q: But being outside and watching that must have been very upsetting.

And they -- somebody I think me -- somebody’s birthday was -- I don’t know whose, so they are order f -- ask her to play on -- on a violin [indecipherable] a violin she play. And she was a real big musician, because they played together with her father in Vienna, Austria. She married through Holland, so they b -- they s -- brought her from Holland, yes. She mentioned that sh -- her second husband was a Czech, because I said I am Czechoslovakian. And so -- so -- so they took her from this experimental block, and they brought her to Birkenau, and they made her as a [indecipherable] after [indecipherable] maybe. So she was playing with them. She had such a small stick, a thin stick play, and she used to complain that her stick 1s too heavy for her, and we used to laugh that this is heavy for Alma Rosé, and we use all equipment, we have to work and so -- so -- and she played beautiful. For Sundays sometimes, or more often, I don’t remember if every Sunday, she played by herself. I-I was young, and I-I didn’t go to these big places and so -- but I couldn’t imagine something nicer than she -- when she play -- when she play, and there came also high rank officers were standing around and playing -- and listening.

  </p>
  <p id="1441">
   A: Together yes, in lines, and she played with her orchestra. We had to tell them how to mar -- how to start and so on and so. And when they came and returned from work, they had to march also by we -- without orchestra when they return, I think without. We had to lead them, but sometimes we didn’t, when nobody was there from the SS. [indecipherable] She was ha -- she was a musician, oh mine God, never her [indecipherable] yeah and then she died. It was April the fourth, I remember. I remember it from -- from reading. April the fourth, 1944, when we heard Alma Rosé die. She was invited to a party and they said that she was poisoned there.

   A: Yes. No, I don’t know about the Hungarian woman, but I know about the girl that she survived becau -- 1t happened my -- my roots, you know, I met so many people there which -- which they belonged to -- belonged to me. I met a -- a b -- a -- a woman which was very handy there and very nice when I was Schreiberin, and said stay, and she worked always something other, I said, stay here, be a -- be a Stubendienst, yes, a servant here. And she stayed and worked and so [indecipherable] after my work and after the war I went to the city Koshitzer, and I met her on the street and she said, come, visit us [indecipherable] go to a restaurant, she said come, visit us and we’ll have supper with us. So I said, what’s your name and what -- I knew her first name -- I said what’s your name and what’s your address. So she said her name and I said, we have here a relative, who work there and there and there. She said that’s my so -- my brother-in- law. She was my cousin’s wife. And she told me -- I didn’t say anything to her but she told me about this girl that she lives in -- she has this cousin or something in California, and she mentioned her, described her, so she lived in -- in California, in America after the war. So I know that she’s --
  </p>
  <p id="1574">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1575">
   A: -- she survived, that my aunt survived -- she passed away now, this lady from mana -- from my husband, the three, I know that they survived. I don’t know about Koshitzer, I was in Koshitzer, I never asked about her, but I’m sure that [indecipherable] was healthy, and I don’t know about this Hungarian lady, I don’t know. But three I know.
  </p>
  <p id="1576">
   Q: So tell me the story about Vera Isen.
  </p>
  <p id="1577">
   A: I told you, no? With my father, aha happen, what happened.
  </p>
  <p id="1578">
   Q: No, you didn’t. What happened, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1579">
   A: I came to the -- came to the barrack and they were sending a nice looking girl, young, maybe 20 or so. I said -- and I knew that she’s not from the barrack, because I would know her. I said, “What are you -- are you looking for somebody?” She said “Yes, I am looking for Aliska Roth,” or for -- yeah. So I said, “Why are you looking for Aliska Roth?” She said, “Because she’s my cousin.” I said, “Your cousin, what’s your name?” Vera Isen. I said, “Oh, so what’s the problem?” I didn’t say anything to her, what’s the problem [indecipherable] wasn’t interest to talk too much. I said, “What’s the problem?” Said, “I am on 20 -- on block 25.” So I said -- I didn’t ask why, I didn’t know why she’s there. I said [indecipherable] afternoon, I cannot do anything, I will try tomorrow to do something. Come with me, I go with you to 25. Since I was -- before Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- people knew me, so I had some position. So I went there, there was a Slovak lady, older than -- she was a mother of a girl [indecipherable]. I said [indecipherable] didn’t ask who we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing. I said, ““Now this is my cousin and she’s here in your block.” It was impossible to take out from there. “She’s in this block, I want to help her, but today is no time because late. So I-I -- I will come tomorrow, so please hide her,” and I looked up there where the dished, and some storage. I said, “If something would happen during the night, place her there, send her there, she should hide there. In the morning I will be here.” She said okay. And I am wondering how she could do that, because she had her on the list, yeah. She says okay. So -- and I went in the morning there. I said, I came for my cousin. She says okay, so I took her. I took my cousin and I went with her to the sauna, because I knew that that time they were sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to work, you know, Philips and so on and so. They went there. And there was an SS, [indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me, because I was standing there. Her name was Ziatz, and I knew she’s a simple woman, older woman, in her 40’s, somehow, I never heard her voice, she must be a nice woman. So I went to her and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my cousin, look how beautiful she is, she is nicer looking than I am, I gave her some [indecipherable]. And she’s in -- the problem with -- with her that she’s in block 25. She has to go to the gas chamber. And she can go as a nice looking girl, then I can go also. I am not so nice looking than her. Please help me. Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to work. And she looked, and she said, leave her here. And I left her there, and I believed her, this [indecipherable] I left her there. And that’s it. And I had the feeling, that’s a good feeling, the girl is safe. After the wer -- war, when I came to PreSov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there, and we were so [indecipherable] saw me, knew the name. She said, I was in [indecipherable] with the -- they had a -- a grape garden. So I met there Vera Isen, and she said you should come there to pick up grapes. So I said, well I don’t know. But I knew that I will not go, I wasn’t the mood to travel with grapes, forget about it. And then I said, are you go back, tell her that I thank, that I’m here and I thank, and -- but I will not be here, I will be in Humenné, I go to my uncle. So then I received from her a letter. I’m not sure if I wrote her or she wrote me, that I don’t know. [indecipherable] was a little place, Humenné was also a little place, was enough to know the name, okay, [indecipherable]. So I received a letter that she’s with her brother there and they want to go to the States, to New York. But that time wasn’t permitted from Hungary to write to New York, wasn’t permitted somehow connection [indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote me the address to New York, I should wr-write in Hungarian [indecipherable]. So I wrote there, and that’s it. I never heard about her, never, never, never. After years and years my cousin from Koshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me that she -- she received a letter from Israel -- from Israel from my other cousin, that this cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and that Vera wi -- Vera Isen was there and she’s in this book about Auschwitz, and she said the story that the -- she was select -- she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn’t know that time that she had a sister and she had a mother there. And the other blockalteste came there, and managed -- because she was the last one, that they took her out from the line, and she put her sister or her cousin or somebody, this blockalte -- somebody instead her, and they took her from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin from Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherable] wanted my address where I live now, to tell me that she’s alive. So I wrote to her, but she didn’t write for a long time. So I said, when she doesn’t write, ask from Israel her address. [indecipherable] I -- I never said to her -- she doesn’t know the story of my father, that my father had her -- I don’t know what -- what kind of reli -- relative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so a few -- then she in -- then she invited me to Florida, I should come, I knew that I will not go. I said maybe. And then she called I shouldn’t go for January because her children are there, sh -- I should come for February. And I said, I will go rather to -- to New York. Then I had my hip operation, I said [indecipherable] called me, I said I -- I cannot go because I have a hip operation. Then she called me again, I said I want to go to -- to Washington first, and I will come from Washington, maybe I will come to visit you. I never went and she never called or never --
  </p>
  <p id="1580">
   Q: So you’ve never seen her since that day?
  </p>
  <p id="1581">
   A: No, I saw her only once. But then I wrote to the [indecipherable] my new cousin, my new cousin.
  </p>
  <p id="1582">
   Q: Right, right. Did you tell her when you brought her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your cousin, or you never told her?
  </p>
  <p id="1583">
   A: No, I told her, oh I -- I --
  </p>
  <p id="1584">
   Q: Oh, you did tell her.
  </p>
  <p id="1585">
   A: -- I -- no, I didn’t tell her I am your cousin, I reacted as I will help you.
  </p>
  <p id="1586">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="1587">
   A: Ira -- reacted as a cousin.
  </p>
  <p id="1588">
   Q: As a cousin
  </p>
  <p id="1589">
   A: Come, I will help you. But I never wrote to her that my fa -- what my father told me, that he lost his mother, who was an Isen.
  </p>
  <p id="1590">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="1591">
   A: And so I met a few ones. Some of my roots. A few ones [indecipherable] few ones.
  </p>
  <p id="1592">
   Q: So how do you understand yourself doing all of this?
  </p>
  <p id="1593">
   A: Yeah, I had other times also when I saved.
  </p>
  <p id="1594">
   Q: Yes?
  </p>
  <p id="1595">
   A: So -- but how I understand myself, after many years -- and I was happy that I could help. After many years I sometimes ask was it worthwhile. Who cares, nobody cares. If it 1s worthwhile to be a [indecipherable]. Then but sometimes maybe. Nobody said ever, thanks.
  </p>
  <p id="1596">
   Q: Nobody?
  </p>
  <p id="1597">
   A: Nobody. Nobody. So they were thankful it’s -- my aunt and the other lady, but I don’t know if it is worthwhile to risk your life, as I risked my life. I risked also [indecipherable] Polish -- I wrote it, Polish women. They wanted to take them to Visla to [indecipherable]. I mean, the SS came and he said where are -- I had to line up. It was a rec -- convalescent barrack where they didn’t go to work, they stayed there. And he came, where are they. Polish women. I said, we don’t have here Polish women. He left, but I had statistics, I had -- I wrote every day stat -- and they would say, show me your statistics. I finished [indecipherable]. He turned and he left.
  </p>
  <p id="1598">
   Q: And you had just faked everything?
  </p>
  <p id="1599">
   A: I didn’t faked anything, it -- my -- my book was there, my notebook was inside in there.
  </p>
  <p id="1600">
   Q: But he didn’t look.
  </p>
  <p id="1601">
   A: He didn’t ask. I looked so little, innocent.
  </p>
  <p id="1602">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1603">
   A: Yeah, [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1604">
   Q: But don’t you, even if people don’t thank you, you have some feeling in yourself about what you did.
  </p>
  <p id="1605">
   A: Yes, yes, sure.
  </p>
  <p id="1606">
   Q: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="1607">
   A: I know that I did the right thing.
  </p>
  <p id="1608">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1609">
   A: I do know that. I’m satisfied. I’m satisfied I did the right thing, yeah, even they don’t care, but sometimes I think that nobody -- no, I -- I -- a-always when somebody -- I did something for some, ask me what should I [indecipherable] I said, now you want to repay me? Yes. Give me a smile. It was always my reaction. Yeah, it was very risky. Once somebody saw me from the sauna, was also a -- some relative that I knew her before. And I went to the Schreiberin that time, I said, take her a -- take out her name, yeah. She said, find me a razor -- an eraser. So I went all over, I found the eraser, so she wrote through and erased, it should be so mixed up that she made the mistake. When I took her out, was evening. Then one Polish lady who was then my blockalteste when I was Schreiberin with her in the last barrack. She came to -- now you stole this girl, you took her out from the -- I said no, no, I didn’t. She said yes, I saw you. I said no. But then when I came onto her barrack, I said -- said, you remember that evening? I really took her. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1610">
   Q: But something -- something must have been in your family, there’s a certain kind of justice, or evenness, even what you did after the war, that even though this woman had no right to get money from you.
  </p>
  <p id="1611">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1612">
   Q: None --
  </p>
  <p id="1613">
   A: None, because --

  </p>
  <p id="1615">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1616">
   Q: -- so she wouldn’t say nasty things about your father.

  <p id="1618">
   Q: It was your responsibility.
  </p>
  <p id="1619">
   A: -- I felt.
  </p>
  <p id="1620">
   Q: And it’s a -- oh, there’s -- there’s something, something.
  </p>
  <p id="1621">
   A: Maybe that that my father was a very honest man, maybe. Maybe that. Maybe, I don’t know.

   A: And that’s -- I looked so -- I knew that I looked so innocent, a little girl. Who wouldn’t believe a little girl.
  </p>
  <p id="1632">
   Q: But you know, when you said -- when we were talking before, about having -- being practical.
  </p>
  <p id="1633">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>

And I had so -- so much courage that I said to the Lagerfuehr [indecipherable] was the Lagerfuehrerin. I said, Frau Lagerfuehrerin, is this possible, to work with children? Yeah. Maybe I wasn’t [indecipherable] and she said, for us is everything possible. Yeah [indecipherable] so I left, turned and ran. So after that, a few days later, somebody came into the barrack and said Mala 1s back. She stands on the entrance, she is on the entrance. She is back in lager. They brought her [indecipherable] from the prison. And then somebody said the other one -- I think that -- I think that Sally -- Sally was her name, Sal -- I don’t know, one was Herta, the other one was Leah, I think. But the third one, I think that’s Sallah, I don’t know. And that I don’t [indecipherable] that she went to -- to the entrance, and she gave her a razor blade, in case she has to cut her veins. And then was a whistle and all of us who was in the lager, had to go into the B lager to stand there. We were standing and they brought, I don’t know who came with her, Mala. She was there to [indecipherable] Mala is here. Wasn’t so simple. And there was the Lageralteste, and was a Scharfuerer [indecipherable]. Lageralteste Mandel, and Scharfuerer [indecipherable]. And Mandel, the la -- the SS Mandel, she said to -- the short speech, and she said, we got a message from Berlin, this Mala has to be put into a crematorium alive, alive.
  </p>
  <p id="1740">
   Q: She said that aloud?
  </p>
  <p id="1741">
   A: Aloud, for everybody. And whoever would escape, will happen for everybody. And then -- then Mala took the razor blade, and she cut her forehead -- forehand, yes, forehand like this, and turned her arm, and blood dripped from her, and with the right hand she slapped this thir -- yeah, and the thir -- the [indecipherable] she too -- he took razor blade from her hand out, so she slapped him, yes. And blood was dripping. And then he took her hand down and sent her I don’t know, I don’t remember who went with her to the [indecipherable] to the [indecipherable] to the emergency or something like that. They went with her, and we were standing there, and then she returned and -- and bandaged her forearm, and then I don’t -- don’t remember if [indecipherable] or there they put her in some carriage, and somebody pulled her out of the lager. And then in the morning we heard that when she arrived there was an SS man, and he said, oh that’s you. He recognize her, because they went out and -- it’s you. I will not throw you in the oven alive. And [indecipherable] we know that -- knew that from the Sonderkommando who worked there, somebody said that he gave her a pill, and -- and here, poison yourself. Or the mer -- there most probably was that he shot her -- I will shot her -- shot you first. And the third version was that she took a pill, that she had the poisonous pill. She killed her -- poisoned herself. And Edek was hanged.
  </p>
  <p id="1742">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1743">
   A: Edek was hanged [indecipherable]

  <p id="1746">
   Q: Tell -- explain what a Schreiberin is. That was your next job after the Laeuferin. What is -- what does a Schreiberin do?
  </p>
  <p id="1747">
   A: She has to have evidence of people, somebody’s placed to the barrack, somebody’s placed from the barracks. And nationalities, how many those, those, those, those, those, according, a list has to be put together, and to take to the Schriebstuber. Then we had a reconvalescent lag -- block. That meant some people, they -- which they were sick and they were not sent to the gas chamber, let’s see, the non-Jews, they were not sent to the gas chamber, yes. You are sick, you went to the Revere, to the [indecipherable]. And then they send them for a few day -- let’s say for three days or four or five, six days or [indecipherable] mostly to a reconvalescent block. And then you had to place them from the reconvalescent block according to regulations, back. And back from there they came, yes. So, when we had to send them back, we had to go to the same route as who was there when Mala -- was Mala, who me she slapped, for permission -- he had to sign that go to place, and so on. But again, I didn’t place back. [indecipherable] I knew when I was Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was his office. So I used to go to him, I said, Herr -- it was the Arbeitsfuehrer, something like that, please sign me, sign me this. And he used -- used to smile, so -- he didn’t look at me, only smiled, and signed, didn’t say anything. And I sent to the - to the sewing room, sewing, because there we were exchange for young -- for older people from Auschwitz. But the -- here was older people, so mainly older people came. So sent them there, or I kept them longer or so -- so we had to be in [indecipherable] maybe he didn’t know, maybe he smiled only like, I don’t know, I never ask him why he smiles, I didn’t care, he sign. So we had to be in connection with this -- this Arbeitskommandant. We had to go to the Schreibstuber, and the Zaehlappell had to be correct, yes, so that was -- now, and beside that, we help, from -- we order, and so food came, too. Sliced bread to -- and the portions of soup -- the stoup beans the -- the stew beans, they gave them food, but bread to prepare every evening again, so I would work around, there were many people in there. I don’t know how many hundreds of people sometimes in a block.

  </p>
  <p id="1771">

  </p>
  <p id="1772">
   Q: I don’t know when this happened, but at some point you said that an SS man visited the blockalteste’s room drunk, and was asking --
  </p>
  <p id="1773">
   A: Yeah. Yes, yes. Let me tell you this story.
  </p>
  <p id="1774">

   Q: No, this was another block, this was --
  </p>
  <p id="1777">
   A: That was when we left -- when we left A barrack, the A lager, and we left A lager when I said that we s -- we were there -- left -- we were there, only few girls yes, and I was scared, but we’ll have [indecipherable] to die, I was scared --
  </p>
  <p id="1778">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="1779">
   A: -- and so on, and so what will. So one day came an SS, and he took us to a other lager, to another lager, only by foot, it was close, yeah. And I came to this blockalteste, who saw me that evening that I took somebody from this road that was outside there, standing, here they were standing, and then -- but that’s interesting, that this girl became a woman, and she committed in Israel suicide. Whom I took from the sauna, you know it?
  </p>
  <p id="1780">
   Q: Yes, that one you took from the sauna?
  </p>
  <p id="1781">
   A: Which I -- the -- the other --
  </p>
  <p id="1782">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1783">
   A: -- Schreiberin erased her name, and so I took her from the sauna, she went to her [indecipherable] and I took her to the other one. She came to New York, she divorced her husband, left her son with her husband, went to -- to Israel, married again, and then she committed the suicide. Destiny, yeah. So the question was, this drunk SS.
  </p>
  <p id="1784">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1785">
   A: Yeah. So from there we went to the other and this blockalteste who saw me to steal her [indecipherable] I came there, and she said that she wanted a -- I wrote it there -- somebody as a Polish, a Polish woman, as a Schreiberin, but the other one, who worked with Katya [indecipherable] means miss, misses, yeah. She told me, the blockalte -- probably not [indecipherable] that I have to take -- she didn’t know me, I didn’t know her, we saw each other only this evening, yeah. She said that Aliska has to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was good to -- to save the Polish women, you know, from the Visla that she sent to the latrine, go to the latrine, then she’s got to be Schreiberin here. So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was the a-assistant blockalteste a Polish woman, a other one, they were sitting together, two Polish women. And I was with them, the Schreiber. It was -- I think it was late -- yeah, in October we came there, I think maybe in October, could have been winter or -- or so, 1t was cold, I know it -- we didn’t have a calendar there. I didn’t know the date, I didn’t know the day. Sunday we knew because we didn’t go to work. So, open the door and an SS man came into [indecipherable] room, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assistant, we had a little room, yeah. So we were sitting that time there, and this drunk SS came in, took off his hat, put on a chair and said -- put -- took off the gun, put on the chair and sit there and said, I will stay here with you, and I will -- I will sleep here on the floor with you, or I will go into the barrack and I will sleep on the bunk, the bunk [indecipherable]. I don’t leave from here, I will stay with you here. An SS. And this other -- the -- the assistant -- the assistant blockalteste, she was so strict to him, she started to spit on his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he was very, very drunk, and he said, I don’t want to live. And there -- therefore, I don’t want to go from here, I -- therefore, I want to stay here, because I am not worthwhile to live. I killed so many girls from Holland, Dutch girls. They were so beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, and I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw and I killed them, and they were so beautiful, and therefore I don’t want to live. Now we were scared. A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spitting on his head. That was tragic, yeah? So it -- what to do? So I didn’t say anything, and I left. I left them, and I went at the end of the lager was a office for the SS men. They stayed always there, I saw them to go into there, yeah. Never had anything to do with them. I saw them there. So I went into that office, to the SS office, and I said, we have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of his -- could you please come to pick him up? I didn’t say what he said, only that. And one of -- I don’t know, there were two or three there, I don’t remember. Maybe I didn’t notice, even. So he got up and he followed me again, came into our little room, took him, didn’t say anything -- he was scared when he saw him. He took him, and -- he took him.
  </p>
  <p id="1786">
   Q: Right.

We have a friend with my husband, we are every Sunday together, besides the other one who doesn’t know, but he is somehow a little bit mixing up maybe. He said [indecipherable] why do you go to -- to Washington? He said, oh they called her from museum. And then I started to talk about something else.

And he told me in the train, I was with your brother, I worked with him in the forest, and he run away when he heard that they take the parent of the people to help them. He said, and then I stayed there, I went again to work there, and somehow I met partisans and the partisans took me with him -- with them, and so I was saved. Was a smaller lager ne -- next to Lublin. And that -- that he was hidden. I think that he said that he knew from him, or the lady where he worked, but I don’t know who told me that he was hidden, and he came home when he heard that they took hi -- but he told me this story and it’s a true story.
  </p>
  <p id="1993">
   Q: Yes.

  <p id="2000">
   A: I don’t know, but I imagine that to Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="2001">
   Q: You think to Auschwitz?
  </p>
  <p id="2002">

  <p id="2003">
   Q: Yeah, yeah.
  </p>

  <p id="2015">
   Q: [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2016">
   A: -- a lot of shooting. I was al -- almost always among them, because I wasn’t enough strong to march. I had to lean on somebody. We were four girls.
  </p>
  <p id="2017">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="2018">
   A: For me it was the most difficult part.
  </p>
  <p id="2019">

  </p>
  <p id="2020">
   A: I couldn’t -- so they pulled me in.

  </p>
  <p id="2028">
   A: Yeah. It was there -- Wehrmacht -- Wehrmacht. Not everybody was bad, not everybody. I couldn’t say that everybody was bad. And when they -- it was a order to -- to -- to rest. And -- rest [indecipherable] and hi -- I had a -- a raincoat, a raincoat, a tin raincoat and it was very cold, 18" of January, and my shoes with laces, but they were narrow, they were not enough big. After the war I had an operation, a bunion operation, both of them, because they became so big my -- see this line here?
  </p>
  <p id="2029">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2030">
   A: And --
  </p>
  <p id="2031">
   Q: You had big bunions from those shoes.
  </p>
  <p id="2032">
   A: I think so.
  </p>
  <p id="2033">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2034">
   A: And frozen, too.
  </p>
  <p id="2035">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2036">
   A: I couldn't march. My hip. So when they said [indecipherable] I was lying -- I always lied down in this -- my raincoat in the snow, others also, but I always, see? And this SS, he was, I know from where, he was from Dusseldorf, Dooler, what Dooler? It will come to my name -- my memory, Willie Dooler from Dusseldorf, and -- a Wehrmacht, and he said get up, get up. I said no, I am so tired. He said, you will get a cold. I said, I don’t care. I really didn’t care, I so tired. [indecipherable] get up, get up, because when you will stay in the back they will shoot you. So somehow I managed. And so he was really often beside or behind us and he said go, go, go, go, so we went. He found us all the place to sleep, because some of them, or most of them, they slept in a barn, and he’s -- he found us a place to sleep in a house. Was a woman there, a Polish woman. He asked her to cook -- prepare us supper. She made us potatoes and ham -- and ham? Ham, yeah, potatoes and ham. And after so many years, we --we slept in a bed.
  </p>
  <p id="2037">
   Q: On the Death March?
  </p>
  <p id="2038">
   A: On the Death March, during the night. The other was in a barn. And I told him I want -- he -- I loved his approach yes, I saw that he’s so earnest. I said, I want to stay here, I want to hide. He said, if you want to, hide, but you take a risk because could happen that the Germans will -- will burn the village and you will burn with them. If you want I will give you bread. You can stay, but rather go on. It’s a risk to stay. So we went on and on, like him -- with him. And between there -- between this time, they -- they were shooting people [indecipherable] the most sad part which I saw was when I saw a woman lying and a ho -- a brain next to her. They shoot her through the brain. And then a other one when -- a woman, she was Italian, not Jewish, she was pregnant, and she was in my block where I was Schreiberin so she noticed me from somewhere on a higher spot, she was standing with somebody. And it made -- she made a impression that she is giving birth. A big stomach and so -- felling down and looking at me [indecipherable] but I couldn’t -- first of all, I couldn’t go out and I wouldn’t risk that I couldn’t do, and then I couldn’t walk myself. It was very sad, this marching. I had these tied shoes, and even th-that time were -- were not pantyhoses, only stockings, remember, and girdles, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="2039">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2040">
   A: And my girdle went into my flesh, so this was bleeding, and in -- in my flesh there. The girdle, and my shoes were tied, my -- my raincoat was cold. So we went.
  </p>
  <p id="2041">
   Q: And this was miles --
  </p>
  <p id="2042">
   A: Hm?
  </p>
  <p id="2043">
   Q: -- that you walked.
  </p>
  <p id="2044">
   A: I walked. Miles.
  </p>
  <p id="2045">
   Q: Miles and miles and miles in very cold January weather.
  </p>
  <p id="2046">
   A: Was very cold [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2047">
   Q: Did you have gloves this time?
  </p>
  <p id="2048">
   A: I don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="2049">
   Q: You don’t remember.
  </p>
  <p id="2050">
   A: I don’t remember. It was so difficult that some people managed to have some bread in the rucksacks. We had some material, we could -- we made ourselves some rucksacks, and they threw on the -- on the road, see loaves of bread. Because before, the day when we left for this march, somebody opened the storages, the bread storages and they were stealing bread, so some of them, but th-throwing everything, even -- even a little clothing, whatever somebody had, thrown. Everything was too heavy, was very bad.
  </p>
  <p id="2051">
   Q: Yes. So how many day -- do you have any idea how many days you marched til you got to the train that took you to Ravensbriick?
  </p>
  <p id="2052">
   A: Yes, I think that only two days because I remember two nights that we slept on the way, two nights, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2053">
   Q: Did you sleep two -- two nights in some --
  </p>
  <p id="2054">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2055">
   Q: So this man arranged on the second [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="2056">
   A: Yes, he arranged the first day, and then the second day he arranged in a house where on the first floor were sleeping SS -- not SS, soldiers, probably Wehrmacht, they were sleeping there. And we were upstairs, and he was so nice. We were two Jewish girls and two Christians. One of- probably was Jewish and she said that she is Christian because people said that she 1s Jewish, so I don’t know, but re-regularly were two and two. And he was so nice that he said to the two Christian girls, Polish girls, to tell us we shouldn’t say that we are Jewish in front of the soldiers or the people because that would be bad for us. We -- we wouldn’t say anyhow, yeah. Yeah, he helped us.
  </p>
  <p id="2057">
   Q: Were there people in the Polish population that saw you as you were marching?
  </p>
  <p id="2058">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2059">
   Q: Wi -- di -- did people say anything, did anybody give you anything?
  </p>
  <p id="2060">
   A: Yes. It was -- I wrote about it. In one village, I don’t know -- I don’t -- didn’t know the villages, I didn't know the times. There were a few women standing with buckets full of water and with little containers and they -- they passed on. I was on the other side, I didn’t get a water, but on this side, they -- standing, I don’t know, maybe 10 - 12 women, Polish women.
  </p>
  <p id="2061">
   Q: Standing there.

  </p>
  <p id="2071">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="2072">
   A: Probably first day because we were rushing, and so they could help --
  </p>
  <p id="2073">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="2074">
   A: -- they helped with water, and that was a big thing, a big thing.
  </p>
  <p id="2075">
   Q: It must have been important as a human being to see it, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="2076">
   A: Very important, very important, even I didn’t get the water, was very important to see that some people are nice, and they were not scared of the Germans, they gave us water.
  </p>
  <p id="2077">
   Q: Right, right.
  </p>
  <p id="2078">
   A: See that means water, when you don’t have it --
  </p>
  <p id="2079">
   Q: Yes, it may be more important than food in some ways.
  </p>
  <p id="2080">
   A: Yeah, more important for sure, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2081">
   Q: So do you get on a train to go to Ravensbriick?

  </p>
  <p id="2086">
   A: Yeah. Mm-hm, and in the meantime the men were there already, and probably they were the whole night there on the station, because they threw them ou-out, off the trains, frozen, like pieces of -- of wood. They take a piece of wood --
  </p>
  <p id="2087">
   Q: And throw it out? [indecipherable]
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="2095">
   Q: So were the women in better shape than that -- than the men?
  </p>
  <p id="2096">
   A: That time I think that they were --
  </p>
  <p id="2097">
   Q: So --
  </p>
  <p id="2098">
   A: -- because I didn’t see anybody, only what -- who was shot, but I didn’t see anybody through- through them, because we came and we entered the -- the train, the open wagon.

  <p id="2099">
   Q: Yeah. Right.

  </p>
  <p id="2102">
   A: -- so I had that impression that -- and somebody said also, among the men that they are very long here, I don’t know for how -- how many hours or the whole night, or so. And they got frozen there on the train, on the train station they got frozen because they arrived there, so they were there. But they couldn’t make it. After we left, we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin, was bombed that time. And the women said that they don’t know about Auschwitz. Girls ask, do you know about a place, Auschwitz, where they burn people? No. But then they took us to different places, train stopped, and we went further, further, because it was no place. Everything was evacuating from -- from pop -- from Poland. So we went, went til we came to Ravensbriick, and there started the other misery.
  </p>
  <p id="2103">
   Q: It was really bad there.
  </p>
  <p id="2104">
   A: Bad because no food, only the second day or third day some food, but we didn’t have containers. Only our friend Vera Kubario, she had some [indecipherable] containers she brought, and she gave us sips to take, we counted the sips. Now you will take five sips, now five, five, five. And once she hit me, because I -- now, she was nice, because I took small sips. Said, you will be hungry. Take bigger sips.

  <p id="2105">
   Q: Bigger sips.
  </p>
  <p id="2106">
   A: Yeah, that was [indecipherable]. We didn’t have place where to sleep, it was a big place. We sit down, we didn’t have even to -- to sit where. Legs one on the other one and so were very bad. And they didn’t let us in to drink water, the old ones said we -- we are bringing from Auschwitz pests. So you cannot come in. So we were drinking snow. Snow. In the morning was snowing, was snow. Through the evening when it didn’t snow, you see th-the -- the -- the earth, brown. So we ate the snow, and -- and this la -- ice-sicles?

  <p id="2175">
   Q: -- and families are gone from --
  </p>
  <p id="2176">
   A: Families are gone, you are alone, and you are not the same as the other ones who are fr -- who were free, you are not the same. You don’t understand each other. The values are different. They talk about different things. They are interested about different things. It’s not the same. And to fit in into the free world is not so easy. We are not the same. Not the same, because --
  </p>
  <p id="2177">
   Q: Can you explain that more? What were people talking about that you were not talking --
  </p>
  <p id="2178">
   A: It’s not in t -- because it is not interesting to us, but [indecipherable] for important. Not interesting for us, no. They will -- we will try, let’s see, let’s see, now I make it up. Let’s see they will dress up, or -- or they will [indecipherable] something expensive, or I don’t know. So it’s not interesting. We’re alive, so we have to survive and it’s not -- and they don’t take you as -- as the same. They take -- they think that you are different, yeah. They take all -- by myself I feel I am different from them now, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2179">
   Q: And did people ask you what happened? Did they care?
  </p>
  <p id="2180">
   A: Once we went to -- to a city. I met people on the -- on the way and so and so. We went through a city, that city was called [indecipherable] and one man from PreSov, I s-saw him on the street because I had the business on the same street [indecipherable] from me. But I talked to him and we went -- I kept with them, with him and with two friend -- two friends? Yeah, and with two friends. They went three mile and I was with them. And he took us to a house, to his relatives, to his relatives in [indecipherable]. And they gave me a room, and they had the other room. They were nice, they gave me a -- something -- something to wash up and so. And I heard how the woman, Jewish -- Jewish couple, older couple, a woman said to the man, did you hear what these girls said? They said [indecipherable] or they will be -- and he said, you don’t have to- to listen and to -- to -- to -- to -- listen to -- to believe her everything. You don’t have to believe her everything, what he said. And then I decided I don’t want to talk more about what happened there. That was very painful. I come to a first house --
  </p>
  <p id="2181">
   Q: And they don’t believe you.
  </p>
  <p id="2182">
   A: They don’t believe me, no.
  </p>
  <p id="2183">
   Q: So, did you stop talking?
  </p>
  <p id="2184">
   A: Not totally, but I didn’t say that I wasn’t no -- nowhere or so, but I didn’t explain, I didn’t explain. Maybe to my uncle, maybe like that. He -- he lost also ev -- some [indecipherable] yeah. No, I -- and since then I sometimes mention it for among people. I don’t want to talk about it because that time, right away, on the way, he said to her, you don’t have to believe her everything what she says. No.
  </p>
  <p id="2185">
   Q: You went back to PreSov, we talked about that in the beginning. And then you went to your uncle in Humenneé.
  </p>
  <p id="2186">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2187">
   Q: Yes. And you met your husband.
  </p>
  <p id="2188">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2189">
   Q: You met the person who became your husband, if you will.
  </p>
  <p id="2190">
   A: Yeah he came -- became his boss.
  </p>
  <p id="2191">
   Q: Yes. Why did the two of you decide to stay in Slovakia, or was there no choice, until ’68?
  </p>
  <p id="2192">
   A: Yeah. It’s a reasonable question. Life was good there. After the war, people were happy. They were not -- we were also to dancing, so still, if also [indecipherable] different who was there, not everybody was there, because not everybody returned, yes?
  </p>
  <p id="2193">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2194">
   A: But those who were there, they wanted enjoy life. So life was joyful and even the economy was good, because nothing was there more, so when somebody started business or so, so he made -- he was doing well, or -- or he got a job, or so. Nothing was there, everything was like a vacuum in Slovakia. People were missing, so everything had to be built again, so economy was good.
  </p>
  <p id="2195">
   Q: Wow.
  </p>
  <p id="2196">
   A: And it was also music, and it was -- here and there somebody returned, so they were happy, so they used to say, oh here will be better than in America, so I will stay here, yeah. But then slowly, slowly we realized that it’s not the same life than it was, because first of all, we missed our families.
  </p>
  <p id="2197">
   Q: I was going to say, it must --
  </p>
  <p id="2198">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2199">
   Q: -- must have been very difficult to be there.
  </p>
  <p id="2200">
   A: Yes, it was, it was. Well, it’s -- I married. I had the home, yes. I -- I wasn’t -- I didn’t have to be hungry. Was a reasonal --
  </p>
  <p id="2201">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2202">
   A: Now, I liked him. We didn’t go out, no -- nothing. He was a [indecipherable] and I was a -- and suddenly -- I was engaged to somebody. And somebody -- suddenly he asked me if I want to marry him, I said yes. But beside that, yes, beside that he was a -- was a nice boy, quiet boy and so, but I was happy that I have a home, yes, have a home, and I have somebody, somebody close. I needed somebody to talk. Somebody who would under -- who would be willing to understand.
  </p>
  <p id="2203">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2204">
   A: Who will be willing to listen [indecipherable] so it was not reason to go out. Then later on we wanted to go here. My uncle left for America, for New York, and he wanted me to come with him, he wrote to his relatives they should send me an affidavit --
  </p>
  <p id="2205">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2206">
   A: -- but they didn’t. And -- we have to stop, huh?
  </p>
  <p id="2207">
   Q: No, go ahead.
  </p>
  <p id="2208">
   A: And then my husband got an affidavit from his uncle, from Texas or from where. But affida -- and then he asked for me because we were engaged, til the affidavit came, we -- we worked on a passport. The numbers were very high in the States, yes, registration number. And til -- and he has his -- he had his store, his house and so on, til he deci -- he -- til he started to be -- to turn to the Communists. So til then we asked for the passport and we send the last minute the pa -- the affidavit to the consulate, to the American consulate, and it was late, was late, because -- because why? Because the numbers were high. So somehow it didn’t work, til we decided that we want to leave. So the numbers were late, and we stayed. And then it was impossible to go.
  </p>
  <p id="2209">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2210">
   A: For years. And then we left still, to s -- we came to New York in 1966. They permitted us for a -- for a visit. They believed that we will return. But we didn’t find that what we -- what we were looking for in New York. We stayed for two months, and we had -- had on jobs. So we didn’t have to -- where to sleep, we slept once here, once there, we have shift from place to place, yes. So we went back. And then we started again --
  </p>
  <p id="2211">
   Q: Again, right.
  </p>
  <p id="2212">
   A: -- and we came there, then we returned.
  </p>
  <p id="2213">
   Q: [indecipherable] to stop, yes?

   A: Yeah. End of Tape 10 Beginning Tape 11

   Q: Is it Alice or Alicia, which is -- which do you like?

  <p id="2220">
   A: -- regularly, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2221">
   Q: Okay. Do you have -- when you think about your life, do you think that Auschwitz changed you a great deal? Or how -- how do you think that -- be-besides the loss, I mean that’s clear --
  </p>
  <p id="2222">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2223">
   Q: -- that the loss is tremendous and there’s nothing -- but you as a person, do you think it changed you a great deal?
  </p>
  <p id="2224">
   A: Yes. I don’t find things so -- some things for s-so important than -- than many people, ye -- yes. I don’t find little things so very important. Things are which -- you will leave and they will stay and nothing will change. No, I -- I don’t know how I was there at that time, because I was so young.
  </p>
  <p id="2225">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2226">
   A: So I didn't have certain [indecipherable] for life. I didn’t have certain -- any [indecipherable]. I wanted to be well, I wanted to be happy, and that’s it. So I -- I didn’t have [indecipherable] I want this, this, I -- my values are this or this. But only for now, I -- I feel sometimes different from others in this aspect, that not everything is for me so important like for you here in the States, who didn’t go through these harsh times. And maybe I understand better people. I look for a reasons when somebody is not as I want to. So I try to find the reason why is he not, because I believe that everybody has some reason for his way, how he thinks, yes. And everybody is right, in his way, and that perception is different, but is a big value to you. Doesn’t have to be to me, or to others. And then, not everybody has the strength to -- to struggle the same way for life, yes. You will go for -- you want to be, let’s see, I don’t know, maybe you are the director of the whole museum or something, or a minister of -- of welfare, or something. And somebody will not have courage, or I will not have courage and you do it your way because you believe in your strengths and so somebody doesn’t believe, or you believe in -- in mankind, somebody doesn’t. You will risk your life for somebody, and some -- whatever. It doesn’t mean the other one is better or worse. That’s your -- your -- these are your values and your beliefs. Who believes and values the same thing, yes? You believe in this [inaudible]
  </p>
  <p id="2227">
   Q: So, it -- has it in some strange way made you more tolerant than you would have been?
  </p>
  <p id="2228">
   A: Yes. I think so.
  </p>
  <p id="2229">
   Q: That you’re easier on people, you don’t judge people?
  </p>
  <p id="2230">
   A: Yes, I don’t like to judge people.
  </p>
  <p id="2231">
   Q: Uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="2232">
   A: I like to understand people.
  </p>
  <p id="2233">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2234">
   A: And not to judge people. This the difference maybe, yeah. That’s a good evaluation.
  </p>
  <p id="2235">
   Q: Do you think you were not that way when you were younger, before --
  </p>
  <p id="2236">
   A: I say --
  </p>
  <p id="2237">
   Q: You don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="2238">
   A: -- I don’t know, because --
  </p>
  <p id="2239">
   Q: You don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="2240">
   A: -- I was nothing. I was nothing, I -- I wanted to be happy, I wanted to be nice looking, I wanted to be liked.
  </p>
  <p id="2241">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2242">
   A: I wanted to be -- to make something of my life. But I -- I didn’t have -- maybe somehow unconsciously I had these beliefs but I didn't know about it because I didn’t have to deal with real life. I went home, I have my food, I have my bed, I have my -- my love from my parents, from my family. So I didn’t -- didn’t have to speculate why it’s like that or like that. Life was simple. Was a [indecipherable] yeah, but I don’t -- didn’t have my own [indecipherable] and I have to make up my own [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2243">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2244">
   A: -- and that is [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2245">
   Q: But it’s interesting that such a brutal place as Auschwitz --
  </p>
  <p id="2246">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2247">
   Q: -- could somehow -- whether it brought out in you, or you simply made of who you were as a child and didn’t know it.
  </p>
  <p id="2248">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="2249">
   Q: Because clearly, certain values that you had came out there. You didn’t become a brutal person --
  </p>
  <p id="2250">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="2251">
   Q: -- in Auschwitz.
  </p>
  <p id="2252">
   A: No. No, I didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="2253">
   Q: So maybe in some funny way it didn’t change you. It changed the course of your life.
  </p>
  <p id="2254">
   A: Yes, could be.
  </p>
  <p id="2255">
   Q: But maybe it didn’t change your character.
  </p>
  <p id="2256">
   A: Yes, maybe not, maybe not.
  </p>
  <p id="2257">
   Q: It’s interesting.
  </p>
  <p id="2258">
   A: I didn't try to understand people, because I didn’t have to understand them.
  </p>
  <p id="2259">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2260">
   A: Yes. Didn’t have to evaluate them because I was a young girl, could I evaluate older people, for politics or something like that, no.
  </p>
  <p id="2261">
   Q: Right, right. But you did realize a dream that you had when you were a child, and that was to become a teacher.
  </p>
  <p id="2262">
   A: Yes, I wanted to become a teacher.
  </p>
  <p id="2263">
   Q: And you did.
  </p>
  <p id="2264">
   A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be a teacher. Not [indecipherable] so much to teach, but how to behave and didn’t succeed always, not all the students were good, but I tried, I tried.
  </p>
  <p id="2265">
   Q: And what did you teach? What was the subject for which you --
  </p>
  <p id="2266">
   A: My main subject was home economics.
  </p>
  <p id="2267">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2268">
   A: That is family living, that 1s what -- housing and design, that is nutrition and cooking and sewing and material. That’s my -- yeah. But in Canada 1s like that, that you don’t -- sorry -- that you don’t stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay? You teach it. So I taught many things. I studied mathematics, which I am not so good in mathematics, I couldn’t say, but I didn’t know [indecipherable] taught me, and even physics one time I had to teach, lot more. I taught many things, what they needed, yeah, so.
  </p>
  <p id="2269">
   Q: But what you were really teaching was [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2270">
   A: Well [indecipherable] that was family living, that means -- I studied human relations and family living see, for eight years at Magill to -- to make up my -- my -- my studies, yeah, for update my studies [indecipherable] what did I stu -- yeah, I had special education [indecipherable] and then I had there a teacher certificate and here I made the [indecipherable] three diplomas here. But they -- everywhere was psychologic, everywhere was psychologic.
  </p>
  <p id="2271">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2272">
   A: To understand people, that was my first thing. And I think I master this one, to understand people. I try evaluate people, and then to understand them. That is my main thing in life, toward people.
  </p>
  <p id="2273">
   Q: And what did you enjoy most about teaching?
  </p>
  <p id="2274">
   A: Mostly check. I used to say, you don’t like your -- your -- your day, think about the check. Or- or think about the -- some people work also in a mental hospital. But I -- I used to say really was -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one student understood me, if I changed only one student, then it was worthwhile everything to study, to teach and so -- to change them, to change them, to -- to -- to give them self confidence -- first of all self confidence, that’s very important. And self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living, to help them to make something about themselves. But then I saw that, that as soon changed, he didn’t believe in himself. Sometimes I gave him a better mark, and I implanted into him that he is good. And sometimes it worked that he believed in himself. That is the most -- that was the most important part to me. And they should respect people and so, but mainly self respect. I used to say, and you don’t respect yourself, nobody will respect you. That was [indecipherable] I believe that’s the main thing.
  </p>
  <p id="2275">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2276">
   A: Courage, self respect, self confidence.
  </p>
  <p id="2277">
   Q: Did any of the students ever ask you about your European past and where you were? Did they- any -- any of your students ever know that you were in Auschwitz?
  </p>
  <p id="2278">
   A: No, nobody.
  </p>
  <p id="2279">
   Q: No, nobody.
  </p>
  <p id="2280">
   A: Nobody. No.
  </p>
  <p id="2281">
   Q: And that was a very conscious decision on your part --
  </p>
  <p id="2282">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2283">
   Q: -- not to tell them. Do you think now maybe it would have been okay?
  </p>
  <p id="2284">
   A: I wouldn’t say.
  </p>
  <p id="2285">
   Q: You wouldn’t say.
  </p>
  <p id="2286">
   A: No, I wouldn’t say, because I have to be one of them. Nothing has to be in my life which would differ me, which would make me different, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="2287">
   Q: Uh-huh, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="2288">
   A: Cause they were not in Auschwitz. They have to deal with life how it is.
  </p>
  <p id="2289">
   Q: [indecipherable] is.
  </p>
  <p id="2290">
   A: How it 1s, they have to deal this way. It’s their [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2291">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2292">
   A: And they -- they have [indecipherable] to work out their life as it is [indecipherable] them up, no.
  </p>
  <p id="2293">
   Q: I would imagine you were a wonderful teacher.
  </p>
  <p id="2294">
   A: I was a good teacher.
  </p>
  <p id="2295">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2296">
   A: People liked me, yeah. Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the other side they counted on the that I am soft, maybe, right?
  </p>
  <p id="2297">
   Q: Right. Yeah, well --
  </p>
  <p id="2298">
   A: Oh that’s right, yes, I couldn’t say for sure I was so respected and so, but they liked me, and they trusted me, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2299">
   Q: Yeah. So is there anything that we -- I know you have all sorts of things 1n your life that we haven’t talked about, but there -- 1s there anything important about your experiences during the Holocaust that you want to talk about that we haven’t?
  </p>
  <p id="2300">
   A: Maybe about this lady, it’s amazing, the German lady whom I met. She was lageralteste. This was lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageralteste. She came, I met her, and she said that she was a lagerfuehrerin. In a lager she was an SS, and that she opened the door and she let out the prisoners and so she became a haftling. I mentioned her in my thing. And she -- and so she became a prisoner. Then I didn’t see -- see her too much. And we discussed with her -- I suppose I spoke to her, discussed about human relations, among human feelings, about beha -- humanly to behave. And she said, it’s very easy outside to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and according to -- to -- to rules, human rules. But here it’s very difficult, because first of all, we have to think about ourselves, yes. Was difficult. So that outside I am very -- she said, outside in the world, people move with masks on their faces. They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that they care about themselves. But here you have to talk, you have to think about yourself. So it 1s not so difficult that here you see the human being as it is -- as he is, as he is. There it is a mask. It’s a play. Outside, the world is a play, in lager --
  </p>
  <p id="2301">
   Q: It’s not like that.
  </p>
  <p id="2302">
   A: -- 1s the real human being. Y-You show yourself -- you present yourself as you really are. You don’t try to cover up yourself. However, who -- how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he presents himself. That’s the real life, that’s school.
  </p>
  <p id="2303">
   Q: And you think that’s true?
  </p>
  <p id="2304">
   A: That’s true.
  </p>
  <p id="2305">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2306">
   A: That’s true, that’s true. Yes, it’s very true.
  </p>
  <p id="2307">
   Q: So -- so, if that’s true, then was, in some sense, living outside the lager difficult, even though it was horrible in Auschwitz, there was something about it --
  </p>
  <p id="2308">
   A: No, nothing [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="2309">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="2310">
   A: There you learn how to face people, how to understand people, you search in them how they are and you take them how they are. You understand them how they are. Not difficult. [indecipherable |
  </p>
  <p id="2311">
   Q: But outside, it’s harder.
  </p>
  <p id="2312">
   A: Outside, well, there are people which they -- which they try to -- to -- to present themselves better than they are.
  </p>
  <p id="2313">
   Q: Right.
  </p>
  <p id="2314">
   A: It’s hard for them to change, they should be really as they think that they have to be, or they want to be seen. Understand that?
  </p>
  <p id="2315">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="2316">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="2317">
   Q: That’s the mask.
  </p>
  <p id="2318">
   A: That’s the mask. You have to take off the mask and --
  </p>
  <p id="2319">
   Q: Yeah, and be real.
  </p>
  <p id="2320">
   A: -- be real, yeah, and try to help and don’t wait anything for -- somehow for a -- a reward. Nobody has to thank me that I helped somebody [indecipherable]. I do it myself. I did it and it is, yes. No, it -- not for money, nor for favors, nothing. Yeah, you see [indecipherable]. And you cannot change people totally. You can adjust -- you cannot change too much, you have to try, yeah. You cannot change all that -- we say that you cannot change all that, well you change, you know, you cannot. Exterior, you cannot change, you have to change your other, yourself.
  </p>
  <p id="2321">
   Q: [indecipherable] yourself inside.
