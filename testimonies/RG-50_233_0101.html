  </p>
  <p id="151">
   A: I got very sick there. I had typhus. I fell ill, and lay in the pigpen. People lived here (showing), and went to the bathroom over there (pointing). I didn’t know, and I fell over there. I lay there, and one woman fell over my leg in the night. I moved -- she thought I was dead. I lay there among dead people. Then they dragged me out of there...no...1t turned out that they knew my parents -- they took me away...In this barn, the space was divided into little lots, one family here, another over there. They took me in, let me stay with them. I forgot to say that when they took me to work, they sent my husband’s parents to a different place -- to Obadovka- a different camp. I was left in Turkanivka aloe, they were sent away. All the time I was alone. And I never saw them again. They died there, in the other camp. The ones who picked me up knew my parents. I was like a member of their family.
  </p>

   Q: Now this is still in the camp, near the farm, right?
  </p>
  <p id="157">

  </p>
  <p id="161">
   A: Yeah, yeah, yeah...they buried 50 people every day in the camp. Then they allowed us to take an apartment somewhere...to live. They let us out of the barbed wire, to live somewhere in the village. We still wore the Jewish star.
  </p>
  <p id="162">
   Q: But were they guarded, they were just allowed...?
  </p>
  <p id="163">
   A: They already had stopped guarding us. But, we had to go every time to the Village Hall. There were Germans, Romanians there...we all had to go there. They took the men to work loading wheat into trucks---without pay.
  </p>
  <p id="164">
   Q: So they were allowed to take rooms in a nearby town? Is that what happened?

  </p>
  <p id="171">
   A: We were not released. We were still there. We worked on the kolkhoz, or wherever. When the war ended, that’s when they released us. When was that, 1944? Oh, the war hadn’t ended, but the Romanians came in and let us go, in 1944.
  </p>
  <p id="172">
