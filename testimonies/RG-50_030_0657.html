   A: My — my father was a carpenter, builder. He not only carpenting, but he did the — he build houses too. Wood houses. And, not only that, he made music instruments, cymbals and violin. And the one event that I remember, that he was constantly consulting with one Jewish guy, Mortkis(ph). Mortkis(ph) [indecipherable] 1-in Kretinga was that — who used to sell ice cream, the best ice cream. And I remember that he was building one violin, and my father. And that violin was later by my sisters given to the museum in Kretinga.

And that’s what — actually there was the — the contact with the Jewish people. And I know that he was, you know, we — we constantly — and he used to get matzo.

  </p>
  <p id="59">
   A: My father was nine years older than my mother. He was born 1886, yeah. He was a -— already a old man when he — when he married.

  </p>
  <p id="82">

  <p id="86">
   Q: What were the values that your father had? Was he a religious person?

   A: Very nice.
  </p>
  <p id="98">

  <p id="99">
   A: Very nice. Although we were — we were not rich. The father did not make much money, and the mother was working too; she was working in bakery. On market days she was selling baked goods, some — some — some baker. And so they — they — they — little struggle. But we, as kids, I remember that one ladies, when I met later, said, you kids, you were so nice dressed, that the best dressed kids is Jurkus family. Because the mother was kind of little more — more sophisticated. As a young, she was 1n the apar — 1-in Latvia. She was in Riga and LiepA@ja, and she spoke the language. April 30, 2012

   Q: Uh-huh, yeah. Were you close to your extended relatives: aunts, uncles?
  </p>
  <p id="147">
   A: Actually, not too close, because that — the brother who inherited everything, married a woman which we did not communicate. She was very possessive there, what she had. She didn’t like — she didn’t like my father and my father. When they used to come the market day to Kretinga to sell their products, and parked their horses in our backyard, she didn’t give us anything, not even egg, or soda. And then, they had the two sons. They had two sons, which were — the older son, my mother’s age.

   A: In Kretinga we had three taxis, and the one was — number three I remember, that that taxi was rented for the bapt-baptist of my younger sister. This was something. So — and then there were — there were some — some people that they had the private opel(ph) cars. And then there was the grafas, th — th —
  </p>
  <p id="198">
   Q: The grafas is the Count.
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: The — the Count — the — of the Lithua — the skabatches(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: Uh-huh, the Polish nobility.
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: Yeah, the skabatches(ph). He had the old — old car, and when he used to drive, we kids, we wou — used to run after. But the speed was that we were even faster than —
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Than the car?
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: — th-the car. And then after I— 38, he acquired a new car from America. That was, I think Dodge. Now I can — at that time I — I didn’t know, but that was very stately car. And they had — in church they had their — the-the-the — their pew April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="204">
   Q: Yeah, their pew, like in the pew.
  </p>
  <p id="205">

  </p>
  <p id="206">

  </p>
  <p id="207">

  </p>
  <p id="209">
   A: Oh yeah, oh we couldn’t even talk to — with the — with the higher people, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="210">
   Q: I see, so he wasn’t somebody the kids would —
  </p>
  <p id="211">
   A: That’s 1— my subjective opinion. And then, when the — we were — I kno — you want to go little bit further now, or —
  </p>
  <p id="212">
   Q: Sure, yeah, yeah, no —
  </p>
  <p id="213">

  </p>
  <p id="217">
   A: Now, when —
  </p>
  <p id="218">
   Q: Cause it’s — I’m — excuse me for interrupting for a second. It’s very unusual that there would be a town in Lithuania that has 7,000 people, that would also have April 30, 2012 somebody who 1s truly from the old aristocracy, the Polish-Lithuanian aristocracy. Not every town had such members.
  </p>
  <p id="219">
   A: Yeah, but that — that was a — considered a big one. They had the ponds, they had their — their own electricity. They had the big — and these were like serfs, all over. He controlled that, and there was the palace. Now they have [indecipherable] and — and museum and everything.
  </p>
  <p id="220">
   Q: So the town had a palace? The town had a manor?
  </p>
  <p id="221">
   A: Yes. The skabatches(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Okay, so he had actually —
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: They never stayed in winter, they used to go to Germany, I assume. And when the — when the — the first occupation, Soviet occupation, he was chased out, he left, and it was occupied by Russian soldiers.
  </p>
  <p id="224">
   Q: So his house, his estate, was taken over?
  </p>
  <p id="225">
   A: Yes, were taken over, the — the whole thing.
  </p>
  <p id="226">
   Q: But let’s — before we get to the war —
  </p>
  <p id="227">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="228">
   Q: — let’s just stay in pre-war Kretinga a little bit.
  </p>
  <p id="229">
   A: Yeah, pre-war. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="230">
   Q: So you have Count, Grafas di Skabatches(ph), who sounds to me like probably the — the — the highest ranking, if there 1s a high ranking person —
  </p>
  <p id="231">
   A: He — He was a — he — I would say so subjectively, that he was probably — considered himself higher than [speaks Lithuanian] tha — that —
  </p>
  <p id="232">
   Q: District —
  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: The region — the region director.

  </p>
  <p id="235">

  </p>
  <p id="236">
   Q: I see.

  <p id="237">
   A: But [indecipherable] was.
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: So was even higher than the mayor.
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: Yes. That comprised Polanga, Kartena and all around, that was like a — like Siauliai, like Taluciai, so-something like that. And so that is my opinion, because —
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Did he have children?
  </p>
  <p id="241">
   A: He — he had the children. He had the — I think two sons and one — and one daughter. I cou —I could go later, you know, how we interfaced with that — with the daughter, but that was already after — after the Germans occupied us.
  </p>
  <p id="242">
   Q: And do you know whether or not they spoke — what language they spoke amongst themselves? April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: Not Lithuanian. Not Lithuanian. But I thought that he knew Lithuanian, but the documents which — when Soviet Union took over there aur — Russians took over the palace, some parts were transported to Kretingos muziejus, Kretinga museum, like music — mu — written music, and some other items, which nobody took. They were delivered to mus — museum, where we happened to live, there.
  </p>
  <p id="244">
   Q: Mm-hm. So, did you live in the center of town?
  </p>
  <p id="245">

  <p id="246">
   Q: I see, uh-huh.
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: — further on a — on a east — east part of the town. The Kretinga was kind of — the square in Kretinga, the marketplace was square. It was west, south — west, north — west, north, east, south. And probably we go later —
  </p>
  <p id="248">
   Q: Mm-hm, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="249">
   A: — because I have mentioned in my — in my article, how the ci-city consisted.
  </p>
  <p id="250">
   Q: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="251">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="252">
   Q: Were — was it such that within Kretinga — ah, I know what I wanted to ask you. What was the main economic basis for life in Kretinga? You mentioned that the Count had an estate and that people worked there. Did — did that estate produce anything? April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="253">
   A: They produced for the — for — for the Duke, for the grafas, and they were very independent. He sold the goods, and whoever worked there, they had no land, no nothing, just work.
  </p>
  <p id="254">
   Q: Well, what kind of goods were produced?
  </p>
  <p id="255">

   A: Self-sustaining. E-Exactly the same like the Catholic church.
  </p>
  <p id="260">
   Q: Also self-sus —
  </p>
  <p id="261">
   A: It was a big Catholic church, it was a cloister, it was a seminary. They were independent, too. They — actually they — you could say now that were three entities. There was the ci — the town, the church and the grafas.
  </p>
  <p id="262">
   Q: I see. Well, that’s unusual. Not every town would have so many — you know, would have —
  </p>
  <p id="263">
   A: Probably not.
  </p>
  <p id="264">
   Q: Yeah. And the town itself, what was the economic basis for the town? They — what did the town —

   A: Were factories like carpentry, ki — producing furniture. Bricks. The brick factory was a big one. And then agriculture. All around the town there were that — farmers, who lived in a— in a town, but had the land all around.
  </p>
  <p id="268">
   Q: Well tell me then now — let’s go to another aspect of life; and that would be the different groups and nationalities. We already mentioned a little bit that the — the Count, or the Duke was high nobility and the family did not speak Lithuanian. How would you describe the nationalities that lived in the town, was there more than one?
  </p>
  <p id="269">
   A: Yes.

  </p>
  <p id="293">
   A: Prussian, but this — we-were called in Lithuania, even that, who was a Lutheran Evangelical. It was Prussas(ph).

Was very good — very good acquaintance with my family. Used to come always and talk. Was just a — the kids probably did not associate so much with the Jewish kids. And that is a reason which I would like to tell, just very shortly.
  </p>
  <p id="464">
   Q: Sure.
  </p>
  <p id="465">
   A: Because the Catholic church is very much at fault.
  </p>
  <p id="466">
   Q: How would you say, how do you explain this?
  </p>
  <p id="467">
   A: When the priest for religion lesson comes in, and by — on occasion tells the Catholics they all will go to heaven, the Lutherans to purgatory, the Jews to hell. Priest.

   Q: At home, did anybody ever talk about the Jews, or the Lutherans, or the Provaslavs(ph), the Russian, or the [indecipherable]?
  </p>
  <p id="479">
   A: Between us, w-we — probably just small talk. Could be that we — Mother mentioned that she — she has to go there to — to that, and work, or — or — or on a market day, there are Lithuanian herring barrel. There is the Jewish barrel, there is some other barrel. You know, whose barrel is better, or something like that, th-the [indecipherable] or the herring.

   Q: Mm-hm, right. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="481">
   A: So But otherwise, no. But with the father, about the violin, about the instruments, and how he used to tell what Mortkas(ph) 1s telling. A — Mortkas(ph) was probably more educated, and he used to give hints to my father. I know that one time, he wa — already ending that, he had to take the head off of that, and make another head.
  </p>
  <p id="482">
   Q: For the violin.

  <p id="485">
   A: Friendly, friendly, friendly.
  </p>
  <p id="486">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="487">

  <p id="492">
   Q: A hundred grams.
  </p>
  <p id="493">
   A: Hundred gram or something like that, he used to go to tavern. And I — I remember that my — my mother was always angry that he stopped sometimes. April 30, 2012 Jewish people I have not seen drunk. So that — we knew that. And so — but the Lithuanians used to [indecipherable] to drink. And we, the kids, we — we didn’t had much. Playing, I know that my friends used to play there, because they lived together. There was a Jewish family living — couple Jewish families on — on the Kestucio gatves.
  </p>
  <p id="494">
   Q: Mm-hm, Kestucio Street.
  </p>
  <p id="495">

   Q: A butcher shop?
  </p>
  <p id="497">
   A: Butche — butche — bu-butcher shop. And they lived together with Jewish family. And then was — used to be laba — very interesting that Jews used to call us, the kids, to slaughter their chickens, because they couldn’t do that themselves. So they say, hey, come on and make that. And I know —
  </p>
  <p id="498">
   Q: Have you slaughtered a chicken?
  </p>
  <p id="499">
   A: I have not, but my friends there, they did. They did.
  </p>
  <p id="500">
   Q: Oh, I can’t imagine it.
  </p>

   A: And you know, but I was not — that was f— for — kids were — naturally, you — you — you want to experience so many things that — that you don’t take that — that as April 30, 2012 — as — as cruel or so. And then — and th-that was the same — the same backyard, with Petrauskas(ph). And Petrauskas(ph) were Lutheran. Lutheran communicated much better with — with — with the Jewish than the Catholics. So I —
  </p>
  <p id="502">
   Q: Why would you say — why would that be?
  </p>
  <p id="503">
   A: The religion.
  </p>
  <p id="504">
   Q: You think, yeah?
  </p>
  <p id="505">
   A: Religion. Religion is the — you see, I’m [indecipherable] Katalikas and I — from the beginning I — I — very early I recognized that the religion is very detrimental to our relationship with every — everyone else.

   Q: How sad.
  </p>
  <p id="507">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="508">
   Q: How very sad.
  </p>
  <p id="509">
   A: Because that is — that — that’s — that — you cannot associate. My first wife was Lutheran, my daughters are Lutheran, and my cousin said, I cannot be cuma(ph), I cannot be godfather. He went to priest and asked, the priest said no way. Can you imagine? But that was later, now, in the United States —
  </p>
  <p id="510">
   Q: Yeah. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="511">
   A: — but — but this was — this is — which I — you know, I’m — I — I could tell bishop or — or a priest, right in his face. I had lot of with — with the priests to do, and I was a chauffeur in Germany with one priest, and — and —

  </p>
  <p id="520">

  </p>
  <p id="540">
   Q: To wear the hat —
  </p>

  </p>
  <p id="543">
   A: No, I— I don’t think I was al-alone, I was with someone. And some — some other boy, or some man was. No, they — they invited, they invited that. There was the relationship with the Jews, was little bit odd, but was a friendly. Was a friendly to — we let them — because the Jews themselves, they wanted to be separated. I would not say they wanted to integrate. There was a like a s-state in a state. They had their own. And the government, or th-the mayor, let them do what they want. They could expand, they could build, they could — they could have. They had all the licenses for April 30, 2012 stores, for everything, for — for like a — a — what is that shop, you know, where — where you do the — the iron — iron work [indecipherable]

  </p>
  <p id="620">
   Q: What — let’s go a little bit towards outside life in Kretinga. What was the sense of the place that you lived in, this Lithuania that you lived in? How — how much did you feel it, how much do you think others felt?

  <p id="622">
   Q: Yeah, I mean, what kind of a — what kind of a politics did you — did people talk about politics and world events?
  </p>
  <p id="623">

  </p>
  <p id="624">
   Q: And what’s that? Who’s that?
  </p>
  <p id="625">
   A: That the name, Grigolyte(ph). And he was very much Nazi. And I remember that, even that — the Smetonas(ph) like I — ’39, before the Hitler took over, he used to argue with my father — my father. They were already their time. And my mother’s sister suffered very much. They didn’t speak Lithuanian. In Klaipeda, in that time, the kids were almost the same age like my family, and they really — and I used to — we used to go to Klaipeda very often. You know, Klaipeda was the — the — that was the city of — of envy. Everything was in Klaipeda. Even the smell was April 30, 2012 the — the factory smell was g — was good, the smell. And I used to argue with that — that villis(ph).
  </p>
  <p id="626">
   Q: Your cousin.
  </p>
  <p id="627">
   A: My cousin. He was a year older, and we used to sleep in one bed and kick each other, one for Smetona, one for Hitler. That time I already knew Germany, what is going in Germany, because Klaipeda was very much for Adolf.
  </p>
  <p id="628">
   Q: Tell me, how far was Klaipeda from Kretinga?
  </p>
  <p id="629">
   A: 24 kilometers.
  </p>
  <p id="630">

  </p>
  <p id="631">

  </p>
  <p id="633">
   A: Oh, what — half an hour with the train.
  </p>
  <p id="634">
   Q: Half an hour with the train. So, very close by.
  </p>
  <p id="635">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="636">
   Q: And what kind of a city? Tell us a little bit about the city of Klaipeda.
  </p>
  <p id="637">
   A: Was a harbor city. Was fisherman city. Was — everything was subsidized by Smetona. Smetona give so much money to every Nazi, to appease them. And even the Grigolytes(ph) got the place, new house. So that was — was odd thing going, what Smetona did. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="638">
   Q: Well, do you know about those policies? I don’t know anything about them, what were these monetary policies?
  </p>
  <p id="639">
   A: Well, because they — Klaipeda —
  </p>
  <p id="640">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="641">
   A: — for Lithuania was like a punishment for all intelligentsia when they — in Kaunas they do not fit. So they will — will send to Klaipeda.
  </p>
  <p id="642">
   Q: You mean if you’re a government official?
  </p>
  <p id="643">
   A: A government official, a professor or teacher, or some other activist against Smetona.
  </p>
  <p id="644">
   Q: They — they sort of exiled them to Klaiped —
  </p>
  <p id="645">
   A: They exiled to Klaipeda.
  </p>
  <p id="646">
   Q: And why is it a punishment? Why would it be a punishment?
  </p>
  <p id="647">
   A: Because Klaipeda was little bit odd. Klaipeda was not Lithuania. Was more German. The culture, everything. Lutheran. All of Klaipeda was Lutheran. So that’s my — that’s my — that I—I didn’t mean anything — that’s my impression, and I think I am right. There were the — the — the — a friction.
  </p>
  <p id="648">
   Q: So was it German Lithuanian friction?
  </p>
  <p id="649">
   A: The German, Memelland. Memel — [indecipherable] minor Lithuanian friction.
  </p>
  <p id="650">
   Q: So — April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="651">
   A: Because the Lithuanians, they do not accept the kla — the Memellander as a full Lithuanian.
  </p>
  <p id="652">
   Q: And why wouldn’t they?
  </p>
  <p id="653">
   A: Lutheran.
  </p>
  <p id="654">
   Q: I see. And is that why they were more pro-Nazi than Memellander?
  </p>
  <p id="655">
   A: And then many, many —
  </p>
  <p id="656">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="657">
   A: — Klaipeda ci — Klaipeda citizens were sympathizing with Hitler. Hitler promised many, many things, and it was easy for him to take over the Klaipeda 1939, what was March, or whatever.
  </p>
  <p id="658">
   Q: Do you remember that time?
  </p>
  <p id="659">
   A: Oh, I remember.
  </p>
  <p id="660">
   Q: Where were you when it happened?
  </p>
  <p id="661">
   A: I was in Lithuania, but I think I was in Klaipeda not lo — not long before that. Klaipeda was — because we had the relatives, we always associate, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="662">
   Q: So, you — do you remember the day when you heard Hitler took over? Not really.
  </p>
  <p id="663">
   A: Oh yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="664">
   Q: Oh, you do? April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="665">
   A: Oh, the day I don’t remember, but to — it was uproar in a — 1n a — all Lithuania, especially in Kretinga. There were exodus from all the Lithuanians, who ran with the buses, with cars, with — with horses, ran to Kre-Kretinga.
  </p>
  <p id="666">
   Q: So you had this onslaught of people?
  </p>
  <p id="667">
   A: Yes, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="668">
   Q: And did they tell you about what was going on? Did they tell stories of what was happening?
  </p>
  <p id="669">
   A: We knew that. We knew that, we didn’t like that.
  </p>
  <p id="670">
   Q: What did you hear, what did you know? Because we don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="671">
   A: So that Hitler took over Lithuania, part of Lithuania. That’s like — like Polish and Vilnius, exactly the same. We in school — you know, in school in ’37 - °38, we were already enlightened about the politics with Vilnius. Every morning in — in grammar school, we stand up, we look at east, and we say [Speaks Lithuanian]. We will not be satisfied without Vilnius. So with Klaipeda, when Klaipeda was taken over, Klaipeda is ours.
  </p>
  <p id="672">
   Q: And yet it was taken over.
  </p>
  <p id="673">
   A: It was taken over.
  </p>
  <p id="674">
   Q: And what — April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="675">
   A: And my mother’s brother stayed there. And then repat — repatriated when then was exchange between Lithuanians who were German descent went to Germany, there was th-the — the treaty between Soviet Union and Hitler —
  </p>
  <p id="676">
   Q: Okay, tell us a little bit about that.
  </p>
  <p id="677">
   A: — where they exchanged.
  </p>
  <p id="678">
   Q: Well see, I don’t understand any of that. Please explain it all.
  </p>
  <p id="679">
   A: Oh. It was 1940 - °41.
  </p>
  <p id="680">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="681">
   A: Already Hitler took — no, 1940. 1940, when the first Soviet occupation.
  </p>
  <p id="682">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="683">
   A: At one time, Germany agreed with Soviet Union, they will exchange.
  </p>
  <p id="684">
   Q: Exchange what?
  </p>
  <p id="685">
   A: The Lithuanians from Klaipeda or from Germany, who are Lithuanians patriots, want to come — [break] — Lithuania back, who stayed there. They didn’t like the Hitler regime, they wanted to come to — to Lithuania, and the Lithuanians, whoever knew what the Soviet Union brought us, they claimed that they are Lutherans, they are Germans, they claim that they have relatives someplace, and they could prove to the Soviet government, they were let out. And that was the exchange, repatriation, what you call in Lithuania. And my mother’s brother, April 30, 2012 Tarmynas(ph), came from Klaipeda to Kretinga. And then he was — because then he was trusted Soviet citizen, let’s say, he was given a position in kedainai(ph) or someplace. And we say, why do you do that? He couldn’t understand, he didn’t want to live under Hitler. But we knew already that.
  </p>
  <p id="686">
   Q: So you —
  </p>
  <p id="687">
   A: There are two devils; one is brown, one is red. And to choose between two devils, you rather would choose the brown. That time, really I’m not lying, that time was already evident that the Soviet Union was cruel. Because immediately, you remember, when they took the — immediately they de-deported so many people and everything, so that —
  </p>
  <p id="688">
   Q: Okay, we’ve gotten ahead of ourselves a little bit.
  </p>
  <p id="689">
   A: Oh yeah, little bit, okay.
  </p>
  <p id="690">
   Q: But — so the first time that I sense that their — that this world that you describe to me in Klaipeda has a huge change, is when Hitler takes over Memel and klai — the first time —
  </p>
  <p id="691">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="692">
   Q: — yeah, that Kretinga, the world that you lived in gets changed, 1s when Hitler takes over the port city of Memel and klai— Memel and German Klaipeda, and Lithuanian — April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="693">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="694">
   Q: — and there’s an exodus of Lithuanians coming to Kretinga.
  </p>
  <p id="695">
   A: The first exodus —
  </p>
  <p id="696">
   Q: The first exodus.
  </p>
  <p id="697">
   A: — before Hitler’s army marched in, they knew that they will march in that and that day, so that all the Lithuanians, where they could, they got everything — they could take everything what they wanted, they went to Lithuanian side because they knew that after Hitler will take over, or that Germany will take over, that you have no choice then.
  </p>
  <p id="698">
   Q: Okay, so here’s another question, when those Lithuanians came, and I said, well what did they say, and you — you said, well, that Germany’s taken over, I’m going after more of, let’s say their experiences, their details, where they were, did they have discrimination in work, did they ha — were they —
  </p>
  <p id="699">
   A: On what time? What — what —
  </p>
  <p id="700">
   Q: Before Hitler takes over ger — Klaipeda, what was the experience of the Lithuanians living in Klaipeda —
  </p>
  <p id="701">
   A: In Klaipeda?”
  </p>
  <p id="702">
   Q: Yeah, with Germans who were so pro-Nazi. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="703">
   A: That there was division already in the town. There was already, probably year before, was known for politicians that Klaipeda will be taken away because the war around, they were taking Czechoslovakia, they’re taking there and there and there, that Klaipeda will fall anyway.
  </p>
  <p id="704">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="705">
   A: It was known. What the people there — and there were already th-the Lithuanians were discriminating — the Germans were discriminating, the Lithuanians already in Smetona’s time.
  </p>
  <p id="706">
   Q: In what way?
  </p>
  <p id="707">
   A: A — not talking Lithuanian in stores, and the government was quite dominated by — by German — by [indecipherable] that — that means the — the administrators.
  </p>
  <p id="708">
   Q: Mm-hm. What about — did you hear about how Jews were being treated in Klaipeda’?
  </p>
  <p id="709">
   A: I have no idea. Ma — I think that Jews had better time in Klaipeda than probably in Lithuania in — in the gross Lithuania.
  </p>
  <p id="710">
   Q: In larger Lithuania, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="711">
   A: Because Jews integrated very, very nice with the Germans, because they speak the language — they spoke the language. Now, you would not recognize, is he a Jew, or is he a— a German, because they spoke perfect German. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="712">
   Q: But when Hitler came, was there a change there? Did you know —
  </p>
  <p id="713">
   A: I don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="714">
   Q: You don’t know.
  </p>
  <p id="715">
   A: Oh definite — definitely there was.
  </p>
  <p id="716">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="717">
   A: There was — I — I think every Jew ran out. Oh, I don’t think that anyone — anyone stayed. They knew what — what is to become.
  </p>
  <p id="718">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="719">
   A: They knew that, th-there’s no — no — there is no question.
  </p>
  <p id="720">
   Q: And do you know how Jews in Kretinga were reacting to all of these events?
  </p>
  <p id="721">
   A: With fear. With fear. It was — we knew that — and I think that the grown-ups knew already that — that wartime, that we will not exist from one, or from another. From one side or another si — east or west. But we kids, we didn’t know. We kids, we didn’t know, we just sensed that there is a tension, there is a tension, there is a tension. The parents always talk, what will happen to the kids, what will happen to us, how they will live, how they — how their future 1s. Like always they — they are elderly, they are talking and worried about the — the future generation, how will we survive when the war starts, and so on. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="722">
   Q: Yeah. Well, ’39 is pretty late, you know, when — and when — it’s sort of like the beginning of all these different events. So you recall —
  </p>
  <p id="723">
   A: It was already wartime.
  </p>
  <p id="724">
   Q: Yeah, in — in — in Poland, yes.
  </p>
  <p id="725">
   A: Yeah, Poland was already occupied September, and some other countries that — Denmark and — and where —
  </p>
  <p id="726">
   Q: Well —
  </p>
  <p id="727">
   A: I—I don’t know now — now th-the dates.
  </p>
  <p id="728">
   Q: I think tha — Klaipeda, I believe, was taken over in March ’39.
  </p>
  <p id="729">
   A: March ’39.
  </p>
  <p id="730">
   Q: And so half a year later, war is declared on Poland.
  </p>
  <p id="731">
   A: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="732">
   Q: And — and then Poland is quickly occupied.
  </p>
  <p id="733">
   A: Yeah, Danzig was then —
  </p>
  <p id="734">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="735">
   A: — before that all. There were so many events, so many events, y — 1n order to remember, I had to sit and then to sort out what was happening.
  </p>
  <p id="736">
   Q: Okay. Now in — in — in the fall of 1939, you’d be 12 and a half years old.
  </p>
  <p id="737">
   A: Yes. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="738">
   Q: Do you remember the next huge political changes of — of what happened after that?
  </p>
  <p id="739">
   A: So — Soviet occupation.
  </p>
  <p id="740">
   Q: And what happened? Tell 1t — in your life, not — not necessarily in —
  </p>
  <p id="741">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="742">
   Q: — the country’s life, but in your town —
  </p>
  <p id="743">
   A: In —1n Soviet occupation. No, we knew that — knew that before the occupation, that in a spring there is always a evening service in the Catholic church —
  </p>
  <p id="744">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="745">
   A: —1in May. And everybody goes to the evening service, and my friends, they used to go there. I — I— we used to skip — I used to sing, I used to sing good, and I liked to sing. And in the church, the — the — the songs are very, very, very beautiful, and very sound — sound nice, and so. And that time the kids, they said y — do you know Pranas, what is going in s — in Russia — in Russia that time, not Soviet Union, in Russia, in Ukraina(ph). What is going in — in Soviet Union, or in Russia, how the churches are prosecuted that time. We — we — we didn’t believe, as a kid, that — 12 and a half years old. And we heard already rumors. And then when the final occupation came, or invasion, the first invasion in — 1n the summer of 1940, we knew. And when we saw the soldiers. There is so much written about that. April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="746">
   Q: Yeah, but tell us, tell us what you saw.
  </p>
  <p id="747">
   A: When we saw that, when — and y-you know, when they came to Kretinga, they already marched through all Lithuania. We have to consider they were hungry, dirty, smelling, makorka(ph). And that’s what I saw. You know, that — the story, Lithuanian story, how the Jewish people accepted them with open arms.
  </p>
  <p id="748">
   Q: You saw this?
  </p>
  <p id="749">
   A: I saw myself. I saw the flowers, which is — it becomes so, you know, shablone(ph) now to talk about that, but that was.
  </p>
  <p id="750">
   Q: What do you mean by shablone(ph), please use —
  </p>
  <p id="751">
   A: That — that is already so mu — so much talked about.
  </p>
  <p id="752">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="753">
   A: So much put on the plate every time for the Jewish people.
  </p>
  <p id="754">
   Q: Okay, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="755">
   A: You accept it, you — you wanted that. You know, I understand, I — now I understand, that time I understand. You always side with somebody who treat you better. This is n-natural. This is your preservation, my preservation. If the German was better to me, I would go to German. If the Soviet would be better to me, I go to Soviet, so. In that time, we were disappointed. As a kid, we were disappointed that April 30, 2012 — with the armaments what they brought, with that — that everything — how they behaved, how they were dressed.
  </p>
  <p id="756">
   Q: How did they behave?
  </p>
  <p id="757">
   A: Most Mongols, you know, from — from Mongolia, the Russians.
  </p>
  <p id="758">
   Q: Well yes, but how did they behave?
  </p>

   Q: Well, you know, the sense I’m getting — and it’s a very macabre, also horrifying sense, but there’s this juxtaposition — you talk about yourself as a young boy as being very curious, you know, that you like to go out into — into the town, into the — into the area, kind of see what’s going on. And — and you’re 13 years old, 14 years old when — when you see the — the remnants of what the Soviet prison had, and you see this hand, and you see the chains. How much of the — were you frightened, or were you more intrigued, or were you terrified? How did you —
  </p>
  <p id="1270">
   A: You just kind of [indecipherable] it. You just kind of — neither. It did not hurt me s-somehow. Although, I had the feeling that if you inflict pain to somebody else, think about yourself. How would you like if somebody takes you with the hand, and turns around? I was always aware, cognizance of that — that I don’t want inflict pain to anyone, because I know that it will hurt me. So that I was just indifferent looking. 110April 30, 2012 And I was not alone, there were some other people. Sunday they go and look, because that — the Germans encouraged us, or the — the local government encouraged, look what the Soviets has — have done.

  <p id="1279">
   Q: Yeah.

  <p id="1280">
   A: And now that place, there is another side. That place, the Germans took over, three weeks or — or two weeks or three weeks after the war, everything is quiet, the gover — it — civil — German civil government, there is Nazi regime. You cannot talk what you want, you cannot — you have to be just —
  </p>
  <p id="1281">
   Q: Careful.
  </p>
  <p id="1282">
   A: Careful. We got to stay in line for bread, stay in line for this. There is no food available. Again you — you go and you fish someplace by farmer, or whatever you 111 April 30, 2012 do. It was — there was a shortage of food. And — but otherwise, nobody prosecuted. Church is free. Church is half burned, but we go to the church. The altar 1s still there, organ is gone. We go to church, the Germans did not forbid us. We are singing all the songs. German do not interfere. So we — we just live. It seems everything is fine. Now, every Sunday, you know, after the turmoil which we lived through that, and the front, and the Soviet time, after that, people used to go for a walk in the city, in that city, even was burned, but used to walk around the marketplace. And there was a beautiful park, Varninas(ph), because there were so many crows. We call —

And one Sunday, rumors. It will be something, it will be something. Some Jews will be paraded. Paraded Jews, where?

  <p id="1296">
   A: —man. Able body. They’re hiding. They were hiding, and they were rounded up one by one and put downstairs in the prison, in Antano(ph) Namalas(ph), where the Lithuanian patriots were 1-imprisoned. You see how that —
  </p>
  <p id="1297">
   Q: Same place.
  </p>
  <p id="1298">
   A: Same place. Now they said people come and look at those who — traitors who escaped. And then, people stopped because they — they parade. In German we call Spazieren.
  </p>
  <p id="1299">
   Q: Yeah. 113 April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1300">
   A: — in Lithuanian spazierohity(ph). Yeah. And they stopped, and the kids and I and some other people, and we stopped, and we say, what they will do? And suddenly, there come a car, German, like officers, SS and some soldiers, and finally they chase out, out of the prison about 16 young Jewish man.
  </p>
  <p id="1301">
   Q: How did they look?
  </p>
  <p id="1302">
   A: They looked with suits, still nice dressed. Some probably already tortured. They come there and they had to run around, you know. Was announced in German, we did not understand. Nothing Lithuanian. And now we — all the Lithuanians are looking. Suddenly, they take sticks, they take belts, they take longer guns, and these people are running around, and they started to hit them. Jesus. They started to hit, and they go around, around, you know. That takes about five minutes, 10 minutes. The blood is already going.
  </p>
  <p id="1303">
   Q: Are they screaming?
  </p>
  <p id="1304">
   A: They’re not screaming. Probably they didn’t know what — what happened. You know, is better to be shot than to torture like this. Okay, they run around and — and it seems that the Germans, so viciously, more to inflict pain — okay, people are looking, looking, and all the masses — not masses, let’s say hundred people from both sides, because that was round.
  </p>
  <p id="1305">
   Q: So 200 people. 114April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1306">
   A: I could even make a picture there or —
  </p>
  <p id="1307">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1308">
   A: I mean, not the picture, but I could make a scheme how it was, to — to eliminate more — e-eliminate more. Now the grown-ups suddenly started to leave. Where they watching, they start to leave. They don’t want to see. Like us, we want to see what’s — what — what — what will happen.
  </p>
  <p id="1309">
   Q: You’re kids.
  </p>
  <p id="1310">
   A: Yeah. Kids and some — some other — some people can, some people cannot. Now, I cannot imagine. People start to disappear, and — and they start to, about half an hour, the people hit, when they cannot walk any more, when they fall on that, and they pretend like they are dead, the other prisoners have to take them, and put in the pond, 300 feet away in the pond, where I — to revive.
  </p>
  <p id="1311">
   Q: Is that a pond where you used to ice skate?
  </p>
  <p id="1312">
   A: Yeah. They had to revive. Now, when the — the people who cannot, you — they are all dead, they want to drown themselves. They go in the middle of the pond and [indecipherable] the others ones have to pull them out, and again the same, the same.
  </p>
  <p id="1313">
   Q: Round and round and — 115April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1314">
   A: Round up. The one who is half dead, was thrown in that well for construction materials, the lime and the building material compounds, they were half -— still left when they build the — the house, in that — in that — 1-in the well, in the ditch. And then German came with a revolver, with a pistol and shot.
  </p>
  <p id="1315">
   Q: And you saw all this?
  </p>
  <p id="1316">
   A: Is—I saw. I saw that. Now —
  </p>
  <p id="1317">
   Q: It — this must have been — you saw a murder. The first time in your life you saw somebody being murdered.
  </p>
  <p id="1318">
   A: Yeah, murdered. Now, is still left let’s say 10 or — or — or 12, or three, or — all in — already in the well, ditch, dead. Until they almost couldn’t walk, they were so tortured. And suddenly announce that wi — these who are left, and who we will catch in the future, will be perform next Sunday.
  </p>
  <p id="1319">
   Q: So they don’t kill them?
  </p>
  <p id="1320">
   A: They put everything there, everything is over. The town 1s in astonishment. Nobody talks, nobody talks. Everything is quiet, the Joy is over. Go home. The kids, sure we ran to see what is in the ditch, what is in there.
  </p>
  <p id="1321">
   Q: What do you see?
  </p>
  <p id="1322">
   A: Vo-—we see all full of — of — o-of dead people. There were six or — or — or — or more, I — I do — I don’t remember, you know, one, another, and so. 116April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1323">
   Q: Was it the first time you saw a corpse?
  </p>
  <p id="1324">
   A: Yeah. And then, okay, then we leave that. They left one soldier to watch. One German, simple soldier, not of those, you know, Nazis.
  </p>
  <p id="1325">
   Q: And you know those were — these were Germans who were doing this?
  </p>
  <p id="1326">
   A: Germans, only Germans. Only Germans. Wa — tha-that’s what I emphasize. If would be a Lithuanian, I would have said, yeah, there was that and that. Which I could say who was that instrumental then wa — 1s two —
  </p>
  <p id="1327">
   Q: From those —
  </p>
  <p id="1328">
   A: — ou-out of the four.
  </p>
  <p id="1329">
   Q: From the four that you’ve mentioned to me before?
  </p>
  <p id="1330">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1331">
   Q: We’ll talk about that later.
  </p>
  <p id="1332">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1333">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1334">
   A: Now — and that is over. It’s already late, about six o’clock probably and everything is quiet, you know. I go home, my father doesn’t want to talk. He didn’t go. My mother didn’t go, my sister didn’t go. And you know, they say why do you go there, why do you stick your nose there? Okay, I — I stick. And now is over, next day, in the evening already, the city farmers, who lived li — outside little bit, with 117April 30, 2012 the horses and wagons, they are called next morning to take the dead ones and bring to the Jewish cemetery.
  </p>
  <p id="1335">
   Q: So they’re ordered to do so?
  </p>
  <p id="1336">
   A: They were ordered. And we knew that — that — that in the morning early, we were — [break] — we were there already looking. What — what they — how they will do.
  </p>
  <p id="1337">
   Q: What did they do?
  </p>
  <p id="1338">
   A: That — you know, the — the — the farmers, they — the Germans offer them a fork, with a fork to take a body. The Lithuanians, they wi — say no, we don’t want. We take two — two — two men, one body, and we put in a — 1n the wagon, there were three wagons, I think, and we bring that. They di — they refused that. Now — and they bring to the Jewish cemetery and they bury there. Okay, now what I heard. Then the farmers started to tell. The couple guys were still alive, and when they — when they took the body, he resisted, or he wanted — wanted to choke, tha-that was told, I was told. He wanted to choke. Now I am thinking that could be true, because in the evening, we saw some breathing, but we didn’t say anything. I — I saw some — some like breathing. It was —
  </p>
  <p id="1339">
   Q: The evening before.
  </p>
  <p id="1340">
   A: Even before, in the evening. 118April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1341">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1342">
   A: It could be that was still alive, but I didn’t see that [indecipherable] was choking.
  </p>
  <p id="1343">
   Q: So if I can understand, the — the — the — the men who were in the pit, who were supposedly dead, were taken out the next morning, and the one who was still alive wanted to choke the one who was taking him.
  </p>
  <p id="1344">
   A: Well — well, yeah, to choke.
  </p>
  <p id="1345">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1346">
   A: Or reflex or whatever —
  </p>
  <p id="1347">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1348">
   A: I was just —
  </p>
  <p id="1349">
   Q: Of course.
  </p>
  <p id="1350">
   A: There was a rumor.
  </p>
  <p id="1351">
   Q: Of course, of course.
  </p>
  <p id="1352">
   A: But I did — did — deducted or detected —
  </p>
  <p id="1353">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1354">
   A: The — only — only I, that yes, we saw that one was — or two were breathing, were still alive, although was already put in that with all the lime and — and everything. That could have been. That could have been. But this is — the fact can tell only that 119April 30, 2012 the farmer who was — no — and — and that was — was quite — and the city was terrible — terrible atmosphere in the city, and — and just depressed, people depressed. People could not believe that the Germans could do that.
  </p>
  <p id="1355">
   Q: And were they — did they talk about it?
  </p>
  <p id="1356">
   A: They talked just — just very mute.
  </p>
  <p id="1357">
   Q: Very quietly then.
  </p>
  <p id="1358">
   A: Very quietly. They — they didn’t want to talk. Nobody wants to talk about anything that time. The kids, we talked that we saw that and that and so on. Now, that time when they ended, they announced that next Sunday the same. Now, not to extend th-the story, next Sunday was the same. The same people down. There is an- another probably 30. They caught another bunch of hidden people. And the ones who were already dirty, with — with — w-with the — with the wounds, with everything, and I saw how the German, with — with — with sword, cut one, the ear was hanging here, I saw that. You imagine, how could I live not — not putting this to history? Was hanging. I don’t know if th — he survived or not, but that time when they ran around. Now the people came and you could detect which one was torture already, which came with the nice suit, nice shirt and everything. And after a half an hour, they all looked the same. The same scenery, the same torture, the same beating. Now, if the same soldiers beat, I cannot tell. I don’t recognize that — that — 120April 30, 2012 the Germans. All uniforms, and only was summertime, and you know how they were —
  </p>
  <p id="1359">
   Q: What color were the uniforms?
  </p>
  <p id="1360">
   A: Greenish. Infantry. Infantry SS. Not the black.
  </p>
  <p id="1361">
   Q: Okay, and so they weren’t — and they weren’t regular Wehrmacht? As far as —
  </p>
  <p id="1362">
   A: Not the regular wehr — regular Wehrmacht, only about five were guarding around, because, you know, they feared that could escape, could run or — or — or jump someplace. And second time. Now, second time, there were no people looking. Germans were angry, and I think they told through the translator that — why people don’t want to see those vertrai — those —
  </p>
  <p id="1363">
   Q: Say it in German.
  </p>
  <p id="1364">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1365">
   Q: Those what?
  </p>
  <p id="1366">
   A: Those [indecipherable] that — that’s — no — criminals —
  </p>
  <p id="1367">
   Q: [indecipherable] okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1368">
   A: — or criminals or whatever, who — you know, who — who e — ate you before, who torture you there. And so kids came, some other came, we would watch again.
  </p>
  <p id="1369">
   Q: You were kids. 121April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1370">
   A: I— yeah. We ah, kids or — or — or teenagers, or — and the same, little bit shorter — [phone ringing]
  </p>
  <p id="1371">
   Q: Excuse me for a minute. I’m so sorry. I should have turned it off, but I will — Q2: Do you want me to pause?
  </p>
  <p id="1372">
   Q: Yes, please. Q2: Okay, pausing. [break]
  </p>
  <p id="1373">
   Q: I’m sorry for the interruption. Can you tell me the second time you saw these events, you say the Germans were angry that no —
  </p>
  <p id="1374">
   A: There were no spectators.
  </p>
  <p id="1375">
   Q: That’s right.
  </p>
  <p id="1376">
   A: Or lack of spectators what they expected.
  </p>
  <p id="1377">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1378">
   A: They expected — that is my assumption — they expected there would be, you know, enjoyment to everyone. Enjoyment? You see what enjoyment, you know. You torture animals, you don’t have enjoyment. Anyway, and the same procedure. Reviving was dragged into the pond and back, revived and beaten, beaten, beaten until they couldn’t walk or so. And I remember that time, I don’t know if I was until the end or not, they were again put in the prison, and supposed to be third Sunday. You imagine, every Sunday was spoiled for all the Kretinga that — that walk, the 122April 30, 2012 people’s enjoyment, with that kind of things. And I didn’t see that — the third one, I don’t remember. And if I would remember, I would repeat the same. Is irrelevant now, that — that — that — but some told me that even was just a few people, the fourth Sunday. I — I don’t know. I mention in my writing that — that somebody claims, but I— I don’t — I don’t want. No — and — and that was over, and all what I have seen. But I —
  </p>
  <p id="1379">
   Q: And then — and then you as — do you assume that then if they weren’t killed during this kind of torture, then they — tho-tho-those who survived were simply shot later?
  </p>
  <p id="1380">
   A: Shot later. No — no one survived. No one. If they didn’t die there at the place, the torture place, they died in the prison. They — they were not fed, they were not — not —no — not care, nothing. [indecipherable] yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1381">
   Q: And did you n — did any of the people look familiar? Would they — did you know to — nothing.
  </p>
  <p id="1382">
   A: Not one man, not — not one. Probably some — some recognized, but I don’t.
  </p>
  <p id="1383">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1384">
   A: I—I didn’t recognize any one.
  </p>
  <p id="1385">
   Q: The second time when you were there, you say it was only kids, and maybe some teenagers. 123April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1386">
   A: There were some people too, there were some people, but —
  </p>
  <p id="1387">
   Q: Grown-ups.
  </p>
  <p id="1388">
   A: — not that masses, not like the first time —
  </p>
  <p id="1389">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1390">
   A: — that everybody do — what — what — what will be there. Because that — that —
  </p>
  <p id="1391">
   Q: Was this —
  </p>
  <p id="1392">
   A: — sa— sane people cannot stand it.
  </p>
  <p id="1393">
   Q: Well, here’s another question. You say that — you say that — that they ruined the Sunday, you know, the — the Sunday walk. But was that the reason why people didn’t talk, or — or was it that they were horrified?
  </p>
  <p id="1394">
   A: Horrified. I— I would assume. The — now I’m just speculating, I’m guessing.
  </p>
  <p id="1395">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1396">
   A: They were — they were stunned that why they should do that? The first [indecipherable] they were put in the — in the — in the ditches and shot, and that’s it. You know, that — that’s something else, but the torture. And you know, like si — little bit — little bit e-e-ex-ex-exploring that, the NK VD, or the — the Russians tortured, but Germans don’t torture. They exterminate, but they don’t torture. But why they — why they wanted this one — and I don’t believe that such a — such a program was anyplace else. I have not heard, and like Eidintas did not write? 124April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1397">
   Q: He’s an historian, right?
  </p>
  <p id="1398">
   A: Yeah. And nobody else has published like that.
  </p>
  <p id="1399">
   Q: Have you ever heard —
  </p>
  <p id="1400">
   A: Why someone who was, that time of — in the 20’s, in 25 or so, they knew that, Kretinga knew what was happening. I’m not the only one who witnessed that. Why nobody else comes? Why nobody el — calls Pranas, your article is interesting, I — I have seen. No. No one. It seems that I’m li — like a — like a liar.
  </p>
  <p id="1401">
   Q: You feel that?
  </p>
  <p id="1402">
   A: You know, I was disappointed. I was disappointed with you a little bit, you know, that you don’t call. Because I said why? Because no Lithuanian was participating. This atrocity, done in Lithuania, in my hometown, and done by Germans.
  </p>
  <p id="1403">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1404">
   A: Ca-— to show Lithuanians. You know Lithuanian, there were Lithuanian tortured my Germans, too, oh, concentration camp and everything. Oh yeah, Lithuanians, especially in Memelland, in — in — in — who had something to do with the — the process. That was in 1936 —
  </p>
  <p id="1405">
   Q: Oh, you mean the trial against the Nazis.
  </p>
  <p id="1406">
   A: The trial a-a-against Neumann and Sass, yeah. 125April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1407">
   Q: What do you know about that?
  </p>
  <p id="1408">
   A: I know from history only.
  </p>
  <p id="1409">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1410">
   A: Yeah. But from — they — somebody could have responded to me more. Couple guys call me and say, ah Pranas, you know, oh, everyplace happened that. So I know, tell me. And I — I —I showed the big book. And the big book, nothing. And I —I| think you s — you told that there is something about Kretinga in the museum archives, something similar.
  </p>
  <p id="1411">
   Q: Well, I heard — I saw some information. There’s not much. There’s not much.
  </p>
  <p id="1412">
   A: No, but not s — not such a thing which I’m telling now.
  </p>
  <p id="1413">
   Q: No, not that
  </p>
  <p id="1414">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1415">
   Q: Not that, not that. Now —
  </p>
  <p id="1416">
   A: And I—I—I-—TI want to tell that. I want to tell that — that, you know, somehow is a part of that tragedy which we have not solved yet between us, between Jews and Lithuanians. And I always see still the articles, or the accusations and this and that. No comment. I want to give what I have seen. You judge.
  </p>
  <p id="1417">
   Q: I want to find out from you, after these events — after these events, ho-how is the atmosphere in the town? 126April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1418">
   A: Just terrible. Terrible.
  </p>
  <p id="1419">
   Q: In what way”?
  </p>
  <p id="1420">
   A: Just terrible. You imagine that Kretinga should be the now atop of the world in such atrocities. Well, there’s not. There’s a Kaunas fort, Fort Five, or whatever.
  </p>
  <p id="1421">
   Q: The Ninth Fort.
  </p>
  <p id="1422">
   A: Yeah. Was there more? Was there more? No, they were shot, were shot. But not such a thing. And I could give you the — the — the place, the — where the people were, where the torturing were, how it was, how the pond is. I could draw you a— a map.
  </p>
  <p id="1423">
   Q: Tell me, when — the second time you went, and you came home, did your parents still not want to talk about it? Did you tell your parents what you saw?
  </p>
  <p id="1424">
   A: They didn’t ask me, they didn’t talk. Becau — I — we were very free Lithuania. We - the parents used to tell, be for lunch, but where you go in summertime, what you do — we didn’t work, you know.
  </p>
  <p id="1425">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1426">
   A: School, we didn’t ne-need to work. Soviet time, we had to work in a— in a— the Skavaches(ph) — the Skavaches(ph) garden. But by Germans we didn’t have to work.
  </p>
  <p id="1427">
   Q: So you could run around and play? 127April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1428">
   A: We- we play, yeah. Teenager already, 13 - 14.
  </p>
  <p id="1429">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1430">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1431">
   Q: Did you talk amongst your friends?
  </p>
  <p id="1432">
   A: Not much. Not much. It was — it was assumed that you saw, I saw, there is nothing m — no-nothing more to talk. Nothing more to talk. A tragedy. I don’t know how — how to describe the tragedy. In this age, when — oh, when I tell you, I—I could say that tragedy the top of the world, but that time? Event of the day. Event of the day. Cruel, yes. Like I say, if somebody h-hits me or — or — or pokes me, it hurts me. I know that people hurt. The people hurt, but there was such a notion that guilty, guilty. Who is guilty? No one is guilty, guilty ta — the one who 1s doing that.
  </p>
  <p id="1433">
   Q: What I’m trying to get a sense of, is how did it work inside of you when you see this? Were you numb, were you sh — were you terrorized, were you stunned, were you —
  </p>
  <p id="1434">
   A: I was terrorized, I was — at that time?
  </p>
  <p id="1435">
   Q: At that time.
  </p>
  <p id="1436">
   A: At that time I was neither terrorized nor stunned. Astonished little bit that I — I witnessed such a thing, and it was inside me which I carried when I — I said I carried so many years. So many years, I had no one to talk, no one would actually — 128 April 30, 2012 would listen that. They would say, like I repeating, they would say, yeah, everyplace was. There was a this — this and — and — and that. But I never ex — I never heard anyplace else, how much I read and everything. Was all shooting, extermination, concentration camp. Some torturing most likely in — 1n a — in — you know, in prison, but not that open. Three or four Sundays, to show the little town. Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1437">
   Q: Was there a time when you wanted to talk and there was nobody to listen?
  </p>
  <p id="1438">
   A: Probably it was. I knew one thing, that I will not forget, and I will write. And I will write. Now I come to that. And I ca — and I see my age is going — you know, we're getting older, days are passing, and this event I will take to — to my grave? No. I told myself no. And then happened that I saw there a Captain Sporelli(ph) in the — in the film, and I start in the beginning for that, I say here is th - my — my clue or my incentive to write what happened in my country. And I start and I finish. And I say why this had to happen to us?
  </p>
  <p id="1439">
   Q: You first wrote about this publicly in 2010?
  </p>
  <p id="1440">
   A: 2010, November six.
  </p>
  <p id="1441">
   Q: And it was published where?

   Q: And it’s a Lithuanian language newspaper’? 129April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1444">
   A: Lithuanian language newspaper. I have given — I had given my script — [break] — for former editor, two years ago.
  </p>
  <p id="1445">
   Q: Two years before that?
  </p>
  <p id="1446">
   A: Before that. And I called stairdinas(ph) massacre.
  </p>
  <p id="1447">
   Q: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="1448">
   A: Slaughter. And the editor did not had time to read that or to give me a comments. And I was little bit unhappy when — when — when, and she never returned that to me. The one I wrote, I did not correct much. I only gave to my sister. My sister said, I was three or four years younger, I don’t remember much. She only remembered that she saw some torturing — Soviets torture Lithuanians. She was that, as a schoolgirl, put that — to look at that. She remembered that. Otherwise she doesn’t remember. Parent did not — they — parents did not talk. Should be kids on their own who — who would kind of search, think about, or whatever. And then that — then we only heard later, you know, what happened there, what happened there that 1941, what happened in Kaunas.
  </p>
  <p id="1449">
   Q: When you’re talking — now let’s go back to Kretinga and — [technical interruption]

  <p id="1452">
   A: No?

  <p id="1453">
   Q: We’re not done. No, no, no, because I want to talk about Kretinga afterwards.
  </p>
  <p id="1454">
   A: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1455">
   Q: [inaudible] So, you said that after this, people were quiet, they didn’t talk, they were stunned in the town. That you haven’t heard of anything else that happened in quite such a similar fashion elsewhere. What — did any — did life normalize at any point, or do you think Kretinga was changed forever?
  </p>
  <p id="1456">
   A: I think it was — was fairly normalized. Normali — the front was far away. There was already Kaunas taken, was Vilnius taken, the Germans were in — in Russia. German administration, the military administration was changed to — to civil German administration, although the lower echelons were Lithuanians, but was German. German regime. And you have to [indecipherable], you have to [indecipherable] because you don’t know. Some people were taken, deported.
  </p>
  <p id="1457">
   Q: To Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="1458">
   A: To Germany. Some girls who were a little bit loose, they were pointed out and the Germans took them to Germany. There were no mass deportations to Germany for work. Lithuanians were not in that category as Poles and Ukraini-Ukrainians and some other ones. Although there were Lithuanians who worked in a — in a — during the — the war in German factories. 131April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1459">
   Q: Did you — after this — after these events, these horrifying things that you saw, did you hear of more murders while you were in Kretinga? Those women and children, for example?
  </p>
  <p id="1460">
   A: Oh, oh, the children, I didn’t finish that?
  </p>
  <p id="1461">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1462">
   A: They were star — I don’t know when they started, and I don’t know when they finished, but I know they finished, definitely. They didn’t let them go. There was no in — no — no — no intention. And some people who lived there, not far away, although it was far away to [indecipherable] is that — that’s like a — like a free land. The Jewish cemetery was very isolated by woods, by trees, and so that nobody heard, nobody — nobody knew. And I think there were some incidents. You know, we still had German occupation for years.
  </p>
  <p id="1463">
   Q: But that’s what I want to find out about.
  </p>
  <p id="1464">
   A: Yeah. But that’s non-event. It was war. German nationalized what they could. They took cattle, they took pigs, they took horses, they took everything what they have with the — and 1941 was fine, 1942 the front started and east was going bad, that Lithuania was short of food, short of everything. Speculation was high —
  </p>
  <p id="1465">

  </p>
  <p id="1471">
   Q: You saw.
  </p>
  <p id="1472">
   A: They had no place to put them. The Ger-Germans were guarding. They were so hungry that they should grab something, or you know, their cabbage or something, and I have not seen. But I — they used to shot on spot. If you leave that, to grab that piece of whatever, carrot or whatever, they shoot.
  </p>
  <p id="1473">
   Q: They shoot —
  </p>
  <p id="1474">
   A: They want — yeah, they — they shoot the prisoner. They wanted to get rid. What can they do with the masses? There were thousands and thousands Soviet prisoners. What they did t-to them, all kind of rumors. Some were — let it go and work by Lithuania in the farms. Many, many. Later they returned to Russia. They were lucky ones, so.

   A: Not much, there was only reformation — reform in the school system. I started then from grammar school in 1940s, I started immediately on a second cla — high school, or secondary school. And then I — I used to speculate, I — I used to go to — to — through the border and bring to Klaipeda. You know, there was a border. You couldn’t cross that, Klaipeda and Lithuania, was exactly the same. It was a guards and everything. We used to go to the — secretly through that — to that with the — with the [indecipherable] with the si — with the pork, with ducks, bacon, goose, geese and bring back salt, sugar, thread, something like that.

  <p id="1539">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1540">

And peculiar, he was a [indecipherable]. In Germany, when I was in Germany, you know, and was studying there and — after the war, and we go from one camp to another camp in Germany.

And I see the mother of Tyonis(ph) and husband — wife of that Yosa(ph) Parviches(ph). You know, I know, but I don’t say anything. She invited to visit them. She probably thought I was young and I don’t know. When I came there and met that guy, he was already old. I met that guy, he didn’t want to see me, he didn’t want to talk to me. He sensed that I know his past. And I don’t know what happened to him, by all them [indecipherable]. I don’t know what happened, he died most likely. His son was in German — what was that — that work forces at — with trucks were going someplace. Was sent to Paris, the German time. And after the war was in Foreign Legion, you know what the Foreign Legion, that in — in —
  </p>
  <p id="1551">

Or the Skutakalis(ph) were the — the one who — I don’t know what happened to him. I know that he was a long time in kalna — in — in Kretinga. I know that he would fight with Polish prisoners. There were some young Polish deported from Warsaw and put in some barracks in Kretinga. And the Germans let them go, you know, in the city. They were all intelligent, all students. Lithuanian 141April 30, 2012 girls were very happy, all the gymnasts’, were really fine guys. And they used to fight with these hooligans, Lithuanians, with the stones.

   A: Yes, I go to Kaunas. I go to Kaunas twice. One time I go a little bit earlier, with that, with — with — with some friends who already studied in Kaunas, you know, some were older, studied in Kaunas. And the last time I was in Kaunas, when Vilnius was occupied second time by the Soviet Union, when we had to run just out of Kaunas.
  </p>
  <p id="1559">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1560">

   Q: Okay. So, I’m trying to get a sense of how much one would know at that time. Not much, it sounds like.
  </p>
  <p id="1574">
   A: What my — my understanding is that there were not many left. There were not many left — left, who hid themselves and somehow survived, because that started the partisan times. There were Soviet partisans and there were Lithuanian partisans. 143 April 30, 2012 Lithuanian partisans fought the Soviet partisans and German partisans. And so — and they were tel — told that, you know — so that was the — the tragic time again for Lithuanians, for young people.

   Q: Yellow fever?

  <p id="1604">
   A: — y-yellow fever. All the — probably she had the cancer. The whole body went yellow. And the — there were no medicine. We tried to get the German doctor, German doctor didn’t come, there were no doctors. And whatever she took. But she was already — one year before she always complained that she has something, something, something. And she probably sensed that she — you know how Lithuanian mother is that said, little kinder — little children, I probably will be leaving you. I probably will be leaving you. And one day suddenly, she was yellow — yellow, she worked and everything and suddenly died, and then when she died, my father was little bit on edge. He didn’t know how to cook, he didn’t know how to do anything, laundry or anything. My elder sister was a dame. She never peeled a potato, she never did anything. Mother spoiled her. I was the one who knew little how to cook, because my — my mother was my friend. Our father was the girls’ friends. So that I took over and Father was very angry many times. I — I had the —
  </p>
  <p id="1605">
   Q: You didn’t cook as well, did you?
  </p>
  <p id="1606">
   A: I— yeah, and I —I felt that I — I have to disappear. And that was for me a good — good reason. I said, I am going to — to mine tante, or aunt, and I will stay there. And then after that when they — I mean, when they run someplace, Il run with them. And they ran too, we ran with them. And we separated and — and I don’t 146April 30, 2012 know. The bombardments in Germany was — and you have to hide. I had a da — advantage. Guess what?
  </p>
  <p id="1607">
   Q: What’s that?
  </p>
  <p id="1608">
   A: Small.
  </p>
  <p id="1609">
   Q: You were a little guy?
  </p>
  <p id="1610">
   A: S— yeah. Small, young looking. I looked like — I was 17, I looked like 15, like 14. And I hid myself like this. They didn’t take. Now I could — I — now I tell you, but I — I Just speculated, you know?
  </p>
  <p id="1611">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1612">
   A: I used to go with a— on a bus from Kretinga to Palanga. And you know, for kids was free. But I was playing yi — small, and I didn’t need to — to — to pay for that. And I used to go free for [indecipherable]. So that, hey, combination, you know, speculation, all kind of things.
  </p>
  <p id="1613">
   Q: I want to ask something, going back to the main topic of our — of our discussion. And that is, did what you see with that torture and I’d say defilement and cruelty to those Jewish men, did that change you? Did you feel like you — somehow or other it changed some part of you?
  </p>
  <p id="1614">
   A: It changed.
  </p>
  <p id="1615">
   Q: In what way”? 147April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1616">
   A: It changed when I grew up. When I grew up, it changed. It changed that the — to subject one what I don’t want, to pain some other one. If you break, if you do, if you beat. And, you know, when I was young, I was little bit, you know, edgy and so, you know, [indecipherable] and — and hitting something. After that, I had never had a fight in my life.
  </p>
  <p id="1617">
   Q: So after you saw such things.
  </p>
  <p id="1618">
   A: Ne -— te — but I—I kind of —I kind of grew up very early. But I was in a-—ina Germany, or — or something, or — or some disagreement with some friend or something, I never wanted to get in a fight. Not that I was afraid that I will not win. You know, you just protect yourself. But no, but just — just a— now, when I see grown people fighting, or the lithu — you know, Lithuanian fights, especially [indecipherable] you know, when — when they — they get drunk and they fight. And I never smoked in my life and I don’t drink. I drink socially, but I— my father was drinking and I swore to myself, I will not subject my family what he subjected us. And there 1s a story, laughing story to tell.
  </p>
  <p id="1619">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1620">
   A: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1621">
   Q: But — but so, what you saw did change you.
  </p>
  <p id="1622">
   A: Change, change. 148 April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1623">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1624">
   A: And when I see now — when I — you know, I watch the movies and everything, and I see those tortures. And especially now recently was history channel about the — the — the Third Reich and the fall. And they showed pictures, and after that they showed the Germans, how they have to go to Dachau and take care of the bodies, and you see — and I think it was good. Now, the Germans claim — probably this is not, but the Germans claim that we didn’t know. Yeah, you didn’t know, but feel the guilt. Feel. Because yeah, this was your people You elect na — not elected, but you supported Adolf. You supported Adolf. He was good, so long at wi — everything was okay. When 1s bad, then is bad. But not all Germans too.
  </p>
  <p id="1625">
   Q: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1626">
   A: Germans fought quite a bit against that.
  </p>
  <p id="1627">
   Q: There were some.
  </p>
  <p id="1628">
   A: But about Germans in — in Klaipeda, I have nothing good.
  </p>
  <p id="1629">
   Q: The other thing I wanted to ask you about is that it took a long time, if we talk about 2010, when you wrote this article and you had it published — maybe you passed it in 2008, but it sat in you for a long time, until you were ready to speak.
  </p>
  <p id="1630">
   A: It’s — it sat, yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1631">
   Q: Why did it take so long, do you think? 149April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1632">
   A: I think I mentioned a little bit that I was not sure if I should reveal this. I was — I knew that one day, after me, or before me or whatever, I have to tell. But there was my personal neglect. I always set priorities. You know, to sit such a article, you have to sit, you have to concentrate, you have to have time. I was working. I was — I had this tough — tough job. I had the — I was in charge of several office of Citibank international banking, Cleveland, Ohio, Minneapolis, Saint Louis and Chicago, the hub for Citibank international business. So — and I had the people, it — so — and I had many, many Jewish friends in Citibank. Jewish hired me, and my bosses were, my co-workers were. So that — that I— I—I couldn’t tell anyone. I couldn’t tell anyone.
  </p>
  <p id="1633">
   Q: So you didn’t share this with anyone?
  </p>
  <p id="1634">
   A: No, no, this — this I didn’t share.
  </p>
  <p id="1635">
   Q: Did you share it with your wife, or your kids?
  </p>
  <p id="1636">
   A: My wife?
  </p>
  <p id="1637">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1638">
   A: I shared with my wife, no not — not the kids. The kids didn’t want to — to — to listen. They didn’t want to. They don’t want to. And the kids — Lithuanians were poor — poor Lithuanian, I wrote to Lithuania — like the book now, which I 150April 30, 2012 published, sorry. I published in Lithuanian, they cannot a — they — they cannot enjoy the reading. They can understand, but they cannot enjoy the reading.
  </p>
  <p id="1639">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1640">
   A: And I’m sorry that I was lazy, I could not, at least part translate too.
  </p>
  <p id="1641">
   Q: Now, I want to ask you. You mentioned in your book that you wrote about everything, but you didn’t write about this part in your book, about what happened to the Jews.
  </p>
  <p id="1642">
   A: No, I didn’t write, I didn’t.
  </p>
  <p id="1643">
   Q: And why would that be? Why would you leave it out?
  </p>
  <p id="1644">
   A: Well, because that — but that time, what I wrote in that book, I wrote my high school, how I left Lithuania and how I started high school in Germany.
  </p>
  <p id="1645">
   Q: Oh, so you li — you don’t talk about before?
  </p>
  <p id="1646">
   A: No.
  </p>
  <p id="1647">
   Q: Okay.
  </p>
  <p id="1648">
   A: No. The — in Germany. What we did in Germany, that you — you will see that it — that’s what we — how we prayed, how we learn, what we learned, how was that. You will see that in the book is just that part, and then university, Baltic University and the end.
  </p>
  <p id="1649">
   Q: Okay. 151April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1650">
   A: And nothing else, no America.
  </p>
  <p id="1651">
   Q: I see, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1652">
   A: No America.
  </p>
  <p id="1653">
   Q: I see, I see.
  </p>
  <p id="1654">
   A: They wanted that I — I write again and now they are asking me, and I must admit, I — I am newly married, and I — I don’t have time. I don’t have the patience, I don’t have time. And that book was published when my first wife was already with Alzheimer’s.
  </p>
  <p id="1655">
   Q: Oh dear.
  </p>
  <p id="1656">
   A: And I was in such a hurry, I ask my friends, group, we had the group, that we all contribute. If we publish the book, each one part. And I waited three or four years; nobody responded like to this article. Nobody wants to talk.
  </p>
  <p id="1657">
   Q: Why? Why do you think that’s the case?
  </p>
  <p id="1658">
   A: Yeah. Nobody — nobody calls me, nobody there. There probably are some Lithuanians someplace, but no.
  </p>
  <p id="1659">
   Q: Nobody was interested in what you had revealed there?
  </p>
  <p id="1660">
   A: No, no. And when I ask, di — have you read? No. I say, was in two pages, in Saturday publication.
  </p>
  <p id="1661">
   Q: The most read publication of that newspaper. 152 April 30, 2012
  </p>
  <p id="1662">
   A: Yeah. One lady wrote me, say oh, I read your article — email — I read your article. My mother told me something that happened someplace else, and I would like to — what my mother told, I would like to write, or whatever. And that’s it, yeah. And that’s little bit, kind of angered me that was not enough response for th — [break] — and I hope, therefore that this will be the contribution to your museum, and to the relationship between the Jews, the folks, and the Lithuanian folks.
  </p>
  <p id="1663">
   Q: Thank you. Thank you very much. If there’s anything else you’d like to add, that I haven’t talked to you about —
  </p>
  <p id="1664">
   A: Nothing. I — I wanted, because there is no lie, nothing is a lie. So if — if there is some doubt, there is not intentionally, but probably. Because I went to Lithuania special, on a trip. I went there, I measured, I looked. I walked around the pond, and this one, that I don’t make mistake. And in that article is much more than I told you today. An explicit.
  </p>
  <p id="1665">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="1666">
   A: What was on one side, what was on other side, how that was. Is — 1s much better expressed that I expressed in my report now.
  </p>
  <p id="1667">
   Q: But tell me, did people in Kretinga read this article?
  </p>
  <p id="1668">
   A: I gave to my relatives, the day we delivered to Kretinga newspapers. I don’t know. You know that they hesitate? They don’t want to know that such things 153 April 30, 2012 happened. Because there is always some needle come out from someplace. There are some people who probably feel, and to publish this one, there would be sensation. And when I went to Lithuania, when I presented in Kretinga, in a church meeting, I presented my book, because I am from Kretinga, there were about hundred people. I give presentation. I didn’t had the article yet. I didn’t had the article. And you know, my book was presented in Mazvydas library, and was said to be [indecipherable] ga — was that — in charge. He said, one of the best books about DPs, which doesn’t talk much individually about the person, but about general, about everyone. So.
