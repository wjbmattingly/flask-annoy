   A: Ina way, he wasn’t super democrat, but he was very good to the Jews. And he needed the Jews badly.

  <p id="47">
   Q: Okay.

   A: We- suddenly, when the war started, many Jewish people fled from Poland and came and each and every family brought in somebody to live because they there were quite a few but this 1s a habit of Jewish people someone comes over and would sleep over a night and then stay and if they don’t have money they don’t pay. And now we are the ‘40s. And we, we, we, we didn’t move. We should have moved. But where can we move? You cannot enter Palestine because the English don’t let us.

   A: Yes. So and my father which minimized after had a business the little that he had, all that it — he couldn’t-it has to be nationalized everything had to be nationalized. But the biggest shock was they took away our Hebrew. And we were, I would say Israelis, we were Hebrew kids and Hebrew was everything. Even the Lithuanian language was https://collections.ushmm.org  na started in Hebrew. And this is forbidden. Yiddish. But I cannot write Yiddish. There is a difference in Yiddish if it is uh 1f you write the same letters in Hebrew and Yiddish you write the same letters in Hebrew, but the — for example “A” “E” just to give you an example.

  <p id="71">
   A: We knew it, we knew it, we — nobody touched us. Nobody did anything bad to us. Maybe here and there (another language spoken). But it didn’t come to an extent of hitting but maybe some other, boys and girls. But mainly not. It was not no. It was not — I cannot tell and when the Russians came, everybody’s equal. And the Jews have the same rights like everybody else but they had the same rights before too, they had even better rights. It was a shock but we stayed in the same flat. The biggest shock was that we couldn’t practice Hebrew anymore. So we did it — Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection -

   Q: So you went to the —
  </p>
  <p id="183">
   A: Only the men. The infants were with the mothers.
  </p>
  <p id="184">
   Q: So the men were in the synagogue that went up in flames? I see, okay. It was put on fire, in other words.
  </p>
  <p id="185">
   A: And then the ceremony started. Take the Torah books, go with them, and they shouted “hey,” they were watching us. Put in on fire.
  </p>
  <p id="186">
   Q: So this was the militia?
  </p>
  <p id="187">
   A: Why? What happening to our neighbors, to such an extent? I didn’t know that was happening in Kaunas was much worse. They went from house to house. So, I don’t know. Where are my parents? Where is my sister? Where is my little brother? Where is Vincent (ph), where is Teraza (ph)? I will tell you something. Vincent (ph) and Teraza (ph) were considered family. This is the same unit. It’s not something upstairs- downstairs. We are sitting there in this synagogue about three weeks.
  </p>
  <p id="188">
   Q: About how many people were in it?
  </p>
  <p id="189">
   A: Tons. One hundred fifty. Terrible. We had no restrooms and we had hardly something to eat. And every day it was a procession of the books. All the book in the synagogue. We had to carry them and put them on fire. There was beating, there was cursing.
  </p>
  <p id="190">
   Q: And was it Germans or was it Lithuanians or was it both?
  </p>
  <p id="191">
   A: The Germans were not there.
  </p>
  <p id="192">
   Q: Lithuanians. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 3
  </p>
  <p id="193">
   A: They were busy. Blitz. We would go and one-and-a-half days Lithuania was — and the soldiers would run away. I compare it sometimes with, of course, with the Arabs. When they flee, they leave the shoes. They flee. They’re afraid of us.
  </p>
  <p id="194">
   Q: So they were —
  </p>
  <p id="195">
   A: They were afraid of us. Today, I don’t know. But don’t worry, we will settle it. We know what to do. You know, what is the worst thing 1s the helpless, you are helpless. There 1s nothing you can do. Suddenly there is nothing you can do. You can’t flee you don’t know where to flee. You don’t know what happened to your parents. And to make a long story short, a Lithuanian, a non-Jew, had good relationship with The Red Cross. And he had a Jewish friend, and they sent three buses and we were shipped to another place and never mind it’s a complicated—and the buses brought us to Kaunas. And Vincent, (ph) my brother, came to fetch me from there was a Jewish center in Kaunas where the orphanage was if you know, where it is, and the old people knows and you can see it engraved there was The Ten Commandments. And then I have a very good feeling. Because, if they were waiting for me maybe they would run away together with the Russians. And many ran away. It was terrible.
  </p>
  <p id="196">
   Q: What did you see when you get back to Kaunas? What did you —?
  </p>
  <p id="197">
   A: Empty streets. People didn’t dare to go out. There were 14 thousand Jews and ten thousand killed by Lithuanians in the first month. Killed. And the question is, why? And sometimes I think that the factor of to rob us and to look for gold and diamonds and things like this. Was also — or, 1t was somewhere, maybe, the organizist (ph) is maybe because we Christ, we put Jesus on the cross. But no we didn’t put — the Romans put — Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection 7 it’s crazy. It’s absolutely —

  <p id="198">
   Q: What was your mother like? When you came home she must have been frightened too because you were in Palanga and she didn’t know what was happening.
  </p>
  <p id="199">
   A: Ofcourse. My health, my father, my mother, didn’t turn out that Tereza (ph) told me. They went from flat to flat. And their headquarters just in front of the watershed.
  </p>
  <p id="200">
   Q: And you lived on that square?
  </p>
  <p id="201">
   A: Yes. And they used to come very often. To look for the Jews. And she said they took them away. She was hiding them under the bed, and in the cupboards. All kinds of hiding places 1n the flat. So they had to look. She said “Me, I, they didn’t give it to me. It’s me I took it. My little girl. And we are very happy they took them. Put on a plate.” I didn’t know — I wouldn’t know it I would put name by the righteous, because she risked her life. I don’t know if she is still alive but she she did not everybody did. Some just turn in and she — we came to Pulsa Pukamas (ph), I’m shifting. And Tereza (ph) took off the rings and said this is the ring my mother, your mother gave to my mother.
  </p>
  <p id="202">
   Q: Aww. Oh dear.
  </p>
  <p id="203">
   A: I want you to have it. It’s a big ring it was a big ring. It was a white ring. She cut it in three pieces and gave it to Teraza to me and her. And she said, “take all the furniture.” Four years ago we had the furniture nice furniture. “Take everything,” she said. “We won’t come back.” And no, I didn’t take it. What I took 1s a picture of me playing the violin. I hated the violin. And we had lunch on our tablecloths.

  </p>
  <p id="214">
   Q: Tell me about that. How did that occur? What do you remember about going into the ghetto?
  </p>
  <p id="215">
   A: When he came, with the carriage and the horse. And they put us in the ghetto. And what the Germans did they said, “Now we are going to form a ghetto. And this is after the war will be over then you will go back to your houses.” _I mean, they did everything to avoid a revolution. How do you avoid revolutions? Drops of hope. Okay we’ll come back. And so immediately there was an organized lot to make sure you are managing the ghetto. And the police. And (other language spoken) which means, those who — we’ ll give you four or five people we’ll give you one room. They gave us one room. The room was a kitchen we had to share with another two or three families. If not the very convenient the grown-up girl too, but it wasn’t the worst. This wasn’t the worst. This was a Garden of Eden compared to the concentration camps. Contact reference@ushmm.org for further information about tis collection ng

  </p>
  <p id="222">
   Q: Okay. Democracy Square. (other language spoken)
  </p>
  <p id="223">
   A: Sometimes you really know names. And — the all of us did not know what to do. Because they understood that something wrong was going to be here. They said, “What do we do?” So a secular Jew, who doesn’t believe in God, goes to the rabbi. Go to the rabbi and ask the rabbi what to do. Rabbi Shapiro. “Rabbi, what shall we do?” And they say, “I need to look in the holy books. I can’t tell you — come later, come to our later.” I said yes you have to report. And they said Elkes which was the head of the ghetto, said, “uh, why, Rabbi Shapiro, do we have to report? Let them take me wherever they want.” “No, but if we are organized maybe a few people will stay alive. And they will tell. What they did to us.” So, here I am to tell you what they did to us. It 1s eh,5 o’clock in the morning, 6 o’clock in the morning and there were two murderers Rauca and Jordan (ph).

   A: I think there were forts (ph), there were Nazis. And they should stay feminist, and they will stay home, we will kill them on the spot, which they did. And then they stick to the left is the good side and the right 1s the bad side. And I look at my family and I say they need walking partner. They can’t still walk. All right with all of us. Even for me, I said. But what would they do with the little one? He 1s now spoiling the whole thing. Because of him he’|l go to the bad side. But the police was the good side. Where the establishment was, there was a good side and there was a bad side. All the other, mainly women and children. And I said “Aye aye aye.” But when we same to Rauca (ph). I put like this. Very tall family. My father was very tall. My mother was also tall woman. My sister was tall. And even I was tall. To my age. At that time I —

  </p>
  <p id="233">
   A: We were, I wouldn’t say happy but we were content in the good side and it was heartbreaking. Because they took all of them there and cried and they stood there in the little ghetto. They all were part of the ghetto. If you saw it. In the ghetto was a bridge. We probably say it many times and they put them in the ghetto and from there, there was already one action before. Dr. Elkas (ph) went back then please save this he wanted to save and he was beaten. And then they, the very same day or the next day we say them going up the hill to Fort Number Nine. You know where it is?
  </p>
  <p id="234">

   A: Or maybe some none Jewish people as well. Fort was one the nine forts or ten forts that surrounded Kaunas during the Russians built a — a kind of fort to protect and defend Kaunas. And even today when you go and see, have you been? Have you seen the little guns there?
  </p>
  <p id="238">
   Q: I don’t recall that. I’ve been there but I don’t recall that?
  </p>
  <p id="239">
   A: We have to go very, very down. The trenches were already ready. We saw them going uphill. And they were shot on the very same day. And later on burned. This was the big action because they needed the great action. The problem 1s there are less and less people coming because the people are dying out.
  </p>
  <p id="240">
   Q: Yeah.
  </p>

  <p id="242">
   Q: You could hear the shooting?
  </p>
  <p id="243">
   A: Yes, there was a lot of shooting. It was again, women and children. There was very little to do. What could they do? Nothing. Maybe some of them they put in the cells. In Fort Number Nine. But when they killed, the German Jews and the French Jews, they, put them in the cells first and then they killed them. There’s a story from one girl. She lives here in New York somewhere. She says Jordan (ph) came, and rescued their family because her mother was a seamstress. What happened then 1s fairly quiet years. It doesn’t mean there were quiet years because people got shipped to Estonia. And for work and _ then they were killed. And they were shipped to all kinds of to — Shancy (ph).

  </p>
  <p id="246">
   Q: By establishment, what do you mean?
  </p>
  <p id="247">
   A: Establishment is the police, the work office, and Unrat (ph). This 1s what we call establishment. Maybe there is another word in English for it.
