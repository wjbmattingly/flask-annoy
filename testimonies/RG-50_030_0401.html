   Question: I'll just begin and have you both say your full names again. Rachel: Okay. Sulamif: My full name? In -- in -- I don’t know what I told you, in several |-languages it’s different.
  </p>
  <p id="1">
   Q: The name that you go by now. S: By now I am still having the Russian way, Sulamit, because I came here with papers, Russian papers, so it was written Sulamit. R: So just tell Sulamit. S: Sulamif. I am sorry, Sulamif. Not t, but f on this -- on the ba -- Sulamif. R: Like is in your documents [indecipherable] S: Like in my passport, like that, S-u-l-a-m-1-f.
  </p>
  <p id="2">
   Q: And your last name? S: Zhabinskaya. A big, long one. I would like to change it to Zhabinski like my husband’s name, because we have different names, you know, the Slavic -- Slavic countries, in Poland and in Russia, in nu -- in Lithuania, the ending -- endings of the family names are different for men and for women. If you ra -- marry a man who is Zhabinski, you will be -- or Zhabinskaya, it’s in Russian way, or Zhabinska, it’s in Polish way, or Zhabinskaynia, in Lithuanian way. But we want choose something.
  </p>
  <p id="3">
   Q: Rachel? R: Rachel Gurdus. Simple.
  </p>
  <p id="4">
   Q: Over the last two days, you both spoke about your experiences during the Holocaust, and you both referred to each other quite a bit, because you spent much of that time together. So I want to go back to when you first began spending time together. I -- I suppose it was in the ghetto. S: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="5">
   Q: Y-You were sort of pushed together by your families. If you could just say a little bit about -- about how you understood that. D-Did your parents say you must always be together, or was it because you were both girls, or -- S: No, it was my -- my f -- my parents didn’t say anything to me. They -- as Rachel told you, my father was -- told the family that if my brother loves Rachel, so Pll love her too. And she has to be in our family. So that’s it, no more conversations, we’re done. It was like a point of [indecipherable] yeah, that’s it. And then we were pushed together to sleep together. So sh -- I found her like a -- like a -- know, she protects me. Like I was a child and she was already a young lady, like she was 20, I was 15. It was a difference then. And she was protecting me in many cases. So I liked it. Now --
  </p>
  <p id="6">
   Q: Rachel, the -- mm-hm? S: Mm-hm? R: And lately we were protecting each other, I would think. And we were happy that we were together, because first of all it was easier to go through, and secondly we were very attached to each other, and very li -- loved each other. She was small, I was caring, afraid for her life, only not to be separated from me. And as you see, we went through the whole war together.
  </p>
  <p id="7">
   Q: Things were so confusing in those times that you ended up living with your boyfriend’s family. I mean, that wouldn’t have happened if there hadn’t been a war. What was that like for you to be all of a sudden thrust into his family, you weren't married yet -- R: In the beginning was very scary, because I still, in spite of my age, I was childish. And then we were very busy, afraid what would happen, what would be happening tomorrow, what happened yesterday. And I remember sitting in the window watching how he’s coming from where, being afraid because I knew that he has some weapons under his coat. Was he caught or not? S: What are -- what are you talking about, the ghetto? R: Yes. S: Or the -- after? And you asked her about the get --
  </p>
  <p id="8">
   Q: I asked about the ghetto. R: Yes. S: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. R: And you know, she was studying ghetto, as -- she’s told you that she belongs to a club. I also belong to the club, but I was busy working outside the ghetto. And it was a pleasure to meet in the evening again and talking about [indecipherable] or talking about the situation in ghetto and what will happen and what should we do, should we fight in the ghetto, should we go out? And Luta, today is she there, and there will be an action, and she runs away to the city, to Veronica. And the parents was scary over our life. S: Was scared.
  </p>
  <p id="9">
   Q: Did you and Josef plan to get married? Did you talk about that? R: Of course we did. We were waiting until the war will be ended and we were thinking how it would work out, how it will be, how it -- how nice it will be. And even the people who lived with us in the same room, like engineer Konitsky and his daughter, she said, oy Rachel, I want to live long enough to see you when you’ll be fa -- boss of your -- when you'll be free. Yeah, you know. S: My family was good to her. My mother told me, she is my daughter, not you. Cause I never listened to my mother. R: [indecipherable] S: But it’s true. R: Her mother la -- [indecipherable] S: My family loved her, she -- she was really very devoted to our family, very lovely, very good. And I think she felt that we love her too. The parents -- R: And her father was a teacher of my older sister Luba. In school, in gymnasium, and in technical. Do you know that Luba was the last [indecipherable] S: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. She was one girl, you know, among -- among the boys in technical school.
  </p>
  <p id="10">
   Q: Your family really adopted Rachel. S: Yeah, yeah. And I think -- I think she felt like -- like a daughter in our family, not like a adopted child, but a daughter.
  </p>
  <p id="11">
   Q: So, were you conscious of -- of -- of your parents -- well, I guess your father -- S: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="12">
   Q: -- gave you this order, really, don’t run away from Rachel. And was that something that you kept in your mind? S: Yeah, of course, yes. Yes, ha -- R: We were very much devoted, through all the years, and you -- S: My father was for me like I -- I don’t know, in some [indecipherable] feel like such a devotion, such a -- he was -- I know that people were talking about him very highly, that he was a very honest and very noble person, and I felt also like that. Then, after years, I thought -- I felt a little bit different. I -- I am accusing him -- I cannot say accusing him, it’s too strong, but I think that he destroyed the family. He didn’t allow my mother to emigrate, and he didn’t allow my mother to -- to run from the Germans the first day. So that was it. R: No, don’t say it. S: Yeah, it’s true. You have to look -- the truth has eyes. That’s it. It’s too much responsibility, he took over a big responsibility to say no, I don’t want it. Well, what do you mean you don’t want it? You are responsible for your wife and children. That’s it. R: In the ghetto she used to teach me physics and chemistry. S: He teach you. R: He. S: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="13">
   Q: I want to take you forward to the time in the cemetery where it’s the liquidation of the ghetto. At this point your father and your brother have already been taken away. S: Yeah. R: And my father and my brother-in-law.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: Also. Okay. And you briefly find your mothers, but then you’re separated again. A-At that moment, when you go to the right, are you physically next to each other? S: To each other?
  </p>
  <p id="15">
   Q: Are you standing next to each other? R: Yes. S: Of course. When we went through the gate -- I don’t remember, you went the first? Because I remember my mom, my mom was behind me. So probably you were the first -- R: I don’t remember. S: -- like I said, I was the second [indecipherable]
  </p>
  <p id="16">
   Q: I mean, did you -- it seems like such a chaotic scene, did you -- did you hold onto each other, or you were just able to stay physically close, so that you would get in the same wagon? S: Yeah, we were -- of course we were watching not to be separated, of course, yes. R: We were scared. We were not -- we didn’t know where we are going, what will happen. We saw the tragedy of a lot of people, that children were left over, and -- S: I didn’t touch this point. I didn’t touch because a loss 0 -- a lot of young mothers left their chil- small children behind, not to go to the left with them. Okay, I didn't touch it, it’s too -- it’s difficult to take. One thing is if a grown-up, it’s not a grown-up, but it’s not a small child that is leaving the parents, another thing is when the parents are leaving, the mother is leaving th -- her children. Cause that’s life. That what people did. Not all. Her sister [indecipherable] went together with her son. Her other sister went together with her mother. R: They’re willing to live -- S: It’s so strong. R: It’s very strong. S: Mm-hm. R: Very, very strong. If your mind is still open.
  </p>
  <p id="17">
   Q: Did you both always have that, or -- or were there times that when one was maybe losing the will to live? S: I don’t think so. R: No. S: No. R: I never lose the will -- S: Lost. I don’t think so.
  </p>
  <p id="18">
   Q: How do you think having each other kept you going? R: All the time I thought about is that it’s -- we survive because we have each other. There were situations when, you know, you were not so strong any more, to go on. S: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   Q: Certainly at the -- the end, when Luta was so sick, you just kept pushing. She -- she described you in the f-farmhouse after liberation. S: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: That you were very energetic, you were throwing clothes away, and washing and -- S: Cooking.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   Q: -- I couldn’t help but think, where did you get that energy? S: The energy was from the happiness to be free, because she was not deadly sick, thank God. I was deadly sick. But I couldn’t -- R: This was a terrible time when all the people was already free --
  </p>
  <p id="22">
   Q: So was there ever anything that -- in any moment that Rachel said to you or did, that really became something that you held on to? S: I couldn’t understand that?
  </p>
  <p id="23">
   Q: Was there ever anything that she said to you -- S: Mm-hm.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: -- do this, don’t do this, always remember this. Was there anything that she said to you that you sort of kept?
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   Q: Luta, you were very strong willed. S: I don’t know. R: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="26">
   Q: That’s how you described yourself, or -- or it seems that you had a strong will, to me, when I hear some of the stories that you tell. What made you listen to Rachel? Because sometimes you did. S: I did all the time. Now I am not listening to her. I did. No, look, she was older as I am, and she was -- I know that she was very friendly to me, she -- and -- R: The war did that. S: The war did, yeah, and then what -- what -- what she told me was right. We didn’t discuss such things like political things or something very big and very clever, but day to day things, thought she knew better than I. What can I -- what can a 15 - 16 - 17 years old teenager know about life? She used to grab me -- R: But you were -- you were [indecipherable] S: -- to her, and to cover my eyes not to see how -- how women were raped. She covered my eyes, she didn’t let me see a lot of things.
  </p>
  <p id="27">
   Q: But who covered your eyes? R: Nobody. No [indecipherable] cover your eyes.
  </p>
  <p id="28">
   Q: A-And you have kept this connection --
  </p>
  <p id="29">
   Q: -- all these years. S: Yeah. R: Yes.
  </p>
  <p id="30">
   Q: Can you just talk a little bit about that? S: [indecipherable] R: No. It’s hard to explain how it come, but I -- but I felt a friend in her, in spite of the -- th-the -- that I was very devoted to the whole family, I felt a friend, and I like her, and I can’t tell you why. Even now I can’t know why I like her, but I like her. S: No, it’s a -- she’ll -- related like sisters, that is the proper -- R: But you felt like sister. S: Like a -- like a family. R: And -- and I am -- I like very much her children, they were devoted. S: And they like her. R: Yeah. S: Yeah, and they -- R: And my children like her. Even my grandchildren. I told you my granddaughter said that we have to make a gathering -- S: A family gathering. R: -- from the family, and Luta with her children will come. S: Ha -- have to come. They have to come. R: [indecipherable] I said yes, the whole family. S: Yeah.
  </p>
  <p id="31">
   Q: Is there anything else either of you want to add? R: I don’t think so.
  </p>
  <p id="32">
   Q: I did ju -- R: I -- I want her to be healthy and good, and be -- I want her to be all her life. S: Lam.
  </p>
  <p id="33">
   Q: I did want to ask, because this has been a bit of a theme. Both of you mentioned that you hadn’t talked in a lot of detail to your children. A-And I think you Luta said that -- that you hadn't really shared the story with hardly anybody. What made you decide to -- to do it now? What were your thoughts about it? S: I think that Rachel told me about it, and she told me, can we come together? And I thought that -- that no, we are not young already and it comes a time when maybe we have to do it, like obligation, not like a -- a goodwill, but obligation. Maybe to leave it for my children, if not for the history, is for my children, because my son is pushing me all the time, but he is not pushing me all the time to -- to write about the Holocaust time, but about the family, what -- he doesn’t know the family of course, because they -- he didn’t know his grandparents and so I thought, maybe it’s time, and because she is going, so I’Il go with her. R: So we went together.

   Q: Thank you very much. R: You’re welcome.

  <p id="35">
   Q: What was his name? S: Mora.
  </p>
  <p id="36">
   Q: His first name? S: I don’t know, fr -- Hans, or fr -- I don’t know, I don’t remember. R: [indecipherable] S: He was such a horrible man. If you -- he find you on his way, he will shit -- R: Shot. S: -- he will shot you -- he will shoot you without regret. Anything. R: It was the horror of the ghetto if he would standing -- S: And the Poles wanted him [indecipherable] and the Poles -- the Polish people had the death penalty. They would hung him, one, two, three. That what they did to every such a murderer they found. R: You know, and he growed up three sons, very educated, very strong, and this came an old Jew who even can’t talk right, you know -- S: Yeah. [indecipherable] R: -- and he is a witness. S: They were whispering, they were laughing, and it was horrible. R: But that’s what it is. S: That’s it. R: They destroyed the best. S: Yeah, the best they destroyed. The culture, the Jewish culture of east Europe didn’t -- didn’t come back. They destroyed. Of course some people, as we survived, and we produced other people, yeah. But the culture, gone. Everything is gone.
