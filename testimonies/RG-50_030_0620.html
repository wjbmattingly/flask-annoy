They were preparing us to go to Africa and we got sent to Germany. After that we because we were built at Indio, California, the desert training center, there was nothing there when we got there. After that we went to New York and we departed for Europe and we landed in Marlborough. We were on the Queen Mary. We had 23,000 people on that ship. We slept in shifts, more or less. And it took us a long time, because they were saying that, be careful, you know, after the big boat, you know, Queen Mary

They had the invasion and I think we went about three weeks, or two weeks after the invasion, because they had to make room for us to land because of the fighting there and stuff. When I got there, you could still see ships, their nose up, I mean. We had to stay on the landing barges for a day or two before we went to shore, you know.

Because at that time we had soldiers and dogs weren't allowed in the taverns and (inaudible) they didn't allow us there, so, but, like I say, I was one of the first draftees to go. Ijust JIalmost had I didn't care about it, because I had eight months in and who wanted, you know, the army? If all of them wants to go and then the war broke out and I had to get go and, you know, and then we didn't now how long the war was going to last, whether it was going to last a year, two years, five years, ten years or a hundred year war or whatever it is. But, that's the way it was.
  </p>
  <p id="14">
   Q: What did you train as, sir? What were you an infantryman? an armorman?
  </p>
  <p id="15">

   Q: Did you select it or were you assigned?
  </p>
  <p id="19">
   A: No, I was assigned as a medic, because they were asking people to drive for (inaudible) and stuff like that. But, I took the medics, because I thought it was safer than being in the gutter or somewhere in there.
  </p>
  <p id="20">
   Q: Uh huh.
  </p>
  <p id="21">
   A: So, that's what it was.
  </p>
  <p id="22">

  </p>
  <p id="23">
   A: Oh, yeah. We had to have combat training and then — especially in the desert with the tanks, maneuvers and stuff. We had good training over there in the desert. The heat was 125 out there. We actually, sometimes didn't do anything, but to get used to the weather, you know. But, I had a suntan. I wore shorts all the time and you could see the white here and all black here.
  </p>
  <p id="24">
   Q: What did you understand of the war and why it was being fought, before going to Europe?
  </p>
  <p id="25">
   A: Well, I didn't think too much of it. I mean it's war. War is a war. I mean you have to nobody likes war. I mean as far as that goes, war is hell. But we you're in there, you got to do the best you can, because there was a lot of fellows that didn't like it and committed suicide and all that but, thank G d, I held out and I come back in one piece. That's the main thing.

  </p>
  <p id="31">
   A: Training, yeah. We were waiting for the invasion, you know, because they would send out ships (inaudible) and they were testing out the Germans there, you know, because they had all the coastline all pretty well fortified and we landed in England, they had we had gas masks, because England was all set for if they would get poisoned gas and stuff and in case the Russians the Germans, but they were fighting two fronts, in the back and in the front and Russians, and us, you know, so they had double trouble there, and once we could go __ got along pretty good.
  </p>
  <p id="32">

  </p>
  <p id="33">
   A: Well, I didn't think too much of them, you know, we made friends and stuff.

But they got it later on when they after invasion. They found out that the (inaudible) people right in front of you, you know what I mean, but cause we were (inaudible) division. We had to take care of all divisions. Some go and some come. You have to be well prepared for that.

But cause some generals they Patton wanted a credit, Eisenhower wanted a credit, MacArthur wanted a credit, Bradley wanted a credit, and Churchill wanted I mean, they all wanted to outdo one another, but, I guess they got along, so

Cause we had our own little G1, G2, G3, G4, we had to care of officers and enlisted men, to give them shots and whatever they needed. But, we didn't go right up to the front because we had _ Patton had his men up there. All he wanted was tanks, tanks, tanks, the hell with the infantry.

So, we had_ Iwas like they asked me first if I wanted an army occupation and I didn't want that, I wanted to get home, the heck with that. So, they left me there anyway. And there 1s no revelling, no retreat, no nothing. But we went horseback riding and then we could play golf, and nobody to, you know, bother you or stuff.

And we seen how the soldiers they hada flagpole they tried to get out, because they knew we were coming and the Germans shot them and left. They were right by the flagpole there and stuff. But so and then the only way we could see them is they wouldn't allow us to feed them or anything like that, they were fed intravenously, the ones that were ready to die anyway, I mean, but we got in cause we had medical I had a van and, you know, I was with the captain, so, he was a medical officer. So, they let us in and we went in the camp there, and it stunk and the tears and the urine and all that stuff. I couldn't stand it.

They hated the Frenchmen hated SS they were supposed to be the elite of the army there. So, they take them and march them in the forests and you could hear boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, they got aim with them.
  </p>
  <p id="80">

  </p>
  <p id="87">
   A: Well, seeing these bodies right there, packed like 2 by 4s, you could see they're all skin and bones. And inthe back the crematoria, there was all ashes that they emptied out. Because they had two like two small freight cars and they put them in and they take them out. I didn't see that seen them doing it, but I seen the ovens there, you know. I tried to take a picture, but it didn't come out. It blurred and stuff, all black. But you could still make out a little bit that it was the freight cars, them little freighters.
  </p>
  <p id="88">
   Q: After seeing Buchenwald, after seeing the concentration camp, did it change your attitudes about the war and why you were fighting it?
  </p>
  <p id="89">
   A: Yeah. Then I realized that we had to do it, I mean, after all, otherwise it will kill everybody. Especially the Polish people, because there's a lot of Jews in Poland there and stuff, and they first took the Jews and then probably the next, Polish and I still got cousins and aunts and _ living there.
  </p>
  <p id="90">
   Q: Living in Poland?

  </p>
  <p id="92">
   Q: After you left the camp, did you meet any of the surrounding population who lived around the camp.

  </p>
  <p id="94">

   Q: How did you learn about V E Day?
  </p>
  <p id="101">
   A: How did I learn? Well, it was in the papers and stuff. We were glad it was over. But, I know there is another war going on with Japan. We weren't through yet, but, that was a piece of cake, I mean, as far as after they put the atomic bomb and stuff.
  </p>
  <p id="102">
   Q: How long were you in Europe after V E Day? How long did you stay after?
  </p>
  <p id="103">
   A: Oh, I stayed until the war was over in Japan, and then they shipped me back. They must have sent some Army of Occupation or something, earlier on, to take care of that. So, like I say, we had it made_ it was a piece acake. We were playing golf we couldn't play golf because we didn't have no golf balls. But, I wanted to come home regardless, I mean, they could give me a million buck, of course, I wasn't too long overseas a year anda half oversees but in the army four and a half years. So, but it's still a long time, I mean, it's the best years of my life.
  </p>
  <p id="104">
   Q: Why so? Why do you call them the best years of your life?
  </p>
  <p id="105">
   A: Well, I went in when I was 22, 23 years old. And by the time I spent four years, or almost five years and by the time you can get out and adjusted to civilian life and I got in business and so

  </p>
  <p id="109">
   A: Not we went to some kind of acamp there in and then they gave me 300 bucks [| guess big deal for traveling expenses. So, I saved, I mean, because we were in the army, it was $21 a month. By the time you get your cleaning done and stuff, we had to wear civilian clothes and get that cleaned and, of course, we got rations (inaudible) all that free, you know. But, still in all, you go out and have a couple of beers or something and of course, beer was cheap, but you didn't I was always broke. Getting the crap game, and, you know, waiting another month. Yeah, it was rough.

  </p>
  <p id="111">
   A: First member? Q: First family member that you saw when you returned to the United States?
  </p>
  <p id="112">
   A: Well, I'll tell you truth, we didn't have a car. My dad didn't have a car, he was a foreigner. He couldn't speak English, he was a citizen. But I don't know how he got his citizenship. But, I stopped I took a train, and I stopped in the tavern I used to go to, because it was like a block and a half away, instead of going straight home, I stopped in the tavern, had some couple of beers, and they were all glad to see me there, seen some friends, and before you knew it, halfa crowd andthenI went home. They were glad to see me, and my mother had two stars in the windows, you know, she was so proud of me. But, that was it.
  </p>
  <p id="113">
   Q: What was it like for you seeing your family again, your mother and your family?
  </p>
  <p id="114">
   A: It was great. I mean, I was overjoyed, cause like I say, I didn't know how long I was going to be in the service, in the army, because, you know, you are a long ways from home and, of course, we went back on a boat, on a small boat, but we didn't come back on a Queen Mary like because, I don't know why. Well, anyway I was sure glad to get home.
  </p>
  <p id="115">
   Q: What did you do after the war?
  </p>
  <p id="116">
   A: After the war I got a job. I didn't work too long, about a year and a half, and then I got into business. My buddy's father had a restaurant. He was in partnership with a guy in Chicago close to the Loop, and they had an argument there, so he said you buy me out or I buy you out. So, he didn't have too much money, so he asked me if I would like to getinto business, and I didn't have any money, my dad didn't have any money, so my dad had to borrow money, he trusted me. I don't know why my partner in the restaurant business, he kind of figured I was you know, I could save a buck, I wasn't too _ so, he said, you'll get that back in no time. I took his word for it, and I told my dad, I says, if you can borrow some money, and my dad had some good friends and he borrowed 6,000 bucks, I think it was, and he I got in partnership with him. It worked out in no time. I paid my dad out first, and then I was sitting pretty. I bought a car, and I had a pretty good life after that, I mean, hey, while the sun was shining, because, you know, they had to go to Wisconsin to buy to slaughter. You have to get some everything was rationed not yet but, before that. And so they used to go get meat there and stuff, and I was in the restaurant business for 27 years. So, it was a cafeteria style though. But, it's not like what it is now. Now you need a cashier or a manager or a this or that or anything for you. We did have about 12, 13 employees, but we were opened up from 5:30 in the morning until 2, 3:00 the next morning, you know. But, then they start dwindling down, the neighborhood started changing. Eventually we only had breakfast and dinners, because we used to get the crowds after bowling and stuff. They didn't they cut that out, I mean, they were afraid to deliver, the neighborhood was changing, shooting and stuff. I got up here. So, [had to give it gave it up.
  </p>
  <p id="117">
   Q: Did you talk to any friends or family about your experiences in the war?
  </p>
  <p id="118">
   A: Well, I told them I didn't want to scare them. Because, my brother, he was in the navy, and he says don't tell them mom and dad that he's going back after they took care of his ship. He was anxious to get back there to kill them Japs and stuff. So, I didn't tell my mother and dad_ because my dad died when he was young, 65. And, I was my mother lived to be 100 one month short of being 100. So, she was a widower for a long time, but she was in a nursing home. And don't I mean, after she'd be better off dead than living the way she lived in a wheelchair all the time. We had a nursing home close to home in Chicago, and my sister always used to go see her every day, feeding her, and fixing her hair and stuff like that. But, that was it, I mean.
